<unk> year, I showed these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for about three million years had the size of the United States <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> of 40 percent.
<unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn't show the ice <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is, in a way, the <unk> <unk> of climate change.
It's <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
As you see, it's <unk> to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which <unk> <unk> summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years or more, it's like the blood, which here <unk> from the body.
<unk> years, it's been <unk> like this.
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> around the ocean where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that, <unk>, <unk>, are <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>
<unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>, that amount could <unk>, that amount of <unk>, <unk> this point of not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> from the water.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: She's good. <unk>: She's good. The question is if we're going to do it.
And one reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north.
This is a river in <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> has never <unk> <unk> <unk> levels.
This is the <unk> river <unk>, in the <unk> of <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, here is where the <unk>.
These <unk> are <unk>.
On the other part of the planet: <unk>, the greatest <unk> of ice on the planet.
And last month scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of ice is in <unk>, and that the <unk> <unk>, which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> at six feet of the <unk>, like <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, that a few years ago, they were <unk>.
40 percent of the world population <unk> water from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: This is the source of <unk> water of this city.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when you get, the same happens to the <unk> water.
In California, <unk> on the <unk> <unk> is 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, like you read, they're <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk>.
Sometimes, over the last 30 years, <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of <unk>.
If you look at the context of the <unk> if you can see the <unk>.
In the last five years, we've <unk> million <unk> -- 25 million <unk> -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans every day.
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk>, from <unk>, <unk> to <unk>, and on both parts of the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of the oxygen in the oceans.
The biggest <unk> of global <unk>, together to the <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and <unk> is even worse than that.
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions, together to China.
And they <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> <unk>.
These are the <unk> projects in the last year and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And so, there's a <unk> politics in our country.
The <unk> of <unk> and oil <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
<unk> image I <unk> something --
<unk> <unk>, where I live, there's been a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
You may have seen it on the <unk>.
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America.
It's success around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> of <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> â™« <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> here in America, and we grow our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> more and more <unk>.
It's <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The biggest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- don't know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk>.
This is one of them, one part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
So that's why our <unk> is <unk> a great amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth on <unk>.
Actually, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it's also a good <unk>.
So, not <unk> of climate change.
We want to do.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of it.
So I <unk> a <unk> structure to the <unk> of how much <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! <unk> are a little <unk>, but this is the sound of the <unk> technology.
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global <unk>, but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see changes everything.
Let's look at this one. This is the <unk> <unk> technology.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and what national security.
<unk>: <unk> America is in the crisis; the <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> crisis.
The <unk> that <unk> all of the <unk> of <unk>, like <unk> <unk> and <unk> oil <unk>.
Now, but there's a new, <unk> solution to <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy, in 10 years.
A <unk> plan to <unk> America to work, <unk> more <unk>, and help help <unk> global warming.
<unk>, one solution that we <unk> to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more. <unk> than <unk>.
<unk>: This is the last one.
<unk>: <unk> of energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, a new network network.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> for jobs.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
At <unk>: A old <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go, you go.
If you want to go away, you go. "
We have to go far,
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED, I did a <unk> on <unk>.
And <unk> of <unk> to <unk> about how the machine works.
So, I <unk> it. And for those who's other time, the <unk> is the greatest scientific <unk> experiment ever ever -- <unk> miles of <unk>.
His <unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> <unk> than a <unk> of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second <unk>.
All of that is just <unk>.
This is the <unk> machine.
They <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk>.
This is what I'm working on. It's called <unk> -- <unk> feet and it's a <unk> of <unk>.
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> <unk> in building so you can see the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> year, we <unk> the car for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was because of <unk> <unk> in control.
It's a picture of the first <unk> particles that had all done the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles inside the <unk>.
In other words, when I <unk> that image the 10 <unk>, I <unk> that the camera, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to <unk> us more or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that page the <unk> <unk> was this.
That means that we've had a <unk> impact beyond the scientific <unk>.
<unk> a week later, there was a problem with the car, it had to just these <unk> <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. I'm too much <unk>."
And instead they can do that because when they're very <unk> become the <unk> <unk>.
So, at least <unk> degrees, at a <unk> temperature <unk> to the space of the stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, there was a <unk> of <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> than 20 <unk>, and that's <unk> about 30 <unk>.
They have about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
They're now <unk> all the <unk> place.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be new <unk>.
<unk>, and we <unk> to get some data to <unk> or <unk>, and keep that our <unk> to find out what are the universe is.
Now, of course, in a way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering of <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult, the fact that we do that is the value of things like <unk>.
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, which, <unk>, in <unk> <unk> experiments of his <unk> was Michael <unk>, he said, "No," <unk> is so <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of human mind how the <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk>, that there are not <unk> in nature, that there are no new <unk>. "
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> to when, from children, <unk> with <unk>.
As I <unk> as <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way we <unk> most of the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects, together to my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I started to <unk>, "And if, when we use a computer, instead of having the only <unk> of the <unk> as digital <unk> that moves on a <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> information with a <unk>,
and we <unk> to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer, building <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer <unk> like a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer <unk> like a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with the hand, they can <unk> them, and they have a screen and have a screen, and they have a <unk> <unk>,
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, like <unk>, you can just <unk>.
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> to <unk> the digital information.
And as they become more <unk>, <unk> of the movement, of other, and <unk>, and as they become <unk>, <unk> of the <unk> movement, other, of how we can explore new and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show <unk>: if you put it in a direction, the <unk> <unk>, if you put it in a direction, the other side, you get back.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of other.
If you <unk> them, they <unk> them to <unk>.
If they get <unk>, they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
If they get <unk>, they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We've got to realize that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> that we could use <unk> on data, for example, "<unk> a color like it."
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> the color in the central <unk>, where they <unk>.
and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color in central <unk>, where they <unk>.
If we <unk> too much, we can <unk> a little bit of place.
There are also <unk> <unk> <unk>, like <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk>, where people can try and <unk> things where people can try things things, and <unk> the results.
I'm now --
This is a <unk> sequence that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a <unk> game of words that is <unk> between <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, at every <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk>, on every <unk>, <unk>, at every <unk>, and <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk>, and as I was <unk> to <unk> words, he <unk> on a <unk>.
Then, about 30 seconds, you get <unk>, and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Here's a <unk> children in <unk> <unk> <unk>, I did this way that I <unk> them and <unk> a video.
They're very much.
And one of the interesting things about this <unk> of <unk> is that you don't have to give people many <unk>.
They just say, "<unk> <unk> of words," and they know exactly what they do.
Here's what you're <unk>.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, there on the right.
It actually wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
You could build a tool for the <unk> of <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
So, it's <unk> out the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now, it took a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work!
So, <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can make the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the open open, and it can decide how to do it.
<unk>: It's a story with the open open, and it can decide how to do it.
<unk>: <unk> away, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, made of <unk>, and I <unk> music.
It's a tool, made recently recently, to <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> <unk> here are <unk> as <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of these <unk> four different <unk>, and you can choose what to use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> <unk> in a <unk> sequence.
And they just <unk> by doing a <unk>, "sound" and a <unk> sequence. "
These are actually that you can control the live live, like <unk> and <unk>.
It <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk>.
And then there are the <unk> effects of time and <unk>, that <unk> <unk> to the whole sequence.
It's going to be like this.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, "sequence," <unk> in a series, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
Now, let's <unk> a <unk> line.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: Now, <unk> <unk> --
<unk>: <unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk> <unk>, so I can control the effect from live.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> the whole sequence <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> or the other.
<unk>: <unk>: And now we <unk> the <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> the sequence of the <unk> <unk>. "
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk> more <unk> or more <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the whole sequence <unk> <unk> on the left the <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work.
And today, I've had time to show you one of the results of this path, and some possibility that we try to get out of the lab.
And the concept I want to <unk> is that <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with media, which <unk> information in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the <unk> of you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more than this, of course.
It's also the love and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't think that can change.
But, I said this, one particular success has been <unk> in my life and in my career, who <unk> me to <unk> the whole <unk> with this work.
The particular thing is that I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, for some reason to <unk>, for some reason to <unk> a big, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that <unk> everywhere, people <unk> me as if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to go to me, and they say, "You don't fear of them not, you don't know, you don't know, you're not going to do it?
You don't have fear to write all the life without having any more <unk> to make a book that can <unk> to somebody? "
that can <unk>? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could be worse, part of what I remember the most 20 years ago, when I was saying people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I'm going to go to the same <unk> <unk> by fear.
And people said, "Don't know, I'm not going to be able to be successful?
You don't have fear <unk> <unk> <unk>?
You don't have fear of this <unk> <unk> all life without anything else is going to be out and die on a <unk> of <unk> dreams with the <unk> <unk>'s mouth with the <unk> of <unk>? "
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "You."
Yeah, I'm afraid of all those things.
I've <unk> fear.
And I also'm afraid of many other things that people can't <unk>.
As the <unk> and other things <unk>.
But, as it's about writing what I thought I thought and <unk> <unk> is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel born for doing.
But what's about this particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a way that other <unk> don't make it?
How did my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I don't remember one time in her 40 years of activity where asked was if she was <unk> to be <unk> <unk>?
It was never -- that <unk> of John <unk>, how does it go?
Don't <unk>, <unk>?
<unk>, <unk> engineers like no group of course, in <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not only <unk> but <unk> of all these, we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
And they don't know, you look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, young people and often <unk> them.
And even those who don't seem to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before she died, in the last <unk> <unk> said, "Every book my book <unk> me a little more <unk> about the work of your life.
But we don't know, <unk>, when we've heard these things so much as we've heard these things so much we have <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are kind of <unk> and <unk> are some <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> all here today is: you agree with this idea?
It's good about this thing -- because it's also <unk> by a <unk> distance to me, it's not good for anything.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better <unk> our big <unk> <unk> to live.
And I certainly know that, in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I'm in my career.
<unk> -- <unk> look, I'm pretty young, I've got 40 years.
I have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything <unk> <unk> in the world as the work that will <unk> after the world as the work that <unk> after the <unk> of my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all about about <unk> friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, <unk>, that thinking!
You know this is the kind of thought that brings a person to <unk> <unk> at nine in the morning and I don't want to do it.
I'm going to keep doing this work that I love.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so I think, after many <unk>, that the way of working to keep doing is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk>, OK?
I have to have to get a <unk> distance of security between me, which I'm <unk>, and my natural <unk> on what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. And while I <unk> it all last year models on how to do we start looking through the time, looking at the time, trying to find out through time, trying to find some other society to see if you have better ideas and <unk>,
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research took me to the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk> because they <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that <unk> creativity from men, OK?
It's <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from a few <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> reasons and <unk>, for <unk> reasons and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity of creativity <unk> <unk>. "
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> were the same idea, but I'm going to have that kind of spirit without a <unk>.
which is <unk>, because the <unk> don't really understand that a <unk> <unk> was a particularly,
I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of a artist, a little bit like the <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> out of <unk> <unk>, and <unk> out of that <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, that's the distance of which I'm talking about -- that <unk> <unk> that <unk> you from the results of your work.
And everybody <unk> that was so that I <unk>, right?
So, the <unk> artists were <unk> to <unk> things, like the too <unk>, how do you know, right?
If your work was <unk>, you don't have to <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, everybody <unk> that <unk> state from this <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If your work <unk>, it was not all <unk> your <unk>, right?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
And then the <unk> <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> this big idea; we put the human center on the universe above all of the universe and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without <unk> space to <unk> <unk> from the <unk>.
This was the <unk> principle of <unk> and people started thinking about that creativity is <unk> by <unk>.
And for the first time in the history, you get to this or that artist as a rather <unk> that one person with the <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think that was a big <unk>.
I think that <unk> to somebody, a simple person who believe that I think about being like a <unk> like the source, the <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> of human <unk>.
It's like to ask somebody to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> and <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure to <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years.
And, if that's true, and I think that's the question is, and the question?
Can we do that?
It's going to go back to a more <unk> understanding of human relationship between <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
Or maybe not.
<unk> we can't <unk> 500 years of <unk> thinking in a 18 minutes.
And probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, <unk>, you make people <unk> <unk> <unk> about their projects.
You probably don't <unk> all about this thing.
But the question I want to <unk> is -- why not?
Why don't we <unk> this way?
Because it's more sense of everything that I've ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> of <unk> process.
A process that, as anyone who has ever <unk> to do something -- so, so, basically, everybody here -- knows, you don't know <unk> <unk>.
And, in fact, it can look at <unk>.
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years, but that was a <unk> for all life and she said that during her <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, and I <unk> it, inside the <unk>, and I <unk> it, inside, and I <unk> it, inside if you <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
And she said that it was like a <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> towards her from the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> to get, because she made the land under his feet.
I decided to have one thing to do at that point and it was of, words, "<unk> like a <unk>."
And so I was going to go home and she was <unk> by this <unk>, and it wouldn't have to have to make anything else that's a piece of paper and a <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> on the page.
Sometimes I couldn't go back to be enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> <unk> through and she would be able to <unk> through the <unk>, looking, how she said, "another <unk>."
And then there were those times -- this piece't <unk> it ever -- there were some moments where the was almost <unk>, right?
So, she was <unk> home and she was looking at the paper and the <unk> <unk> through, and he <unk> a <unk> right in the while she was <unk>, and she was, and she was going to, and she was going to go.
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in her body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> but the <unk>, on the <unk>, the last word at the first word at the first word at the first <unk>.
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not all my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; it's <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work and <unk> on <unk>.
But even me, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I'm going to say that many of you the <unk> did.
You know, even though the work and the ideas that I could not be <unk> <unk>.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it in a way that we don't lose your head, but rather, what does it <unk> <unk>?
And as it's the best example, I've got is the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I <unk> different years ago for a <unk>.
<unk> about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk>, trying to control, <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then <unk>, she <unk>, and one day as she was <unk> on a <unk> <unk>, <unk> everything.
<unk> <unk>, and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk>, who comes in his head as a <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and the <unk>, but not know how to <unk>.
It's not a piece of paper, no <unk>, no <unk>. It's not a <unk>.
So it starts to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> <unk> in him like, "I'm going to <unk>, and I'm going to <unk>, and I'm going to go from this <unk> song.
I'm not enough <unk> and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of going to go to the <unk>, they <unk>.
<unk> the whole process and made something completely new.
I just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>," <unk>, don't see that I'm <unk>? "
"You know, what do you can write a song now?
If you really want to <unk> <unk>, <unk> in a more <unk> moment when I can take care of you.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his <unk> process, <unk> <unk> after this.
Not the work, the work was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that out of him <unk>, the <unk> that out of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where he was, who didn't have to be a thing <unk> and <unk>.
but I <unk> this <unk>, wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that <unk> and <unk> that <unk>, but it wasn't <unk>.
So how much <unk> that story is going to change a little bit of how I <unk> and already <unk> me once and I <unk> it.
This idea, I <unk> when I was <unk>, "<unk>," and I <unk>, "and I <unk> it in one of the <unk> of the <unk> where we're all working on something and you can't think that and you start thinking that it will be a <unk>, that that's going to be the book.
Not just <unk>, just <unk> <unk> book.
And I started thinking about <unk> this project.
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> the air and <unk> us.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and I <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room.
And I said to <unk>, "<unk>, what, both we know that if this book is not going to be <unk>, isn't it?
Because as you see, I'm <unk> everything I have, I don't have any more about this.
So if you want it to be better, you have to <unk> and do your part.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what, you don't know what.
I started writing the same because it's my work.
And I would like to be <unk> that I'm <unk> to do my part of my part. "Because at the end is so, OK -- <unk> -- <unk> in the <unk> of the North people <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> music that <unk> hours to <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk>.
But every single single <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know what I'm going to talk about what I'm going to do, because I know that you've got all seen, at a <unk>.
It was like if you <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it wasn't doing anything else else from the <unk>, like the <unk> <unk> before, but everything <unk>.
And suddenly, not <unk> <unk> as a human.
But they <unk> out of <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
And when this <unk>, people <unk> what was, the people <unk> what was, he <unk> her name.
<unk> your hands and <unk> <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "God," God, "
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, "which you can feel in <unk> or in <unk>.
In <unk>, when a artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
And it's <unk> because we need.
But, the problem is coming up the day after, for <unk> itself, when you <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of God's <unk> and <unk> <unk> of God is not there.
It's just a <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and maybe not <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still as she <unk>, and what does it has to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to make in a <unk> life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be that <unk> if you can't believe, <unk>, <unk>, that the most <unk> of your being being <unk> by you.
But let me just <unk> that data in <unk> from a <unk> source of this part of your life that you have to go to <unk> <unk>.
And, you know, if we think that, in this way, it changes.
And so I started to <unk>, and it's certainly like I <unk> for several months during the <unk> of the book that I'm going to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>,
And what I have to keep <unk> when I feel that is, I'm not afraid.
Don't <unk>. <unk> only your job.
<unk> <unk> for your part, any of any <unk> can be.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, you're going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for one moment through your <unk>, then, "<unk>!"
<unk>, you do the same your <unk>.
And <unk>! "<unk>!" <unk>! "
I think, and I think it's <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>!" <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
As you know, I've talked about some of these projects on human genome, what can <unk> and <unk> on discovery of new <unk> genes.
We're now <unk> a new <unk>, we started <unk> biology and now <unk> biology and now from that digital code, we're <unk> into a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We've always been trying to make big questions.
"<unk> is life?" It's something that many <unk> have <unk>, I think they have <unk> to understand at different levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to <unk> terms.
We're <unk> for almost 20 years.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> <unk> from <unk> world of <unk> biology to the digital world.
Now, <unk> us: can we <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is the <unk> species from the <unk> genome between those who can <unk> into the lab.
And we tried to reduce <unk> <unk> the genome to <unk> one even smaller smaller.
We can <unk> a <unk> of the genes about 500 that are here.
But when we take a look at his map, it's simple than our.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at the time, it's very <unk> that can bring a <unk> cell.
So, I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of "Can we <unk> a <unk>?"
Can the chemistry <unk> of making these big molecules that we've never been able to create before?
And, in case, can we make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material.
The speed we're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
Our ability to write the <unk> code, instead, <unk> rather slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> results <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We <unk> over 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before I <unk> the first experiments.
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA, of 30 to 50 <unk> and it's a <unk> process, the <unk> is a <unk> process: the <unk> is long,
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, from digital information of the genome of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a small virus that <unk> bacteria.
We designed <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> about <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in bacteria, bacteria have <unk> to read this code code and <unk> the <unk> particles.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> out of cells, they're <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I talked about recently with the <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have certainly <unk> this model.
They have more than you.
And I think that's a situation where the software can really build the same <unk> into a <unk> system.
But we could make the greatest things in the big.
<unk> building the whole <unk> of <unk>.
They're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought about <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell.
<unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> <unk> information into a computer, these must be very <unk>.
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We found, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If we were using that original sequence never <unk> that original <unk> <unk>,
A part of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> to build smaller smaller <unk> than <unk> together.
<unk> elements here.
You probably read that <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: We have a <unk> <unk> code on four <unk>: A, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order to <unk>.
So we can use the <unk> code for writing words, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did we at the beginning was <unk>.
Some have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> <unk>.
And we started <unk> parts of <unk>, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In every step, we have produced these <unk> <unk> <unk> because we're <unk> that we're trying to create a very <unk> <unk> <unk> as you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems like the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
When I started these <unk> much <unk>, more than 100 <unk> <unk>, not to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You get to the <unk> of <unk> biology.
So we have <unk> other <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA to <unk> the <unk>.
Here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
In 12 -- hours, it's <unk> exactly like it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do this.
These organisms can <unk> completely.
We're going to live under <unk>.
They're absolutely absolutely sure life <unk> in space, and they <unk> to find new <unk> of water.
And so, NASA showed that this happens.
This is a picture of the <unk> that we built using these <unk>, just using the <unk> with the <unk> design of <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we've done a little time ago.
They're more than <unk> <unk> code.
It's the greatest <unk> of a <unk> structure that we've ever <unk> from man.
It has a <unk> weight for 300 million.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk>, and we <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> code.
Now, how do we do it work? How do we <unk> it?
Of course, through a <unk> virus is a game game from kids.
It's a little more <unk> when you use bacteria.
It's <unk> just when it's about <unk> cells like our: you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is basically the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, the <unk> <unk> is instead of <unk> into the cell, but we <unk> <unk> that we're able to make a <unk> <unk> of a cell to another and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a species <unk>.
<unk> are different as men as <unk>.
We <unk> some <unk> <unk> more <unk> <unk> in a way that you can decide what to do to do.
And then he <unk> with the <unk> <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And <unk> <unk> that we don't have to go beyond, but we tried to <unk> it.
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere, <unk>, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who think about evolution as one <unk> at the time that <unk> <unk> has not understood much of biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that was in the cell not <unk> one.
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> like <unk> material, <unk> <unk>, and we <unk> it with only the cell and the new <unk>.
It has become blue because of the genes that we <unk>.
And in a short <unk> of time, all the <unk> of a species are <unk>, and it <unk> of all of the new <unk>, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> into the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, and the <unk> are <unk>, and when you get the <unk> code, exactly what we <unk> have <unk>.
Now, this may seem <unk> <unk>, but we <unk> the software, we can change things in a enough way.
Now, I've already <unk> that <unk> <unk> -- but of progress from three million years and a half years of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of <unk> <unk> in which we <unk> <unk> new species of <unk> on this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk>.
We're going to go from six billion and a half the next 40 years.
Right to give a example: I was born in <unk>.
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk>; in 40 years, there will be four.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion people.
They're going to have to do it for nine billion.
<unk> than five billion <unk>, more than 30 billion <unk> of <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it will be a huge challenge.
And we have to realize all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere.
And so, in the day, because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are <unk> <unk> for the future.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> only one <unk> about <unk>, and think about how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from reality and our imagination.
Now we have <unk>, because of these <unk> <unk> <unk>, able to create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We can make a big robot that can make a <unk> robot that can make a million <unk> a day.
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> of <unk> <unk> to make <unk> <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, because of a small team, and create more <unk> biology now in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard <unk>.
We can choose to <unk> <unk>, chemistry or <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some software software software <unk> that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how they're going to be.
We know exactly how their <unk> code.
We're going to <unk> on the <unk> generation.
You've seen that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was an experiment.
We <unk> the second and third generation that <unk> enough as soon as as <unk> as <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter before, where we're working for <unk> cells, and we're working on to design cells that can achieve this purpose, and we think we can get the first <unk> generation of <unk> in about 18 months.
<unk> <unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> <unk>, but in our <unk> <unk>, and we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the ocean ocean, about <unk> feet of <unk> of water.
<unk> <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as much like the source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2, that can be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So, the short <unk> we think that we can be able to <unk> what the question is, "life," We, we <unk> the <unk> goal of the whole <unk> industry.
<unk>. If you can't do that TED, where can't that?
It's a <unk> source of energy.
<unk>, we're working for using the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we're always back a year and with a dollar in less when it's about a dollar in less when it's about a <unk> <unk>.
I think what you can change by building <unk> <unk>.
That's how the future might start to look like <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the tree with bacteria, <unk>, and then <unk> cells.
We're so much about how much <unk> people.
Our purpose is to make it so that we're going to be enough to try to <unk>. Thank you very much.
<unk> I'm going to show you, the <unk> <unk> possible, some <unk> work, some <unk> work, the new technology that we took a <unk> <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago. This is <unk>.
It's a environment where you can <unk> is <unk> local level that you can <unk> with a huge amount of <unk> data.
We're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a fast <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how much the amount of information that we see, how much of the big <unk> of data or images.
Most of them are <unk> photographs, but this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, and I <unk> it in the <unk> of 300 <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, example of data, not of images.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
And so, to <unk> that's just about the text and not of images, we can do something like that, to make really see that it's about a real <unk> of the text, not a picture.
It could be a way to read a <unk> book.
I'm not going to <unk> it.
This is an example more <unk>. It's a <unk> <unk>.
Every picture is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the <unk> and the beautiful experience of reading the real <unk> version of a <unk>, which is a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk> kind of a half.
We also did something with the corner of this particular <unk> of The <unk>.
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much <unk> than what you use is using in a normal <unk>, and we <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or other models, or even <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
And I thought this <unk> <unk> to put the <unk> and other <unk> <unk>, not to be <unk>.
Of course, <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this, I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have <unk> to <unk>.
These are all the <unk> in the United States <unk> above a NASA picture of the <unk>.
So now I'm going to go to something else.
This is actually live in the web; you can go back to the web; you can go and see.
It's a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
A <unk> is <unk> and the other is a very interesting research that we made by <unk> <unk>, a <unk> student of Washington, with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive in the web, <unk> <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of images here has actually actually <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> have been <unk> these images together, so that they <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk>. So you see the elements of the elements of a <unk> <unk> or <unk>, and these things are all <unk> at the <unk> level.
I don't know if I've got time to show you some other environment.
There are some much more <unk>.
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we've done for the first time, I <unk> to show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology, the technology <unk>. And it's not <unk> as much as <unk> as we've <unk> at the website.
We had to <unk> <unk> <unk> and forth.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> images from <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of types of <unk> and <unk> images of types of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and saying. <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture that's discovery.
So I'm all <unk> images and have been <unk> <unk> and they're all <unk> at this way.
And it's possible to <unk> this <unk> way.
You know, I would never have thought of <unk> work for <unk>.
It's very <unk> <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think that I'm going to see that it's a lot of different kinds of <unk>: from those phones to <unk> <unk>, a number, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can, I can try and find those <unk> <unk>.
A lot of these are <unk> <unk>, etc.
<unk> a few part here is a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment.
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now <unk> by <unk> from the whole memory of how to <unk> the land, from the point of view, and <unk> <unk> all of that data together.
All those pictures become <unk> together, more than the <unk>.
You have a model of land that <unk>.
Think about this as the <unk> of <unk> <unk> on Earth <unk>.
It's something that <unk> in <unk> complexity that people <unk>, and the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> with the use.
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name, my picture of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> all of that data, and I can use as a <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> in space, in that <unk>, in that <unk>, using the photos of everyone else, and having a social experience, and <unk> <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of all of this is <unk> <unk> <unk> of every <unk> of the land, <unk> not only by <unk> <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> and <unk>, but from <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
Chris Anderson: I understood? What's good? What your software <unk> us to do is that at some point, in the next years, all the photographs of them in the world, are going to be <unk> together?
<unk>: Yeah. What's doing is basically, we're going to find out.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's <unk> it's <unk> the content of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of <unk> <unk> that many of these images <unk>.
As you do a research of images on the web, you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the web has a lot about about images of the pictures.
Now, what's going on if that picture <unk> all of your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous. It's a <unk> effect of the network.
CA: <unk>, it's really incredible. <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>.
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that they can live in who has no <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> the past, the wind, the <unk> <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> of plants.
<unk> to think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still beyond <unk> <unk> <unk>, or that the <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> of <unk>, or <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, to remember the <unk> <unk>, to remember the <unk> <unk>, and that the idea that the world we live in which the world we live in in which is not there is no matter in <unk>, but only one of reality,
And the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done, good or bad, a lot of <unk> does.
And, of course, all of the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
We're <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death <unk>, so we don't know if you <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song, the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they're the <unk> of <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
And he was my <unk> journey in <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, on the <unk>, the <unk> mother's <unk>.
All these <unk> <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways to move in the world.
And if you take a second, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it's important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk>.
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the total <unk> of all the <unk>, dreams, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as as much as <unk> species.
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was successful and <unk> much more quickly.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all the species has been or on the <unk> of <unk>, because it's <unk>, or <unk> -- in the <unk> <unk> -- and you don't even <unk> <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> diversity.
The <unk> of this is, of course, the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules.
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the middle of which the <unk> of every culture comes in in the material world.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we're here sitting here at least half the <unk> is not <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They're not <unk> to children, which means to say, unless you know something, which are already death.
What's more <unk> than being <unk> by the <unk>, of being the last to talk about a language, of not having a way to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, or <unk> the children?
This <unk> <unk> was a few weeks, and every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks, every two weeks: every two weeks, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know that somebody of you know, "<unk>'t that better?
The world wouldn't be a better place if we <unk> all the same language? "<unk>, then we talk about <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> of a <unk> thing means that we can't talk about your language.
Today I'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a small journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us <unk> that when I say, "different ways of <unk>," I really mean, "I really mean," I really mean different ways of <unk>.
<unk> for example this <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, which <unk> to <unk> <unk> from the river <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that is not able to <unk> the blue color from the green because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the forest, where the <unk> <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule, <unk> <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>," You have to <unk> a person <unk> <unk> to the <unk> language.
And all of this <unk> <unk>, though the <unk> is that in these families <unk> where they talk about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> nobody basically a language.
You can start to listen and then you start talking about.
I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived, the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They made <unk> by the <unk> photographs that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> forest <unk> has never seen anything about <unk>.
They <unk> the picture from land, <unk> <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> and, not <unk>, they <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk>.
But <unk> don't just <unk> the <unk>.
They <unk> between them.
<unk> percent of the <unk> <unk> was <unk> by their own.
We're <unk> eight <unk> and found two cases of death and found two cases of death and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was so that dead <unk>, and then <unk> <unk> it.
The <unk> can recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> species.
I was early '<unk>, I was <unk> a very interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> <unk>, if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>
And to give a sense of <unk>, I should have understanding the <unk> culture and that <unk> is not <unk>.
It's pretty much about a <unk> <unk> view of the world.
Very interesting.
If you <unk> to <unk> the big <unk> of the world, what do I'm going to <unk>?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent is always left out, thinking that Africa <unk> doesn't have <unk> <unk>. And instead, and the <unk> is not else that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes interesting is <unk> <unk> is the <unk> relationship between life and death.
So <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the live in the way that for a short moment the <unk> becomes the <unk>.
So this <unk> <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk> go to <unk> to talk about God.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And from the moment that you're <unk>, is the spirit that you can get you, how do you get you <unk>?
So, you <unk> to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of the mind of the body when it's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> all the <unk> that I lived the most <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a <unk> continent of blood, this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk>.
In <unk>, I'm <unk> by a <unk>, but their education is extraordinary <unk>.
The young <unk> are <unk> away from <unk> to three or four years, and live <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years.
Two years <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
For all this time, they get <unk> to the values of their society, values that <unk> their <unk> and only <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And so this <unk> <unk>, they get <unk> out and for the first time in their life, at age of 18 years, see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk> of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, everything that they've learned in <unk> theory, all that they've learned in the <unk> <unk>. The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and says,
"<unk>? <unk> how I said.
It's <unk>. Now it's about you <unk>. "
They call <unk> <unk> and they say that we, <unk> <unk> <unk>, we're the <unk> of the world's <unk>.
This level of <unk> is extremely important.
When we think of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these are <unk> <unk> <unk> to the Earth.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk> by the <unk>.
There's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>, but because of the time and <unk>, they created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk> <unk>, but on a <unk> <unk>, but on a <unk> <unk>, but on a <unk> <unk>, the concept that the Earth can only live because it's because it's <unk> by human <unk> <unk>.
What does that mean?
I mean that a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> will be a <unk> human <unk>, and it will have a different human being <unk> <unk> different with the mountain or that place with a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
That's the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
That made me a human being different human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If we start to <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different, <unk> to start understanding their <unk>. They <unk> this <unk>.
I <unk> this picture in <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes <unk> <unk> is not the <unk> potential of <unk>, but her <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On one side, this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> of the family <unk> said <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you're going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> that make a different <unk> of species, <unk> has <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. <unk>'t create a <unk> of the reality.
I often <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> <unk> the <unk>, with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the '<unk>.
<unk> my <unk> is not <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you've done, because if you're not <unk> to be <unk>. <unk>, but they can't be <unk> because they're <unk> by a <unk> that's of course, in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> only if we could <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk>.
Now, the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> <unk>, the same kind of <unk>, the same <unk> to <unk> the <unk>. The question is, in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants, how these <unk> <unk> <unk>, how these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and the <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if we go to the <unk>, we <unk> "The plants are talking about."
What does that mean?
This <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, who <unk> <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that our <unk> eyes in the forest itself.
If the <unk> like <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>," <unk> "<unk>." You don't know everything? "I said," No. "
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a night night full <unk> and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk>.
And so you don't get <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk> <unk>.
Now, [<unk>] the problem is that even those of us who have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> them, but somehow, <unk> to the <unk> of the world than our real world, and <unk> beyond.
In fact, the <unk> century, in 300 years, not <unk> <unk> for her <unk> or his <unk> <unk>, but rather as the was where we <unk> and we <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the mass <unk> of the <unk> diversity and <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> to new possibility of life.
And the problem is not technology.
The <unk> <unk> don't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> as they <unk> don't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put out and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And if you look at the world, I'm not <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
They are <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has lived <unk> <unk> in the forest until a generation ago, and now <unk> the <unk> and <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that looks like <unk> <unk> away from the <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>,
<unk> <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in the case of <unk>, are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk>.
If you <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, where I'm doing lots of research, you'll see the <unk> <unk> of the political <unk>.
As a <unk>, the <unk> physics of a <unk>, is <unk> <unk> at the <unk>, but <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, not only is is <unk>, but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's part of the development.
And you can't understand the <unk> of <unk> until you get part of the beginning.
I've <unk> miles in the Western China through the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only <unk> to <unk> what's behind the <unk> I realized that I'm going to talk about.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
And that means that it's been <unk> to the Chinese <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and her <unk> was being <unk>.
It was taken of <unk> <unk> at age of two years <unk> under his <unk> because she couldn't have a <unk> <unk> because she couldn't have a <unk> of him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk>.
A day <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for this <unk>, and it was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> for seven years.
The pain of <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> by present.
And then it <unk> up to the end, all you get a choice.
We live in the world's <unk> or we want to <unk> the world's <unk>?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk>, before she died said that her greatest fear was that, in our greatest <unk> <unk>, in our way to go to this <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world, not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of thinking, but one day we <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibility.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, which gave us agriculture, which <unk> us to <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world <unk> <unk> <unk>.
That <unk> story, I don't know that we have the answers to all the challenges that we could <unk> in the <unk> to come.
When we're looking at these <unk> of the world is <unk> what it means to be human, <unk> with <unk> different <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we're: a <unk> species, that has to make sure all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there's big times of <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the north of <unk> island, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and this man, <unk>, <unk> me the wonderful story of her <unk>.
The <unk> government is not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the '<unk> to <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them into <unk>.
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk>.
The family, <unk> for her life, <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, and all his <unk>.
You want to know that <unk> don't <unk> the cold, <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> fish were made of <unk> fish <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> by night or <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> away, you <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand. When I did it <unk>, <unk> it <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, she <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> created a <unk>, <unk> another dog and it's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> to talk about <unk>? [<unk>] And this, in different ways, [<unk>] is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> <unk> to <unk> the total area of a larger <unk> of California and <unk> <unk>.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. <unk> all the <unk> resources.
A <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, to end, I think it's rather <unk> at least at least at least at the <unk> of the planet, <unk> that they don't have at all.
For somebody is home.
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the time. And for us, the dreams of these children, like the dreams of our children, become part of the <unk> of hope.
And so, we're <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, we're <unk> that <unk> never <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> are not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we're the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our site <unk> <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience to <unk> our public places of <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from what they <unk> <unk> from what they've seen and, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, the world of <unk> in diversity, and we have to find a <unk> <unk> of life in a <unk> world.
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I'm going to <unk> you've heard of other that you've heard and <unk> to <unk> some <unk>, in the case, I don't <unk> them.
I want to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk> <unk>."
<unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> society <unk> <unk>. The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens," The way to do it is <unk> the freedom. "
The reason is, on one side, in fact that the freedom is itself a value, is <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for human beings.
And it's in fact that if we're <unk>, each of us can act to do all of us can act to do everything that <unk> our <unk>, without nobody that in the name of our <unk>.
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> the choice.
More choices people, the more <unk>, and more and more is their freedom, and more is their <unk>.
This is, <unk> <unk> <unk> in society that nobody's <unk> to <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress <unk> has made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there's no <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody of <unk> <unk> is <unk> of your <unk>.
Here's what <unk> is how <unk>.
Then you go to the <unk> store to buy a <unk> <unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> store, there's a great number of <unk> <unk>.
We can make six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are one store in a <unk>.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice.
<unk> fields: the world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a child, you could get all the <unk> <unk>, <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
You <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
And a <unk> of that, between the other, was that the phone you don't <unk>.
These days they went to.
We have a <unk> almost <unk> <unk> of <unk>, especially between cell phones.
Here's the cell phones.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you don't have seen it in the <unk> <unk>, you're pretty much that you're going to be <unk>.
And what happens is that people <unk> <unk> and make this question is that people <unk> and make this question. And you know, the answer is, "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't make <unk> things.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>, not happens in the United States that you get out of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you what you have to do.
Instead, I'm going to get out of the <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK," A, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>,"
You <unk>, what do you want to do? "
And the <unk> says, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you say, "<unk> if you were, what do you know?"
And the <unk> said, "But I'm not her."
The result we call it "<unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk>, "<unk> that makes it seem a good thing.
But, in fact, it's not that one <unk> the weight and the responsibility to make sure that you know anything -- and it's not about -- and it's <unk> -- and so not in the <unk> <unk>, and so not in the <unk> <unk> to make the patient,
There's a huge <unk> of <unk> products, <unk> people like me and you, that if you think about not make sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we get them?
The answer is that they want to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of how much our <unk> is a question of choice, how we see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> kids. We don't want to <unk> kids. We don't understand a <unk>: we have to <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
And that means that every <unk>, you have to decide that kind of person being like.
<unk> the family and the <unk>, a <unk> time perspective, and <unk> <unk> to everyone, was that <unk> the <unk> as possible, and you get <unk> to the <unk> as possible as possible.
The only real choice was, who, not when, and not even what to do after.
<unk>, everything is really to play.
They start very smart students, and they <unk> their 20 percent less than a time.
And not because they're not <unk>, because they're not <unk>.
But why I'm <unk>, I'm going to <unk>, "<unk> <unk>, or not?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> later?" I have to think about the children or the career? "
They're <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even though this <unk> is not going to get the <unk> that <unk> and not get a good <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to do that. They have to be important questions.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, like <unk> <unk> <unk>, because technology allows us to work every minute, every day, on the planet, <unk> that from <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I'm not going to say, where the <unk> works.
I'm not going to tell you, because I want to use it.
What does this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work? Is that we have to decide, <unk> at every moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our child, <unk>, with the <unk> in a <unk>, the <unk> in the other, and the <unk>, <unk>, on <unk>.
And even if I'm all <unk>, every minute that we see our son, <unk> the <unk>, we're also <unk>, "I have to answer this call?"
"I have to answer this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And even when the answer is, "no," that makes this <unk> of your <unk>'s <unk> of your son much different than what would would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of them, little, <unk>, small objects and big, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibility, but not everything was a question of choice.
The world today <unk> to this: The world's <unk> is, "It's a <unk> thing, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> we know, so I'm going to talk about the <unk>.
<unk> that choice <unk> two effects of people.
The first one, <unk>, is that <unk> <unk> instead of <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> between which you choose, it becomes very difficult to do.
I'm going to give you a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, with about a million <unk> <unk>, with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> of two percent.
With 50 <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent <unk> than <unk> at the time they are only five. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> between which you choose, is <unk> difficult to decide, and the choice is <unk> to <unk>.
And <unk>, and still <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk> will never get.
<unk> that doesn't just mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don't have enough money, it wants to say that the decision is so <unk> that it also <unk> the decision is so <unk> that it also <unk> the decision <unk> of work.
They don't <unk>, they're <unk> up to five <unk> <unk> for year from <unk> <unk>, which would be <unk> <unk>.
So the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> choices.
And I think that <unk> the world.
"And to end, for <unk>: <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
<unk>, right, if it's the <unk>, if it's for <unk>, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong <unk>, and <unk> the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even though we can <unk> the <unk> and make a choice, at the end, we're less <unk> by the result of how we <unk> <unk> with.
And that's why I'm going to do this for several reasons.
One of these is that with many <unk> between which <unk>, if you <unk> one and not not perfect, it's not perfect, right, it's easy to imagine that it could make a different choice that would be better. And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> the <unk> of choice, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the decision,
And even when it was a <unk> decision.
<unk> choices there are, easier to <unk> than <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, there's what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> <unk> very well <unk> as the value that we give things <unk> things from what we give them.
<unk>, when there's a lot of <unk> possible, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and being <unk> <unk> and being <unk>.
Here's an example. I'm <unk> with all those who are not in New York.
But that's what it's probably <unk>.
There's this <unk> to the <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all about it.
I'm not going to <unk> anything. But what he thinks is, "Well, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are away."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>."
And it goes two weeks from the idea that's <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when choice was <unk>.
And the more is the <unk> that we have <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> us <unk> against how to <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about living the moment, and maybe we live in slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you're <unk>, you know, you're not going to be doing other.
The things that don't <unk> have many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
I tried to my skin a new couple of <unk>.
<unk> always <unk>.
Once the <unk> were just like, <unk> them and <unk> <unk>, were <unk>, only after <unk>, were <unk>, only after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times, I started going to go.
So, I went to <unk> a couple of <unk>, when the <unk> were gone, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
<unk> <unk> said, "<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>?"
They want them to <unk> or <unk>? "<unk>" <unk> "or" <unk> "<unk>"?
"Are them want to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --" <unk> to <unk>. "<unk> <unk>."
I was <unk>, and after a little bit I was able to say, "I want the guy -- that was the only guy," I had no idea what it was, so for a <unk> <unk> me, and I <unk> it out of the store, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with the best of <unk> I had ever had.
It was the <unk>. With all that choice I had <unk> the best.
But I'm going to get worse.
Why? I wrote a whole book for <unk>.
And the reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
I was <unk> <unk>. I didn't know anything about <unk> when I just had one guy, but when I <unk> a lot of it, but when I <unk> 100 different, <unk>, at least one guy had to be perfect.
What I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
And after I had <unk> that I was <unk> in <unk> to the <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people don't make the <unk> that these <unk> <unk> that these <unk> <unk>.
And this <unk> <unk>, even when the results are good.
No one in the world of <unk> if they realize it.
Because if I <unk> it, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is going to be more at this.
"You know," You know, "The reason why you get it better when you know, it's worse, when you know, it was <unk> as possible as much as much as possible as <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world where we live -- <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk> of <unk>.
You've never never <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>," Yeah, you want it. "
I mean -- small moment, <unk> -- that I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't have to do better, I'm not <unk>.
But <unk> don't always have a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk>, when there's just that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you say, "Why?"
"Who's <unk>?" The answer is <unk>. "
The world is the <unk>. What could I do?
When there's hundreds of <unk>, and I <unk> a <unk>, and I'm going to tell you who is the <unk>, it's clear that the <unk> are you.
They could make better.
With hundreds of <unk> available, there are no <unk> for <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even if the result is <unk>, they <unk> <unk> and give them <unk> and give them <unk> to them.
In the last years, the <unk> <unk> world.
I think that a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have <unk> experiences because the standard are too much <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is them.
So the final result is that we're better, <unk>, but we'll <unk>.
Let me show you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we take for good and it's not true.
There's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all, but by this is not <unk> that much better than a little bit better than a little bit.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure we've <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our life.
Now, from the <unk> <unk> -- I almost finished -- from the point of view, <unk> is the <unk>.
What it allows all this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you have <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice.
The problem is that they have too much <unk>.
So the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> society.
And what <unk> does and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to you yesterday about how much those <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, is not that they're just <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk>.
They make worse.
If a little bit of what we can do is <unk> choice to be <unk> in those where people have too few possibilities, it wouldn't just be their life to <unk>, but even our <unk>.
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of income is good at all -- not just the poor people -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us.
And so, you can become all you want to become what you want to --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>, "What do you get that fish?"
"It's <unk> that you can't make anything in a <unk> of glass."
"A <unk> <unk>, a <unk> view of the world --"
and I <unk> it so, I <unk> it, at the beginning.
But then, <unk>, instead, I realized that that the <unk> knows that fish knows.
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk>, <unk>, so that it's not possible, you can't <unk> the freedom.
If you <unk> the <unk> so that it could <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
They all need a <unk>.
This is almost too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you very much.
