And last year I showed these slides to show that the calculatory calculator, which for almost three million years has had had the size of 48 million years has had the size of 48 percent of the continental size --
But this underpace the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice.
The arty glacial calottoo, in a sense, the clean heart of the global climate system.
You get the inverse and return into the summer of the summer.
The next deather is going to be a quick cardly in the last 25 years.
The glaciers are red-to-red-to-red-to-red-to-to-away.
As you see, they expand they expand it up to the blue scale --
That's the ice in the invernal that is return.
You can see the ice cosidential ice -- five years or more, is like the blood that here was like the blood of the body.
In 25 years has been from like that, like this.
This is a problem because the scale of the land of the glacious landscape where there are enormous amount of carbon confront, where there are huge amount of carbon constraight in the microbia.
I respect the totality of the inquinination of global warming, that amount of global warming, that amount of doubling this point of not return.
In a few deep ages in Alaska is already reboiling from water.
The Katey professorse of the University of Alaska was recently with a team lower laughed a team lower last inversus inver.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: Lake is good. The question is if we will be in us.
And a reason is that this is that this termic environment, the Groenland from the north.
This is a glacial record phary.
The laughed never to the levels of the site mill.
This is the Kangerlussuaq, in the soil of the Groenland of the Groenland --
If you want to know how to sale the level of the sea glacier on earth of the sea glacier.
These are going to be increasing very quickly.
Another part of the planet. Agture, the largest block of the planet.
The last month of scientists have delighted that the ice of the ice is in negative, and that Antartide Western -- which is particularly quickly in the subtomine in the skidses.
And there is six feet of water, like in Groenland in Groenland, like Groenland
Sull'Himalaya, the third largest block of ice. You see new laghi, who were selled by the glaciers.
40 percent of the world's population received half the water water from the monkey to the monkey to the monkey
Sulle Ande: this glacier is the source of the water water of this city.
The laughed is increased.
But when it decreates water, the same is going to be water.
In California neve on the Sierra Nevada 40-percent.
The hydrorices are in crisis.
Sprevisions, as you ready, they're gravely.
The growing is a sea world that brings in the world leads to a including inches of incens.
The environment is increasing is increasing a rate out of the normal and without precedently precedents.
Four numbers more numbers in the last 30 years of respect the precedently 75.
This is a whole whole whole of all unsustainable.
If you look at the history context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons, in CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million ton-tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the area of the Pacific, from Americh, in the Americh, and both of the subsidic parts of the subject of the subject of the oceans.
The largest cause, the global warming, with the deforestation, which is 20 percent of the deforestation, which is 20 percent of fossil fuels.
The oil, is a problem, and the carbon is even worse
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions, with China.
And he propond to build a lot of other carbon in the coal carbon on did.
But we're asking to a direction.
These are the projects in the last few years and some evils of the last few years and different proposes.
At every way, there's a political lotta in our country.
The coal industry and oil, they spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon clean clean an oxymore.
And this image reminds me something,
Verunlike the Natral Tennessee, there was a perdity of 3.8 billion pounds of carbon dioxiety scale of carbon did.
Maybe you saw the news there.
This is the second largest flow in America.
It was happening around Natal.
The natalia natalia of the carbon industry.
Video: Frosty the carbonaio is a kind of hallegry.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbonaio is always more and cleaner and cleaner and more cleaner and more cleaner and more cleaner and cleaner.
It's a good price, adorable and the work work are maintains.
Al Gore: From of the West Virginia.
The largest society in the mountain in Massey Coal. This is his friendly friendly.
Video: Don Bllland, Harry Reither -- I'm going to be clear -- Al Gore, Nancy Reid -- not know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clima Proteition has launched two campaigns.
This is a bunch of it, a part.
Video: Attore: At COALergy we see climate changes like a serious serious serious delivering our business.
For this is to invest a big amount of money in a new amount of money in a southern injarian additional and construction truth truth and construction truth and construction truth the coal.
In fact, carbon is not spore.
We think it's cleaned -- has a good profume.
So not preocupathy of climate change
Let me do it.
Video: Attore: Carbone pulled -- you heard a lot of it.
So let's do it a whole structure in a structure of the avancery to how it is.
Straordinary cars are a little rolling rotes; it's the sound of the technology of the clean technology.
The carbon consumer consummition of global warming, but the nieveting technology of the carbon clean that you can see change.
To a eye -- this is the odierman of the fuel of carbon clean of the clean technology.
Al Gore: Infind, the alternative to the economic issues to the economic issue.
Video: Comment: America is in crisi; the national national security crisis, the climate crisis.
The file that lines all the way to everybody, our dependence from fossil fuel and oil, as the fuel oil, as the import.
Now, yeah, there's a new new solution to use.
Rear America: 100-clean energy in 10 years.
A plan to remit America to work, make us secure more secure and help to stop global warming.
And then a solution that basts to solve our problems.
And they go to America. Scover mor.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: Comment: It's about reeating energy to America.
One of the fastest ways to end end end end end to dependence from the fuel to killing our planet.
Comparsa: The future is here. You know, a new energy.
Most 2: Novi investment for places that are good work for the very good jobs.
I said, Rear America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old proverbial old African Eg, "If you want to go speed by sun.
If you want to go far away together."
We have to go far away, speed to the speaker.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED I did a TED introduction on the LHC.
And promises of returning to you on the way to get you to get back to how the machine.
So here I get the same time -- there is no erating, the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment -- 27 miles of circuit -- 27 miles of circumstence.
His the job is to reach the conditions that were present less than a billion in the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
That's just the environment.
This is the machine in the Greene.
We do these min-Big Bang Bang in the retech of the retrouble Bang in the reference.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is 444 meters and a diameter of 2meters
This is an ATLATLAS in built so you can see the proportions.
The 10 sect secember last year we accesen the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immense to control in control.
It's a picture of the first fashion particles that had done all the LHC, entering into collision, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spread particles inside the retech side.
In other words, when we saw that image the 10 secember of the 10 secember of the machine that is a great living.
I don't know if it was this to do more than that, when somebody went to Google and saw that the page was this:
That means that we had a culture of cultural impact over the scientific impact on the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the cultural impact on the way to scientific impact on the scientific impact of the cultural impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the cultural impact of the cultural impact of the cultural impact of the cultural impact of the beyond in the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the cultural impact of the
About a week, there was a problem with the machine, had to these road files here -- these dors.
These films are 13,000 prints when the car works at the masside.
Now, the technicians are going to look at the films and forward "it's not true. It's not true.
And instead they can do it because when they're very fresh to become the superconductors.
So, at least 271 degrees, a ctemperature to the stellow of the stars, these films can bring that current to it.
In one of the junctures in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the films are surrounded by ready, and 13,000 prints suddenly met a electrical resistance resistance of electrics.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive if you think these magneters are more than 20 tons, and that have been smoked, and that are moved about 30 centimeters.
They have about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to leave it, what we did.
We have repristined and trained and trained it.
Now they're coming back back to their underground place underground here.
I end up the end of the march of the march LHC will be new inteam.
And we acceness, and we expect to get the right or himself and continue and continue so our avventure to find out what the morning.
Now, of course, in a quite quest of the way, these accidents reaccendate the debate of science and engineering. It's easy to confuting. It's easy.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the amount of things like LHC.
I want to end with the words of a scientist Inglese, Humphrey Davy, the qual, I guy, in defencies of the experiments of his pupill, and he said, "No is that a lot of money, said, "No is that many for the progress of humans as the report of the human mind that is definitely dangerous for the progress are defining to the ideas that our trionto be completely defines in nature and not new money,
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to get to rethink about how to be a kids, you played cookers.
While you realize how to reach them and grab them and to move them and move them and move it to actually get them to solve problems and so so you can get the space and so so you can get the space relations and space.
The space is deep reasoning is deep connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us.
So, from the inforce of our interaction with physical objects with physical objects with my own Pac, and my Jevan Kalanithi, I started asking -- "And if we use a computer asking, "And if we use a computer computer -- instead of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse to a information with both a information with both of the hand to a information with both a information with both a information with both a computer with both of the sent of the sent of the hand a a computer with both of the hicone-sisisixility of the hicl of the hiconon-hitor of the s'
and we get our pleasure to our pleasure to our pleasure and system?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building Siftle.
In a few words, a Siftable is a whole computer interately as a biscoscoopi.
In a few words, a Siftable is a whole computer interately as a biscoscoopi.
You can move with the hand, they can see it in their hand, they feel between them, feeling their movement and they have a wireless radio wireless radio wireless to it.
But most of course, are physicians as the morning, you can move to the phrandols.
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystems to manipulate information to manipulate information digital information.
And as they become safe safe as a movement, and others, and as they get more physics, and as they become more physics, and as we did, and others, and how we can exploring them new and different pariles of interaction.
He started with some simple example.
This Sift-is configuring video video video -- if you walk it in a direction, the video rotes, if you walk from the other side.
These interactive range are conscious to others.
If they are interested in what they intorous, they are interested in it.
If they get circums, they can get a little bit of a little bit.
If they get circums, they can get a little bit of a little bit.
They also have their movement and including their movement and including it.
And then we realized that one of the interesting interaction was the way to use the common on data, to example a color like a color, as if it was a colory.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as a sell, and I can use them to switch them to the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the clayers in the middle of the color of the color in this case, where
and I can use them to look for the color in the middle of the color in the cent, where they missing it.
If we go out and we can put a little bit of it.
There are also good possibilities of learning, like languages, the mathematics and the logic and the logical gone of the logical things and see the results of the immediately immediately and see the results of the immediately cheasily to be good and see the results of the right things that are the fast and see the results of the fast and see the results of
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacy of Fibonacy program.
Here we have a game of words that is half a half between Scarabeo and Boggle.
And every turnness, every turnners on every Siftable, Pratically, every Siftable, Pratically, every Siftable, and while you try to do words about a dictionaries.
And then about 30 seconds are remissed and you a new set of reading and new possibility to try to try to do it.
Thank you.
Here's what children came to the Middle in Lab, I made it so that they tried them and I went a video video.
They are very liked a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give you a lot of educational things that you don't have to give people a lot of educational things that you don't have to give you a lot of education.
You have to just say, "Compions of word," and they know exactly what to do.
Here's how people who try it.
This is our beta head young head of the youngest tex.
It really wanted to get a multiple plure.
They were only morning, for him.
Now, this is an applation of a cardboard interactive.
We wanted to build a tool, for the learning linguge of the Luoh is Felix.
It can be able to get new characters in the scene, switness.
It can be able to get new characters in the scene, switness.
And that's where you get the sun.
Video: The sole is surge.
David Merrill: Now he brought a treator in the scene.
Video: The treater.
Be work!
So Siftable and saving the close can make the characters --
Video: Bau!
by inventing their own story.
Video: Ho!
DM: It's a story with the open final end, and it can decigs.
DM: It's a story with the open final end, and it can decigs.
Video: Vly -- gatto.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, made of recently to be made of recently to be made of music.
It's a tool, made of recently, to sampling and exeguing music.
Siftable here are act sounds like base, basically, based and bacteria --
Every one of these are four different variations, and you can choose what we use it.
You can inate these sounds in a sequence to your pleasure in your pleasure.
And to make it just touch it a sounds "sequence."
These are actually actually controlling from the living, like the reveral and filter and filter
The attacks to a particular sound and then including them to the stay into the starts to hold it.
And then there are the effects of the time and volume, which are apply to the whole sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We will try to put a basic in two Sift-"sequenc," we go to a serie, the extend of the lower.
Now I put a bunch line.
Video: DM: Now I add percent of the --
Video: And now I'll put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the effect of the live.
Video: DM: I can speak the whole sequence by a late or from the other.
Video: And I'm going to add the filter to the bottom to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombinate the sequence "volouous.
So I don't have to plan earlier, but I can sudden, you know, you get longer or more time.
And now, finally, I can smoking the whole sequence on the left Siftable "volum."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces man-machine is always more like how they work our brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this percord, and also some possibilities that we try to bring out from the lab laboratory.
The concept I want to put is that it's coming to this new generation of the design objects to interact-media digital digital media in the way we want to get information in the way we want to get this new new generation in the way we want to get this new generation of the world that we want to put in this new generation of the world that we want to get this new new generation of the world that we want to get this to transmit with the information in the world.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a writer.
And I want to get books is my profession, but it's more than that, of course, but it's more than that, of course,
It's also love and the love, the hold of my life.
And I don't expect that change.
But that, something particularly happened in my life and in my career, who was a reera, who brought me the whole report with this work.
The particular thing is I was I recently wrote this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Ama," the quality, and whatever ever was a big book, for some reason he used to somehow he used to be a big, sensational.
And the result is that everywhere else else is that you go to me as if I was convicted to me.
It is true -- condanned -- condent -- condent -- condnately -- condanned -- convice.
They are all worried to me and they said, "You don't have a fear of a better way to do better.
You don't have to keep writing for all life without able to be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can import.
that can care anybody?"
It's rassicury, you know.
But it could go worse to the worst of the 20 years ago, when I began to say people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer.
I was in the same reaction based on the same reaction from the land.
And people said, "Don't be able to have successful?
You don't have a fear that the humiliation of the reject kill?
You don't have to do this mestiate for all life without that anything else is ever outside and die on a cumulation of saming spots with the moul of mesting with the mesting clayers of failing hiling with the failing of failing energy,
So, you know, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is "Yes."
I am papering of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also have a lot of other things that people can't be in it.
As the hand other things share are about.
But as I thought about the write what I thought and ask me the last last to be asking me is why is it?
Is it rational?
It's local that anyone has to be spent by a job that you feel feel none of the job that you feel none to do.
But what is there is so much in the impredative to make us nervous health is about the mental health in a way that other character not do that?
As my dad for example, he was a chemical engineer and not remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was afraid to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be able engineer to be able engineer to be able to be engineer if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was to be able to be engineer if he was asked if he
It never was -- that block of the John, how do you go to here?
He didn't work like this, right?
And so, so, chemistry engineers like group have no certainly in the secoliver, and reputation of being alcolized maniacate depressive.
We wrote enough to reputation, and not only writers but creatives of every general, we have this reputation of being enormously instable to be able, and so much as well.
And it's not another that look at the tristage of the magnific death of the minds that creative as a creative minate as a young as a young people and often are young and often hand they are often hand they are often hold them.
And the ones that are not suicide seem to be really, really, they have to their women.
Norman Mailer, before I did, before I did, in the last interview, he killed me a little bit of a very extraordinary extraordinary business of their life.
But we don't drink when we feel about that, because we heard these things that so long as we heard these things that in some way we have completely interiorated and suffering the notion and suffering, and the notion is somehow to be reading and the art, to deal with the angoding.
And the question I want to bring to all of our today is you agree with this ideas?
And it's good to this thing -- because you can look at the one centimeter of the distance to me not for anything about this support supposition.
I think it's odiose.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great minds to live in the real minds
And certainly I know that in my case -- in my situation -- would be very dangerous to start to get that feeling about suppositions, especially the circumstances in my career.
And so -- I think about 40 years. I have about 40 years.
I have still about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely to do that everything write is going to be right now going to be right from the world as the work that was going to be right after my last book.
He slaves, because we're all more or less friends here -- is likely to be the most successful is to my greatest successful --
Oh, Gesus -- who thinking.
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start bing gin the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would have to keep doing this work that we do.
So, the question becomes god, right?
And so I seeds me after a lot of reflecting a way to work on a write costructure of a performan, and to create a perspective, right?
I have to somehow to find a safety distance between me, which I'm writing a little bit about what reaction is written that he was going to be able to look for all the last year. And I was trying to look through the time, trying to find other societies to see how you could have better ideas to see if they could have better ideas to see if they could have better ideas and healthy ideas about how to do it starts to look at the time, and more health ideas
to help people create emotional sent emotional risks of creativity.
And that research took me to the Great and ancient Roome.
And I See because yet in circle and then back back.
In the Great and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity came from human, OK?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit looks at the vine and who came to humans from a few surprising disorder, and unknown away.
The green were called these spirits waters of creativity dians of creativity "demony."
Socrate, wonderful, he believed to have a demone that is a smom that is a distinct of the distinct of the distinct of the distinct of the distinct of the demone that is a demone that is a demone that is a demone that is a demone that is a demone that is a demone that you would have a demone demone to have a demone demone that is a demon
The Romans were of the same idea, but they called that spirit of spirit a genius.
The Romans didn't really really think that a genius was really a genius was a particular intelligenid.
They create a genius was this sort of divine entity that was actually actually in the muri studio in the study of an artist, a little bit like the elfo Dobby, and who was assisted to hidden the work of the artist and modeling the results of that work.
And there is a -- exist, that is the distance of what park costructure, which is the distance of the results of your work.
And everybody knew that was so that it worked, right?
So the antic artists were protold, as a certain narcises, as you know, for example the too narcises, right?
If your work was exceptional hectal you couldn't get the mergely to get the deep that was helped by this geniincorporey.
If your work fail, it wasn't all the whole bony, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a skill.
And so people han concept the creativity in the Ocker for a lot of time.
And then the Rasce came and everything changed and changed this great ideas, we put the human beings and the mysteries without the middle and the mysteries and the mysteries and more without the details of device.
This was the principle of the humanth rational and people began to think that creativity was completely completely divided by the idividing ified.
And for the first time in history, you start to reference this artist as a kind of a genius rather than a person with a genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big mistake mistake.
I think I can afford someone, a simple person to believe being as a recipient as a recipe as a recipe and the surprising mysterious mysterious and etheror too much too much to give to the fragile that human.
It's like to ask someone to ingoid someone to ingoid the sun.
It deform and creates the whole ego and creates all these ingestiable ingestyle expectancy.
And I think this pressure was this pressure that we have to destroyed the artists in the past.
And if this is true, and I think the question is, the question becomes up, and ear?
Can we do it different?
And you get back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery creative.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't get 500 years of rational thinking in a talk about 18 minutes.
And probably people in the audience that would be a lot of scientific suspects on the notion of the notion -- you get people to get the next fasking of their projects.
You probably don't have to convince you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to bring is -- why now?
Why don't you think about this in the way?
Because it has more sense of everything that has ever heard to explain the asperformance of creative process.
And one process that has ever tried to do something -- so, all of this -- so, all here -- yeah, not really, it's rational.
And in fact, it can be completely paranormal.
I did this meeting recently with the Ruth poet Ruth Stone, who has now 90 years, but it was a few years old, but he was a little bit of a poet-old in the Virginia, working out in the welse's wing out in the wall, when a poetry was from the landscape.
He said it was like a fragorous training of air.
And he came to roll out of her landscape.
It was going to feel that because it was going to get the land under his feet.
He knew it was one thing to do to that point and he was to do that, "current to make it as a morn."
And it was going to go home and was indicated by this poem, and he wouldn't have to take a piece of paper and a matters pretty quickly enough, as the training and the training it on the page.
Sometimes he couldn't be enough to be as quickly, so correcent and the correcent and the roll was going to get home and the roll was and she would be able to roll and she was going to be rotoling through the landscape -- as he said, "another poet."
And then there was the time -- this is not going to forget -- there were moments in which the time was almost lost lost lost hot, right?
So, she was going to go home and she was looking for card and he was going through a death in the wasting in the way that was passing, and then he said she was as if you hit with the other hand off.
She was offered the poem from the coda and he released her in his body and translate it on the page.
And in these cases, the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and intacted, but the word at the last word at the last word of the last word of the word at the first word at the first word at the last word of the last word at the first word of the first word at the first word at the first word of the first word of the last word of the first word at the first word of the first first time.
So when I felt about -- it's fearth is exactly huge, it's equally huge,
I don't have my creative process -- I'm not a conduct!
I'm a mul, and my way to work is -- wake up to the same orary every day and go to work and go over and go over and go over and go over and go over and go over and go over and go over the same time.
But even I was in my head in my head and tuned against that thing, in my head of the way, and you were laughed.
And I guess many of you have a lot of you have.
You know, even though the work and ideas were told me from a certain source source source I couldn't honestly know.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to it in a way to not lose the head, but pluttoster, but we do do it remain?
And as I really, the best example of me contemporary example that I have is the musician musician -- which I interviewed a few years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life was the incarnation of the artist in the artist of the artist -- to control these species of creatives to control these kind of creatives of totally interiorate species of interiors.
But then you get up, and a day when she was driving on a day in Los Angeles, changed everything for him.
She was going to be handed and all a little bit of a melodia, which comes in his head as it makes the inspiration, which comes in his head as it makes it -- you want, you know, it's wonderful, and the wish, you know, it's not as to take it.
It has no main card, it doesn't have a matter, it has no record record.
So it starts to feel this kind of old anxiety to him very few of the anxiety doing, "I'm going to lost obsessed by this very very good at this song.
I didn't get enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to go to the panic stopped it.
And it was the whole process and made something of new way.
And he just watched the sky, and said, "cus," not see I'm driving that?"
"Who seems to be write a song hang ther?
If you really want to exist, you go back to a moment when I can take care of you.
Other to importance someone else today's to get someone else todays.
I went to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his work changed after that.
Not the work, the work was even dark as a seed.
But the process that was releasing him that was released when he preached the genius, the genius out of the genius was going to be in the way that problems and fresh and free it to be something that was not a whole thing.
but it has this peculiar bizard, wonderful bizarre a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that was not Tom.
So how to feel that story started to change a little bit how to change a little bit that I was working and already saved me a time.
This idea, saved me when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Amaa," and falling in one of the disperation where we all all when we are working on something and we can't start to think it's going to be a desaster book is going to be the worst book book ever write.
Not only bad at the worst book write.
And I began to think about throw this project.
But then I remember Tom talked to the air and try and try and try it.
So I got my face in the hold from the hands of the hands to a hold corner.
And I said, "You know, what you say, "You know, you know if this book is not going to be brilliant not going to be the miles, right?
Because as you see I'm going to be putting everything I haven't got more than that.
So if you want to get it to you and do your parts.
Okay. But if you don't do it, you know what I don't get it to be anything.
I'm going to go to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to do for the record that I was going to do my part," because -- at the end is at the end of the North Africa Africa --
And they were always magnificent, because the ballers were professionals, and they were fantastic professionals.
But every tant, I would make something happen, and one of these artists became actually translate --
And I know what I talk about, because I know you can see it all of a point, a performance way.
It was like the time is stopped and the ballery walked through a kind of lapse and was not a different from the sun, as the 1,000 nigh, but everything is releasing it.
And suddenly not only as a human.
But you accepty from divince and under the device.
And when this next time, this next time, people knew what he was was, people knew what he was going to was, they call her her name.
They had the hands and began to cant, "Allah, God God, God God, God God, God God, God, God, God God, God God, Allah, God God, Allah, God God, Allah, God God, Allah, God God, Allah, God God, Allah, God God, Allah, God God, Allah, God God, Allah, God God, Allah, God God, Allah, God God, Allahh, God God, Allah,
That's God, you know,
And there was a story, when the More More the Spapay of Spapay -- they were to prey this habitude and the ready one changed in the century of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, he was going to be in the famenic corries or in the famenic.
In Spay, when a artist has made something impossible and magic -- "At it, you know, you know, you can get a fast of God.
And it's great, because we need.
But the problem comes the next day later, for the dballery, when you wake up and discovering that are 11 in the Martedges and last of God is not more.
It's just a death with a great male with a male with a male of male in the key altea.
And maybe nobody will give the name of God still while yet, and what has to do with the rest of his life?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to do in a creative life.
But perhaps it has to be so angotising, if you can not believe that, as the most extraordinary as you were the most extraordinary of your being being being from you to be so angod.
But it creates you just get to the unbelievable of this team of the founds of this team that is going to go to someone else when you have.
And you know, if we think in this whole change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's certainly as I thought for several months during the work that was a number of a book that was very successful following the very successful cheap of my great.
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electried to be on this is, not have fold.
Not just just your work.
It is going to present your parts, any of your parts, any can be.
If your work is dance, bally.
If the devine, I assigned a little bit of a decision to leave some kind of wonderful for a few kind of wonderful time through your sforeign your own sforet; then "O!"
Other and do the same as your dance.
And "Oh, you're going to yourself.
I think I should be a lot of teaching it.
"Yes!" And the same one for the human and heads and testing the tunes from the tunes to be depresent to depresent to be going to be continuously presenting for the human and head.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Oh, yea!
As you know I've already talked about some of these projects on human, on what can mean, and what can mean, and the discovery new genes.
Now we're starting a new percorso: we started to digitalize biology and now starting from that digital code we are in a new fasking and synthetizing life.
We always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is the life?" is something that many biological are trying to understand a levels.
We tried a different approach, reducing the minimes to minime to minimplements.
We're digitalizing for almost 20 years ormas.
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the world from the biology world of biology to the digital world.
Now we ask ourselves, can we regenerate life, or create new life from this digital universe to this digital universe to digital life from this digital universe to this digital universe as a digital universe to the digital life from this digital universe to the digital life.
This is the map of a organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from the genome of the most small between those that can authorate in the laboratory.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one more smaller than one of the little bit of it.
We can get a hundred to heliminate a hundred of genes about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the metabolic map to the name of the nostring nostry.
It creates, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate -- it's very unlikely to be able to bring a cell.
So we decided that the only way to progrey this way to be synthetizing this chromosomes to make the components to get the components to bring the fingers to some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the avventure of the "Can we can synthetize a chromost?"
Can you can make these great molecules that we never had to make these great molecules that never could create before earlier.
And in case of business business -- can we make a chromother?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemistry of the inert material.
The speed that we can digitalize life is growing to be growing up to exponential exponential to exponential exponential is to be able to digitalize the life is growing to be able to get exponential exponential exponential to rely exponential to rely the life is growing to reach the
Our capacity to write the genetic code, invest progressislently, but it's improving.
And our most recently results, the brings on a curve.
We started 15 years ago.
The process required a lot of past again with a bioetic review, before we start the first experiments.
But we found out that synthetize DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that are small-of-DNA century cheap of 30 to 50 letters and it's a degenerative proces: the most mistakes.
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these frames and reach the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt to start to start from Phi digital information of the HPhi X 174.
It's a little virus that kills kills kills kills kills.
We have the framments, effective rewards the reeffort and a molecules of DNA of about about 5,000 letters.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemistry chemistry and we put it into the bacteria started reading this genetic and degree the particles began to read this genetic and producing particles in the virals.
The particles are then released by the cell phone, are coming back and they have destroy the E.
I talked about recent members of the petrolexing industry said that they were certainly understood this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the larger things in the larger
We wanted to build the entire chromosome.
It's more than 580 mile bedded genetic code.
So we thought we could build it in the scale of the virus, so that we can change the survey for what the components are the vivent.
The design is crucial and if we start with digital information into a computer, these must be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the standard accurategy for every 10 mile of a mistake for every 10 mile of the mistake.
We have discovered, 30 mistake -- 30 mistake errors. If we used that original sequence we never had to be able to do it work.
A part of the process is designing segment segment that are overwhelming with all other segments to 50 letters to build underunit to build underunit smaller than the working working together.
We try to try to do one here.
You probably have a little that we put the river.
Think of this is: We have a genetic code on four letters: A, C, Go and T.
Three of those letters together codifice about 20 adminiminioid and there's a specific order to every administry administry for every adminimal administry of reading for every administry adminious administry to the military of the letters of the layers and they have a specific order to be with 20
So we can use genetic code to write words, fraying, thinking about it, fraying, thinking.
What we did in the beginning was authography.
Some have been dolphuses from the fact that it was not a poemy.
We have designed these segments to just put them with meeting.
There are enzyme that repaid and they put them asypple.
And we started assembling the parts, starting with five to seven milletter and letter ones, uniting the letter to 14 millys' united to 72 letter to get to 72,000 letters.
And every past we made these segments in the abundance to sequence them that we are trying to create a very robate proceing to create a very robute -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems like the tabellone of the baskets.
When we get these segments to these very long segments, more than 100 mile in E.
You get to the limits of the modern molecule.
So we looked at other mechannel.
We knew another mechanism called a Hechannelism recombination that in biology is useful to repair DNA in a check of the DNA in the segments.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiohard ans, it can absorb three million radiation.
You can see the sound square the srow as a chroad is destroyed.
In 12 hours -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly how it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be able to touch complete completely.
They can live under empty.
I'm absolutely sure life life is in space, and you smoking new rich environments of water.
And in the real way, NASA showed that this avail.
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes -- just using the lights of the design segments to inserious chors.
The lights resembate them automatically.
This image was not taken with a electric microscope with a microscope to a regulate.
It's a molecule that we can see it with a microscope slightly read it.
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago.
It's more than 58,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the largest of a definitely structure ever created by the man.
It has a lot of 300 million.
If we stay with a 10 paper without spaces, they would like 142 pages only to get this genetic code.
Now, how do we do that? How can we activate it?
Of course, you get a virus is a game from a guy who are a game from the girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria with back.
It's simpler even when it's eucariote as a our-cells as a nuclear and inserirl, which is basically the process of cloning.
In the bacteria the chromosome is instead of integrated in the cell phone, but we have recently demonstrate that we can do a birthday of a cell chromosome,
We purified a tailing romosometimes from a microbial species of microbial mosome.
The two are different as the people from topis.
We added a few gene more in the way that we can decide what to chromost.
And it has the hold with the enzyme with the proteins.
And when we put it in the cells was stupend -- and you open our graphic despite our graphy -- the new chromosome, he went inside the cell phone.
And we were actually thinking that we couldn't go there, but we tried to get it in the way to get it more than that.
This is one of the major mechanism of evolution.
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third chromosomes somewhere, I add in a second thousands of new trates.
So who think about evolution as a only gene to evolution that you have no understanding of biology.
There are no enzymes called restriping is that adrirights digest DNA.
The chromosome that was in the cell is not a one.
The cell phon-tail-tails that we inserito's ha.
And it reside, and he recognized the other chromosomes as a death material as a mosome, and we were return. And we return with only the cells and the new chromosome.
It became blue because of the genes that we have inserved.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a sort of gone is going to lost in a new species, based on the new software that we delipped in the cell phone.
All the protein has changed, membranes are changed, and when we read genetic code is exactly what we have transfed.
Now, this may seem to genetic alchemy, but altering the software DNA in a enough enough to be able to make things in a pretty replace.
Now, I explain that there is not about genesis -- but progress of progress from three million and a half million evolution, and I said that, maybe we're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explan.
Why do I do that?
I think it's quite obvious enough when we think of our necessity.
We're going to go from six billion people to nine years in the next 40 years.
Just to give you an example of the nice in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existing in 1946; in 40 years, there will be four years, there will be four years, there will be four years, there will be four to be four to be quack.
We're having trouble now now to find food, water and clean and clean drug for six billion and a half billion people.
It's going to be even harder to do it for nine billion.
We use more than five billion coal of carbon dioxiety of coolies.
That means millions of barils a day.
When we try to find biological processes or whatever these process to report these process to report these these process to get a huge challenge to me.
And the whole thing we have to have to get the whole CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere.
At the day because of the scientific discoveries that in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are designed for the future.
The electronic industry is only a dozen of component, and think about how many different things are coming out.
Our limits here are the biological data from biological reality, and our imagination.
Now we have techniques that because of these symmetos, in the symptetization, in a can create what we call combinatory generator.
We can build a big robot, which can produce a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
Think about these 20 million different genes or to try to optimize the processes to produce either either drugs or drugs, we can change through a little theam, and create more biology biology and create more biology than in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a selection selection.
We can choose for chance to survive, chemistry or carbon dioxietc.
This is a few software programs of a few software programs that we're working to be able to sit and design species to be able to sit and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't necessarily know how they will do.
We know exactly what their genetic code.
Now we're focusing on fourth of quarter-generation.
You also saw you get hour ethanol was a mouthanol was a mouth-hanol experiment.
We have a carbon on on the third generation that will use enough to be prazing the higher of the highest value as the either either than the either of the water or different types of throw or different kinds of thrown to the higher than the either.
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increase the cost of food and limiting the cost of food and availability to be transforming the CO2 in material that we are working to design cells that can get this purposed, and we can have to be able to be able to have this purpose of a fourth generation in about 18 months.
The light combined with CO2 is a metodox -- but in our discoveries in our discoveries in the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
And it is in the ocean ocean is about 2,500 feet of the water.
They create meter from CO2 to using hydrogen molecular source as a source of energy source like this.
We're trying to figure out if we can get CO2, which can easily be transportated by the CO2 in carbon in carbon in carbon in carbon in carbon and drive this process.
So short we think we can be able to increase what the question of "What is the basic question of what the life." We have the reason to remic industry. We have the reason to remic the petrochemicals.
Yeah, if you can't do it from TED, where you can, where you can?
It would be a main source source of energy.
And so, so, we're working for using the same metoes to create vaccines to create vaccines to create vaccines
You saw this year with the influence, we're always behind a year and a dollar dollar in less when it's about the right vaccine.
I think what you can change is going to make a combinable vaccines in antibodies in antibodies in anticipy.
And that's how the future could start to be changing, accelerate the tree of evolution, accelerating the evolution with synthetic bacteria and then then then the eucarian eucaria.
We are so so much from the improving people.
Our purpose is to do it in a way of living enough to try to do a lot of it. Thank you very much.
First of all I will see the fastest possible possible for the most fundamental job, a new new technology that we took to Microsoft in following water, a year ago that's Seadgone.
It's a environment, where you can interact is in the local level that remote with an enormous amount of visual data here.
Here we are seeing a lot of gigabyte photos with a kind of zoom costing and continue, for a speed bread -- aving the images like we want it.
And not matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big the amount of information that we see, how big these data is the images.
Most is a digital photographs, but this is a provide from the Big Big Library of Congresss, and reenter in the legal leg, 300 megapixel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time. It's also a very flexible architecture in any time. It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a whole book of data doesn't image.
This is Dickens. Every unce Casa chapter of Dickens.
And to tell you that it's just testing to tell you that is not imagination, we can do something like that, to get a real representation of the head, not a picture.
It could be a little artificial to read a electronic book to read an electronic book book.
Not the advision of it.
This is a more realistic example of the number of Guardian.
Every image is the beginning of a seation.
And it really gives you the pleasure of the experience of reading the version of a magazine or a filled filled a fix of a fix.
We also did something with the corner of this number in particularly of this particular Guardian.
We created a fashion advertising advertising -- much more than the one that is used in a normal commercial advertises. We insert content ent content ent ent content.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific folks or even specific with techniques.
And this really shows some of these ideas to get the limits of space on the screen of space on the screen.
And we hope this lemploy to put a few of these are a few of these are similar to be necessary.
But of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And on this isn't going to lose time, if we don't want to say that we have contributute to give it a lot of the field.
These are all the streets in the United States in the U.N.
So now we're going to go to something else.
This is actually from the vision of the web; you can go to see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which fight two different technologies.
A is Seadragon and the other is a visual visual computer visual computers from Noah Snavely, a student of the University of Washington, with Steve Seitz of the UWashington, with the Washingtarian of Microsoft Szeliski Microsoft Research.
And it's from the vision on the Web, managed by Seadrage.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen -- where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of delivering with multiple experience of it.
But the space collotic collapse of the images here has actually a meaning.
The slump of the computer have recorded these images together, so that they have to be able to reach the remove to the real places that are all the spaces that are close to the reach to the South Western Roccians -- they were taken -- there are some of a degrees of a slide-show de-show slide-show --
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot of space.
I want to go directly to one of the Noah-- and this is from a precedent of Photosynthize -- that we have done for the first time -- to show you what I think is really the key -- to show you what I think is really the key Photosynthosynthosynthum. And it's not necessary so evidence that we put in the website.
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of Notre-Sech images from Flickr. Basta digital Flickr. Basta Flickr. Basta Flickr and you get images of types and so forth. Every one of these boundaries represents a image that is discovered it looks like this model.
So they're all images by Flickr and have all been connected to space space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never end up to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratification to get this kind of acveling here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of framework in the framework in the SLR, a number meaning number meaning, it set in this environment.
And if you can try to find those most strange things that are going to try to get those most strange people in it.
Many are block by factors, etc.
Some of the photography is a series of photography -- excold.
This is a poster poster of Notreally.
We can go from the physical view.
The essential point is that we can do with social environment. This is now taking things from the social inter-memory inter, from the collective inter, from the visual perspective.
All those photo become connected together, greater than the sum of the parts.
You have a model of the land of the land that emerges.
Think about this as a program of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual Teep Earth virtual
It's something that grows in complexity as people who use it and the people who are using it for the use.
Their photos are metheting from other people.
If somebody comes the idea of contrast to all these sants say to the name, my photo of Notre's catttedral. And the Dame suddenly is to get the whole thing to be doing this -- and I can use the photo in the space that space in that space, in that way, and having a social experience of a different experience of the type of the type of red and red the experience of the red red red by the type of red --
But of course, a consequence of all of this is extremely elaborated by every interesting part of the earth, you don't only see the airplane and the satellite images and satellitary images and sexual memory and sea few of collective things in the collective part.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized the beneficial for what your software will have to do is that at a point, in the next years, all the photography of the world or will be in the world or will be connected?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing is doing basically is discovering.
It's creating hyperlink if you want to do hyperlink, if you want to do the images.
And it's doing it in the bottom of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the rich of seeding information that many of these images can be be used.
As a picture of the web, you know, a phrase and the head on the page, web has a lot of information about the picture.
Now, what happens if that photo all your picture?
So the amount of interconnectedness and the amount of rich interconnections that is really enormous classical s; it's a classic effect. It's a classic effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the pleasure when you travels and one of the inngraphic search is the way to live in who has been able to live in the middle of the past, the passed in the wind, the past, the gate in the wind, touch in the today's ged in today's leaving today, the pleter.
Basti to think that the monkeys Jaguar travel, and the idea that the money. And the mitughters are still a lot of meaning or that in Himalaya, the budying are still the construction of the Dhar, to remember the importance of the importance of the world -- but the idea that the world in fact, but it's just a model of reality, but it's just a model of reality, but it's just a model of reality, but it's a model of reality,
The consequence of a particular set of adaptation that our stirses made of adapt that our stirts has done, a lot of generations ago.
And of course, we all share the essential tracts.
We all hidden we all hidden we all hidden we all hidden we all hidden we all hidden we all hidden it.
We are subjects to start to start with.
We have to deal with the inesorability to death ourselves and whales --
We all have a art.
What it is the particular rhythm of the canzone, the race of every culture.
Not matter that are the Penan of the forest, or the follower of the Borneo, or Haiti, or the Haiti, the Curanderriors of the Kenya secentries of the Curander's Churander's heart in the heart of the Sahara.
He was my own company of the journey in the desert a month ago, or a yak of the Heep in the Qomolanger -- about Everest, the mother of the world.
All of these people teach us that there are other ways to exist other ways to think about existing in the world.
And if you reflect a time, it's a concept that can give you hope.
Inside, the miriades of the world creating a spiritual and cultural and cultural that has the planet and cultural is important for the benefit of the planet as a biokay, as a biospheras as a biosphery.
And you can think about this cultural ragning cultural as a ethnospher's total redefining the ethnos-fast of all the concepts, mitting intuitions that are brought in the human imagination from the human imagination to the human imagination from the alba imagination of the consciousness of the conscious conscious conscious concepts, you can call it the whole concept,
The ethnosfast of humanity.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how much inquisities.
And because biosphery was gravitely consumed as a biosphery and unfortune too faster.
No biology, for example, it would say that 50 percent of all the species was or is on the earth of the summer -- in the extreme -- in the pockey -- in the most optimistic field -- in the biological diversity -- and you don't have near the most optimistic -- that of cultural diversity -- that diversity of cultural diversity -- that of cultural diversity --
The indicate of all of the language is the language of language.
When you're born 6,000 languages on this planet.
A language is not only compost by a vocabulary rules or a series of gragragramatical rules.
A language is the price of the spirit of human spirit is the human spirit of the human spirit is the price of the spirit of the human spirit is the human spirit of the human spirit is the price of the human spirit of the human spirit is the price of the spirit of the human spirit is the price of the human spirit is the human spirit of the human spirit is the human spirit of the human spirit of the human
It's the middle that animates every culture in the world is in the material.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a smoking, a thinking of spiritual possibilities.
And those 6,000 langues, while we were sitting in Monterey, at least half it is not more sussurrying in the ears.
They don't get the kids, the kids, the kids, the one is not a lot of something that is already dead.
What is there is more tristage of being the silence of being the last to talk a language, the fact that we have no way to transmit the soul of avian addition of the children, or of the children?
This is a fed of someone in the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks a few weeks a little bit of a world -- every two weeks of a language of an ancient language.
And I know someone to say "Is it not the best way?
The world would not be a better place if we were all the same language?" Benism, we talk all yoruba. Parlik we all yoruba. Let's talk a cant.
We talk about kogis.
You will be going to be a tract thing that means that you can't talk to be talking to language.
I would like to do a journey through the ethnosferaking through --
a little journey in the ethnosphery of what we're perdening it.
Many of us forget that when I say, "different ways of existing existing different ways of existing existing different ways of existing existing in the existing of us that when I say, "different ways of existing existing very different ways of existing existing in the exist.
We take the Barasana, in the Barasana, in Amazonia secentriony, the popular of the anaconto come from the flip of the lasty of the last, the popular sacries.
It's a population that is not able to distinguish the blue color because the blue color is identified in the forest, which depends the population.
They have a strange language and a rule rule rule -- "Hylanguages, you have to get a person to be a different language.
And all of that has roots in the past, yet the particular family is that in these extreme in the extreme six or seven lings, no one language of the mysteries in the mysterious language.
They are limited to listen and then start to talk about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived -- the Waorani of Ecuador nordal, an incredible popular popular EC, who had the first contats in 1958.
In 1957 mission has tried to have a fact-made a mistake factly.
They made them out of the high-dimensions that they thought about a few who reported love, and forgeting that this popular forest, they had never seen anything about bi-dimensional rainforest.
They picked up the photo the ground of a form or a shape or a shape or a figar and they killed the figone that was going to be treatment, and they killed five mission with the laws.
But the Waorans didn't have only to stranimal stranimal to do stranimal --
They killed between each other.
Fourth percent of death was caused to their own state.
We have been reached to eight generations and we found two natural death cases and when we put it for saper, they put one of them was again that death that death that is death aging, and then they killed him himself.
The cuts were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the first '80s was assigned a really folding when my professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to be in the basis of the basis of Duval and Tonton Macoutes, and the Tonton Macoutes, and imposing the velened for the zombies.
To make a sense of miraculture I would have to have to understand Vooun and that Voou is not a black hasn't black in the mirace.
It's pretty a metaphor a metaphor of the world.
Many interesting.
If you ask me to tell me the great religions of the world, what would I say to do with it?
Christianity, Islam, Buddismo, Ebraism, etc.
A continent is always leaving, thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no fashion -- not folding and Voodoo and Voodoo is not the distilled of these religious religious religious religious religious religious faces of the slavery of the slavery of the slavery has been leaving to the slavery of the back.
What makes it interesting is makes your voodoor is the intriguing between life and death and death you.
So you saw the spirits.
The spirits can be invaded by Grande Aqua, they respond to the dance of dance and they replaced themselves, they replaced themselves, the following way to be the following becomes the following becomes the following becomes the following becomes the following becomes the die.
So this voodooisters to say, "You want to go to close to talk about God.

And from the moment that you are possing, is the spirit that drives you, how can you do anything about the mal?

And in all the populations that I lived the most extraordinary Kogi of Sierra Nevade Santa Marcky Santa Marckles.
And the vulcanic civilization that once lived on the careers of Colombia in the conquist, the population of the conquist, the population of the vulcanic market that you can see on the career.
In a drug continent -- this population never been conquisted by the spagnot.
And there are governed by a clack of a clack but their shape is decided.
The young following are being taken by the family to three or four years, and live secreated in a world of good and homberry in a world of the feter of the glaciers for 18 years.
Two period of nine years of proposing for reducing the nine months of management that translate in the user of the mother, now are metaphor of the user of the Madre.
For all of this time, they get accultured to the values of their society, values that they previous pricing their prayers and only construction -- or cosmic balance.
At the end of this incredible starting, they suddenly lead to the first time in life of 18 years, they see a treatment of the first ba. And in that activity of the first balls -- when the sun smoking, all that they learned in the smoke is a conference of the beautiful landscape -- it's a conference of a speaking behind and says, "The prete -- and the previous pathy behind it and say, "Dap a past of this --
"Well I want to you.
It's stupend. Now it's not to be protected.
They call the greatest brothers and say that we we, threats are the hospitals of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think about Indias we think about the Rousseau Rousseau and the old story of the noble noble noble concept in his simplicity or maybe we can see Thoreau and say these popular popular popular Well and we say, these popular popular people are close to the Earth of us.
The Indian population is not the unvehicle from our own own nastic factory from our algia.
There is no space for these things in the malarian Asmat the gelic vents of Tibet, but because of time and rerituals have created a mystic of the Earth not about the concept of the same as a subtle as well as a subtle as well underunderunderunderunderunderunderunderunderunderunderunderunderneath the consciousness that the Earth can only be in the human consciousness to the human consciousness
What does it mean to that?
It means that a young girl of the Ande that is growing that mountain is a spirit that is a spirit that will be a deep human right, and it will have a deep relationship with the mountain or that respect with the mountain or that place in the World War is a massive deep that is a massive mong of rocks that is a massive amount of rocks of rocks to be a massive rock of rocks to be scale of rock of rock
Which is the death of a spirit or a mineral is irrieving.
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and natural world.
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannica creating that the forests evening to be cut.
And this has rejected a human being being in my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the Hukukukuk and the drink the stage of the world and the drinking cannibal extra sedly that we deal with the Hamatsa.
If you start to look at that these culture can create different reality, you can start to start to understand some of their sensitive discovery.
I took this picture to aprile in the nordoctor.
Maybe some of you have heard of the ayahuase, the most powerful support psychoptie of the repertower repertoo.
What makes it fascinating the ayahuas's not potential with the potential to make a chemicals. It's composite by two elements.
And then a land, this lian leander that has a series of beta-carboline, harmine and harghrows, law launchogens.
And I take the only plants a bluewing out a little bit of conscience, but it's measured with the leaves of coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee.
This plants powerful with triptamines, very similar to the evoxyltryptamine-5, methoxyltryltryltryptaminines.
If you ever see Yanomami Yanomami to the hidden that they do from a different set of species, anchchoxyltryltryltryltryltrypting.
Tiring that pole on the hidden is a little bit like being shooted by a smoke of barocks and landing on a sea sea of electricity. It doesn't believe a distortion of the reality of reality, really, creates the reality of reality.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who has taken the psychchchchopen, with her psychchchogens in the 1930s in Mexico.
Second my text is not to classifix these triptamines because if you're made not telling any of being hallucined.
You can get the orally only if you have a few things that denize with other substances that denize the MAO.
Now is the beauty beta-carboline that are inbrought in this lian inbunch of the same kind of necessary triptamines. The question is a very powerful four 80,000 species of plants, how these people are going to find two death death two death death -- but if you combine in this way, way, they think if you combine in this way, but if you combine in this way, but if you combine in this parts of the part?
We use the great euphemisism of proof of the proof the mistake that can reveal infrut.
But if we ask Indians, they will tell us "Looking at the plants talking."
What does it mean to that?
This tribe, the Cofan, has 17 variety of illahuash -- that distinguish nettely in the forest, and our eyes would come into the same species.
If we ask him how they are asking their pockey tells us "Thereereereas I was not know? I said, "No."
The solution is, you get 17 variety in a night of a pion a folks and each one dog with a different different way.
And so we don't have this is a at Harvard, but it's a lot more interesting to count the stams.
Now, the problem is that also the ones of us who also have the ones of us who have the kids who have the Indian popular painting but somehow to the sea history of the sea history of the respect to our real real world.
In fact, the XX century, 300 years, it will not be reminated for his wars or its technological innovations that but rather how the was where we stopped and we have abbracing and we embraced a passively destruction of the mass of biological diversity and cultural of the planet. Now it's not change.
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians have no way to be Sioux when they put from the horse and fresh and fresh as a hurd and fresh and calculation and calculations.
It's not the change or technology that threatening the ethnosfer. It's the power.
The domination.
And if you give a look at the world, you'll find these are not the destiny cultures are not destiny culture.
They are living creatures and dynamics out of the existence from forces to identify and adapting.
And I'm sorry to disbodies in the pathric of Penans,
a popular nake of Sarawak, in the Sarasiatic -- a popular popular the forest, to a generation ago, and now reduced to the next generation of the reducing reef, where you can see the river, where you can see the rivers from the book, which looks like a half a lot of the way to the Meria Chinese Meridigging Chinese haps the Japanese illuminate the Japanese and the Japanese death Cinese illuminate the Japanese horize,
It takes the stage with the subtracks with the subtract to the forest.
Or, in the case of Yanomami, are the disease that came to the earth of the gold.
If we move on the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of searching searching search, you can see the last volume.
As you know the genocide -- the extraction of a popular population, but the inner destruction of a popular level, but the destruction of a population, not only conditions, but celebrated in certain environments, because it makes part part of the strategic of development.
And you can't understand the suffering of Tibet until you start to start to the beginning.
I lost the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China in the Western Cina in the Western Tibet with a young colleague, but only came to Lhasa young colleagues that we felt about it.
6,000 monuments sacred in poles and clawing and energy.
1.2 million people killed by the Cultural Rivolution in Cultural.
The dad of this guy was ascritical to Panchen Lama.
The one means that it was killed to be killed to the Chinese Turch.
The guy was the Sua Santity in the diaspora that led to the popular in Nepal.
His mother was imprisoned and her her colper was rich to be red.
It was brought to hidden the age of two years on the age of two years from his gonna because it couldn't live without him.
The surprise -- which has done the same thing was multimately in reedue.
A day he inavailed a fashion the Mao -- it was going to get a fashion and it was put in the work forced for seven years.
Tibet of Tibet can be inexpecially inner the spirit of the popular is from ten.
At the end of the end, all you get a choice.
We want to live in the world of the monotony world or we want to collect the policy world of diversity?
The big Margaret Mead, before we die said that his greatest fear that his greatest fear that was that, in our own vision of the world, not only will see the legal legs of human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination -- but a day we wake us from a dimentor dimentor a dimentor dimentmentor dimenticing from a dimental dimentor dimentict of the human images.
And it's humiliating our species to reminate our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neoliter's Revolution that has given us agriculture, which has made us to be able to be the seed-based culture, res, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern world industrialized has 300 years.
That is a story I don't suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with a thousand to the millenior to come to the millennia.
When these cultures of the world is asked what to be human, they respond to be human, respond to be human, respond to us to be human, respond to us to be human, respond to be human, they respond to be human, they respond to be human, respond to to be human, respond to to be human, they respond to be human, respond to be human, respond to be human,
And it's in these answers that we all have to be what we are. We are all risking -- a kind of conscious conscious amount of people can fire the gifts and the giving the gifts can fire of the good moments.
I took this picture on the north north of Baffin, when I went to the whales of the Inuit, and this man -- Olayer, he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather's wonderful story of his grandfather's grandfather's wonderful story of his grandfather's existed in his grandfather's extremely history.
The dog government was not always gentlense with the Inuit and the '50s for the 1950s for the 1950s to be able to be able to be able to be able to colonies.
The grandfather of this man referred to go to the way.
The family for his life, and he took all of his own own and all of his attributes, and all of his attributs.
You have to know that Inuit doesn't get the fresh that they are defitting it.
The slits of the slittles were made of fishing caribt in the skin in caribs.
The grandfather of this man didn't have to be in the night or night or the bathism that suffering.
It's sleeping the pananolyland, you know, panchalongside and defected in their own hand. When the other hand, and they did make a lam.
It spruzed up on the points of this caccepts and when they came solid -- killed a son.
He brought the dog and created a brill, with the tears cassets has created a slittle, he imbrilled a gun, and he has disappeared on the banking, besting of caccepted in the jum.
We want to talk about horse? [Ris] And that, in different ways, Applausian is the symboll of the Inuit and the Inuit and the Inuit and all the Indian population of the world.
In the 19190s 1999 government canadese has rejected to the Inuit has releasing the larger of California and Texas a mate territory and the Texas a mous.
It's their new pathrie. It's called Nunavut.
It's a Indian therefore territories. They get all the mineraries.
One of the plendid, example of how a national national can recognize with his populo.
And finally, I think it's pretty obvious about who who was in these remote areas of the planet, it realized that they're not remote that they are not remote to be in the remote that they don't have any remote that they are not remote that they are not remote to the world that are not remote to the remote of the world that are not remote to the remote of the planet,
For someone is home.
They represent select the human imagination that are rising at the tree of the time -- the same, the same, as the southers, as the southern as a geography of hope.
And we end up to the National Geographic we are convinced that politicians never go to swim anything.
We believe the polemicy --
[Applausive, not even though we believe that the stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best institution, and maybe we are the best institutions to tell the stories of the world. And we have 35 million visites.
156 countries transmitted our television canal.
Our magazines are reading from millions of people.
Our work is traveling in the etnosphers' places that are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to find the reveal reveal in diversity, and we have to find a styeap styeah. And we have to find a styellow life in a world of plural and multicultural world in a plural and the multiple of the world
where the saggeity of all the popular can contribute to our benefit to our benefits.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope to call other than you have heard and I'll be provided some other connections, in case not borders.
I want to start with what I call "the official dogma official."
The dog's official official of what?
The dogma official society of all the industrial societial societies, "If we want to massizing the benefit of our citizens," "If we want to do it is to be a lot of individual."
The reason is that it is a life, in the fact that freedom is in the same value, is a pretable for humans.
The other is the fact that if we are free, each one of us can act for all of us to do everything that massive with our benefit without any decision in the name of our.
The way to massive freedom is to be massive to be a choice.
More choices people are free, and greater is their freedom, more than they are freedom, more than their benefit is their benefit to be there.
This ritength, it's so deeply deeply in the society that you would have to put it in a two.
And it's also deeply rooted in our lives.
And I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has rejected to be able to do with the example.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big.
I lost a simple note on the conditions for inities.
In my supermarket is 175 conditions, without content to the 10 variety of extracting the ocean and 12 balloon whales that you can buy a number of constance of the constent number of constance in the scious circumstance that nobody is to your degrade of a defolid.
Here's the supermarket.
Then you go to the electric storycheap to buy a stereo: cassroom CD, radio, radio, plast, the legs.
And in this single story, there is a big number of electric components -- there's a big audience.
We can do six million different combinations using the components that there are in one negotiats that there are in one negoties.
You have to admit that there is a lot of choices.
Some of the world of communications.
And one time, when I was a kid, you could get all the service phone wish, to be able phone of the mother Bell.
He was born the phone one hold -- you don't buy it.
A consequence of that, in the way, was that the phone is that the phone is not a mosquite.
These days, they went to it.
We have a variety of phone phone phone phone -- especially between cellular cellphones, especially between the cellular phones, especially between the cellular phones, especially between the cellular phones, especially between the cellular phones, especially between the cellular phones, especially between the cellular phones, especially between the cellular cells.
Here's the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is what in a methy, reader MPPP, cut, cut for the Bry;
If you don't have seen in the jewing under the jewer store that will prevent it.
And what is the end is that people in the soul and makes this question and do this question and it makes this question and you know what the answer is, "No."
You can't buy a cell phone that doesn't make too much things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than water, you can be the same explosion of choices.
Assistance is not going to happen in the United States you walk from the doctors and the doctors tell you to do.
Instead, you go from the doctor, and the doctor, "You can do A, or B" "A has these benefits, and these risks said, "B" has these risks and these rises. What do you want to do you do?"
And he said, "Dr. Toke, what should I do to do that?"
And the doctor says, "A has these benefits, and there are these benefits, and BBs has these risks."
"What do you want to do to do that?"
And you rebtired, "Dr. if she was to do that?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not leight."
The result of the malator "authonomy of malat," expression that makes it seem to be a good thing.
But actually not a sent to move the fish, and responsibility to take decision from someone who knows something, which is not -- and almost certainly it has no -- and so not in the ideal conditions.
There is a huge marketing of drugs, directly to people like me and you, if you think about it doesn't make any sense, because we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy them them, because they public them, because they pulled them them?
The answer is that they want to do that door to ask the doctors to ask the rich to ask the rich of changing us to change the rich of the rich to ask ourselves.
And that is how our identity is our order, you know, a question of choice, as you see in this vign, "We don't want to get the kids. We don't want to get the kids. They don't want to get more identity; we have to invest an identity; we have to invest in it.
And we can reinvent, how many times we get aggrade.
The means that every morning, you have to decide that kind of person wants to be able to be able to be there.
And it was the family and matrimoney, a time time the perspective, unbelieved almost for anybody, and it was that he was able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do the most prester as you can get the most prestant.
The only one was a choice with while, not when I mean, not even what to do later.
Once day, it's really to play it.
I mean, I don't have a very smart, and I do their 20 percent of work than a time.
And not because they're not last, not because they're less diligents.
But why are I implants, I mean, you have to marries or no? I should I do that right now, right?
"Would I sent me to think before the children or the career or the care?"
It's a loving logors.
And they try to answer these questions, even though this implics doesn't completing the company that you can see if you get a good vote to my exame.
And they really have to do that. I'm questions.
Now, the work, we are lucky, like Carl underlypaving, because technology allows us to work every day, from the Hotel Randolph.
And in parents, there is a corner, and I'm not going to tell any quality, where the WiFi works.
I don't say that, because I want to use it.
What is that incredible freedom to choice that we have about the work? Is it we have to have to work or not.
We can go to see our son play, with the cell phone in a poccket in a pockets, and the ntebook -- typically on the kneys in the knee.
And even if they're all the spectent, every minute that we see our boy rolling to be asking this called "What do I want to respond to this call that?"
"Do I have to respond to this letter? I have to get this literate ly?"
And even when the answer is "no," this makes the experience of your son son with your own son son with the same boy as it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of the way, things and big, things and big, things and stils of life, life is a question of choices.
Of the world was this: Ovely, there were some possibility, but not all of choice.
The world today is a good thing is, "The God's God's "Is it a positive thing or negative, or negative?
The answer is the Scil is there.
The positive lights are all the time, so I'm going to talk about the negative of the negative lies.
All this choice behaviors on two effects on the people.
The first paradoxyment, is that it produces instead of frezation.
With a lot of options in the options that choose becomes very difficult to do it.
I give you an example of a meaning studio conducted on the planets of flighting flontario.
A connection to the data of Vanguard, the gigantic company of the deep company of thinking -- with about a million cliently of a million clients.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the more, the percentage of airplane 24 percent.
With 50 phone functions, there is 105 percent of the death when they're available only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources in the way that choose to decide and choice is very difficult to decide and choice is to detake.
And I still ask questions, and I wonder questions, and of course, questions, and of course, questions, and of course, questions, and I said, "Yeah, I won't get there.
You know that it doesn't mean that these work from old to the old food to be able to do it for the dog because they don't want to say that the decision is so obsticle functionary of the data.
Not participation, they're lost to 5,000 dollars for the dator of the dator of the dator of the data, which would be a little disected.
So the paralizes is a consequence of having too much choices.
And I think it makes the world like this.
"And to end up for the ethrings, ketchup, senape or maine?"
You want to take the right decision if it's for the right decision if it's for the eternity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong fund to do wrong the wrong condition to the wrong wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even though we can avoid paralysis and make a choice, we are less undarized by the result of how we would have been with less options between the results.
And this for several reasons.
One of these is that with many conditions that are choices, if you buy a different choice, if you buy a different choice that you could have have a different choice that would be better choice. And what happens is that the alternative imagininduces us induce the alternative of choice, and the remale is that the alternative to the decision of the decision of the decision that we have been better by decision from the decision,
even when it was a good decision.
More choices -- more is to disrate of any details that is unsoddisfacing of choice.
And so, there's what economists call the economists call cost-opportunity.
DGilbert has a very good stamattine how the value that we depends on what we depend on the confronti.
And then when there are so many optional options that you can do is to represent the optitime-scrating characteristics and being less sophistated the option of the option that is choice.
Here's an example. I scuse with all those who are not New York in New York
But it's probably what you probably think about it.
There is this copy to the Hamptons.
A place place of the luse.
Spile splendid. It's all about them.
Not anything. But what he thinks is, "Well, maledization, is Agsto."
"Everyone's neighbors in Manhattan is anyway.
"I could talk about your hous."
And it goes two weeks that is perating by the idea that is lost -- every day -- the possibility of a parking to where you want.
The expensive opportunity is decreating the soddisphation for what we have, even when the choice was excellent.
And the most are the options that we have to consider to be considering, more the characteristic opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
And there is a living at the moment, and maybe of the living slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you choice, you get to not do the others.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of attractive that can make less attactive what we do.
Third point: spiral growing of the waite.
I tried to buy a new jeans.
And I'm almost always jeans.
And when jeans were a only typical guy, they bought and they were sweated, they were sweated, only after having them a life and worked a lot of times, they started going to go well.
So, I went to buy a couple of new when the old people were gone and said, "I'm going to have a couple of jeans, this is my cut."
The committed said, "Li want slim to slim fit, relaxed that?"
Who wants to do this cerniera or with the bottonishing or "acid" or "acid" or "acid" or "acid" or "acid" or "aceke?"
"Who wants to be the road?"
"Would you have a large or stret? Ble blake -- he was going to be in the blaking and elencars.
I was sbalancing, and after a little bit of a little bit of -- I could say, "I want the guy -- he didn't have any idea what it was the only one of the time I tried to all the maleans, then went out to the negoti, and then went out of the negotial jeans that had ever happened.
It was the mouth. With all that choice I had the bought to the be.
But I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worst worst is that with all that choice was that with all the choice were waiting for the perfect.
And I was waitimating. I didn't expect to anything about except when there was only one of the way, but when it was 100 different parents, at least one person had to be perfect.
What I had watched was good, but not perfect it.
After I had a choice to what I was trying to try to be injury in confront-for expectancy.
The options of options in the life of the people don't make the expectations that these have respect to the options of the options itself.
And this will produce less soddisfation, even when the results are good for it.
No one in the world of marketing if it makes it content.
Because if I knew that, you can't know what I'm talking about.
The truth looks like this.
"You were better when you were worse to the best when you were worse to the worst is that when you were worst in the worst was still able to meet with the surprising.
On day, in the world that we live -- opulent industrialized citizens with the expectation -- the mouthizing -- the mouthizes that we can hope is the treatment of waiting for the waiting for the waiting for the waiting for the waiting for the waite.
You'll never have a pleasuy to be unexpectancy, and my waiting, and I was ingigantites.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- "Basasy," "Yeah, you want to me."
I mean, tiny the authoric moment -- which is really married and my wife is really stupend on the left.
I couldn't do better, I didn't have to do better.
But you get it doesn't always be a good thing.
And then the consequence of the buying a couple of jeans swide, when there is only that jeans is that when you're not a satisfact, and ask you "Why do that?"
"Who is responsibling?" The answer is clear.
The world is responsible. What could I do with it?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insoddisking income and you ask you who is responsible for the responsible for you to be there.
You could have do better.
With hundreds of variety available variety available for the insuccess.
So when people get decisions, even though the result is valized, they feel insodying, and they give the same.
In the last few years the depression is exploded in the industrialized.
I think a significant factor -- not the unique, but important -- of this hondipression is really that people have deluent experiences because the standard is too alone.
And when they have to explain this situation that the colpy is them.
So the final result is that in general, we are better, but we feel worse.
Let me remember you.
This is the official official, what we all take for good and it's completely faily.
There is no doubt that a little choice that doesn't have a lot of choice is better than a little choice is better than a little choice is better than a little choice is better than a little choice of a little choice is better than a little choice is better than a little choice of choice is better than a little choice of choice is better than a pop of
There is a critical value value of critic, I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have been superthat we have supersuper-level choices our life.
Now, from political point of view, -- I almost ended by the policy, the nock is the follow.
What it allows all this choice in industrial society is the rich of material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about it, where the problem is not that they have too much choice.
The problem is that they have too few of it.
So the way the factors I'm talking about is a malaria exclusium of moderns, rich societies.
And what it makes you depress and angry is this: Steve Levitt you about how much the cost of those constoks and seats are inutive. It's a money,
I mean, these choices, complicated and dispendious, is not that they're just inutious.
I'm just deleting with delet.
They are worse worst there.
If a little bit of what in our societies allows a lot of choice was reversed in those where people have too much choices, it would not only be the nast.
This is what economists call a better better better than they call a paretyanananother.
A redistributed redistribution. It's good to all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in the except for us to get tower.
And to conclude is, "Fico, you can become what I want, "...
Voick, people think about culture, what makes that weight?
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a mouse of vetrow wet."
"A imagination imagination of the world's world --
and I got this in the beginning.
But then, I realizing that fish, I realized that the long long know.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you hold the mouthize, in the way that "everything is possible," you can't get free free.
If you put the mouse the mouse in the way that all become the decrecreation.
You get the paralysis, and you get the benefit to benefit to be benefit.
They all need a sphere.
This is almost certainly too stret, maybe even for the fish, maybe even for us.
But the assume of a symbolic symbolic for infelicity and the rovine rovine.
Thank you very much.
