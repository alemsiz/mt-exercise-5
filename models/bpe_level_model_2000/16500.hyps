The year I showed these slides to show that the glacial calculus that the glacial calculus in the size of 40 million years of the 40 percent of the United States of 40 percent.
But this under of the gravity of the problem because not show it of the glacia.
The artics are art -- in a sense, the curior of the global climate system.
You get the wind and wind and wind and wind of the expand.
The next next slide will be a rapid careful carefuel came up with the last 25 years.
The jack is ended in red red red red red red red out of the red.
As you see, you see it until the blue screen.
That's the ice in wind, in the wind, which is the extend of extreme.
You can see that the cosidy glacior five years or more, is like the blood -- it's like the blood of the body.
In 25 years was spent from this, at the time.
This is a problem because the interested in the terrather than the earthly land where there are huge amount of carbon of carbon of carbon and congeled that scientists that are going to put it in meters in meters of microbies.
Ripush to the totality of the atmosphere, that further than global warming, that quantity could radicated, surrounded this point of not returning out to the point of not return out to the point of the atmosphere.
In some laghi deep in Alaska fashion the water.
The professored professored professor, of Alass of Alass of Alass a team in a team in the worder to deal with a team in the worten score.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: She is good. The question if we will even now.
A reason is that this environment scale of terms of the northern Groenland from northern the northern Groenland in the northern Groenland is that environment.
This is a glacial regime
The leaded was never reach levels like similar levels.
This is the fiume Kangerlussuaq, in the so-obest of the Groenland of the Groenland of the Groenland of the Groenland in the so-called the River.
If you want to know how to site the level of the gain us to the gather, here is where you get to the sea.
These rents are increasing rapidly forward.
Another part of the planet: Antarctic, the biggest block of the planet.
The scientists have decket that the birth of the glacior is in negative negative and that the Antarcticks, which is particularly point on on some isolar iiisols in the sket.
She was six feet of water, like in Groenland like Groenland and in Groenland and of the sket.
She was the Himalaya, the most biggest block of glacive new side of glaghi, who were ighia.
40 percent of the world's population was going to be able by the point of population from the scientist.
Here is the skylyair is the fundamental water of this city.
The door is increased up is increased.
But when you diminies, the same across the water of the water point.
In California Sierra Nevada is diminured of 40 percent.
The rights are in crisis.
The predictions, like you have a lot of them are graved.
The growth of the world door a night in the door of the gain in the world door of incends.
The environmental disaster disaster from normal and without the normal and without previous precedent.
Four times more number in the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the previous repattern in the last 30 years older than 75.
This is a gain of all unsten.
If you look at the context of the story if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we add 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the Eific area of orient, from America from America and both of the continent parts of the continent of the continent of the continent of the continent in the ocean.
Most of global warming, global deforestation, together to deforestation, that is the 20th is the usual usual deforestigate of the deforestation of the deforestation,
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is even even worse is even even worse
The United States are one of the two countries with the more emissions, together together to China.
And it was proposed to build a lot of other central central carbon for the carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of other central centers.
But we're going to be a change,
These are the ancient projects in the last few years and some propositions.
Actually, there's a political loty in our country.
The carbon industries of oil and oil have 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon and the carbon and the oxyymen that is a oxyym.
And I remind me something,
I know Nat, in Tennesse, where I live a perdity of 3.8 billion literally charge of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of the Tennesse,
Maybe you saw him on the news.
This is the second largest flows in America.
It's happened around Natmal in Natma.
The natalized natalia of of carbon industry was those.
Video: Meeat the carbon is a bail.
It's a skin here in America, and it makes our economies.
Frosty carbon is always more cleaner and more clean.
It's about precise price, and the workers and the workers and holding the style standing the stery standing the stand.
Al Gore: Do here is a lot of the carbon of the West Virginia.
The biggest society of the mountains is Massey Coal. This is the loadministrator.
Video: Don Blankenship: I'm going to be asking -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelow, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Proteens for the Clima Proteen.
This is one of it, a party.
Video: Actor: Actor: Actum we see the climate changes like a minacross the climate of our business.
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a public sfloority of money to make public and confuses the truths on the carbon of the carbon.
In fact, the carbon is not spork.
We think it's a good -- has a good profum.
So not predictately,
Let me do to do it.
Video: Aclean -- you can have heard about a lot of talking about a lot about a lot of it.
So let's do a game in a framing structure of the carbon for the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the clean.
Straordinary machines are a little roads of the carbon of the technology of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the technology of the carbon of the technology of the carbon of the technology of the carbon of the charge.
The carbon is between the main of the main the major global warming, but the night of the carbon is the carbon that you see change.
You have a look at a eya: this is the technology of the carbon technology.
Al Gore: Inden the alternative positive to the economic issue and the national security and the national security and the national security.
Video: M: Man: America is in crisi; the national safetet, the national set, the national climate climate crisis.
The film that college all of the connection of the combustible combustible combustible and the important.
Now, there's a new audition for usual solution for us.
Biker America: 100-hold-holds.
They like to put America to work, making us to work out of the work, and help the global scale of global warming.
And inally, a solution that bastern to solve our problems.
Reat America. Scoprints more.
Al Gore: This is the ultimate --
Video: I mean: I think it's about to read energy in America.
One of the fast faster than him, dependence from the combustible that kills the planet.
I knew about the future is here. I sole, sole, sole, a new energy.
It was a 2: Nuoves investments for the instances of working well as well of the retribal works.
M: Reat America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old old old old you you to go to speed to go to the sun.
If you want to go away to go away to this."
We have to go away to go away and fast.
Thank you very much.
The year at TED fect at TEDD, a Top on LHC.
And I promise to return to get back to how the machine.
So I came up here. And for those who are not there was the other time there was no scientific experiment in the scientific experiment -- 27 kilometers of circumstances of circumstomors of circumstomer of circumstop of circumst
His compit to receive conditions that were less than a second of second the beginning of the universe -- until at 600 million times a second.
And that's just environment.
This is the car below Gineva.
We have a picture of these mini-Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big B.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is larger -- it's larger than 22 feet of 22 feet of 22 feet of 22 feet of a 22 feet of a 22 feet of half and has a diameter of 22 feet and a diamet.
This is a space, a space, ATLAS in building in building proportions.
10 sets of the last year we have access, we accesor the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was causing festimmenses in the heaven of control.
It's a picture of the first fascious picture of particles that had all the game of the LHC, and deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and difficult particles in the relieve.
In other words, when we see that picture the 10 set, we understand that the machine works, that the machine, which is a great lifetimes that is a great lifetimes that is a great life.
I don't know if it was this to do us more opening to do that, when somebody went to Google and saw that the beginning was this --
That means we had a cultural impact of the scientific impact.
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, I had to have to these films here -- these films -- these files.
These films are 13,000 prints when the machine works in the massive of power.
Now, technical technical and and the foreign and dige, "It's not true.
And they can do it because when they're very faster to become up with the surcondent films surfaces.
So, at least 271 degrees, to a inferior to that space in the star of the space between the stars, these files can bring that corrup.
In one of the most of the most innovate emila in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the files relief read that they read up up a remarkable electrics have to meet a resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is still more impressionate if you think that these magnets more than 20 tons than 20 tons in the tons of about 30 centimeters.
They are damage about 50 magnets.
We need to take it, what we had done in it.
We have recovered and add and add justed.
Now they're going back to all their place under the below of their below below under the ground.
I was the end of the LHC is will be new integrate again.
We access to get it and we can get to get the data or him, and we can get it to get out of our wind or him, and so our wind for discover whatever are the matter that are the matter that are the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain four-flight to the dibact of science and the engineering of science and engineering.
I think that the fact that it is so hard to go over the limits, I think it's the value of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the words of a scientists of Ingless, Humphrey Davy, which image, in defense of inuseful experiments of his inuseful -- his pull, his he's Michael Faray, said, "Nio Faraday, and he said, "No much of the human mind as the human human mind that are not in nature of science that are not in nature that are completely and our trivial squarters that are completely and the neighborhood that are not going to be completely conclumer than our trilled --
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about here, from the children, from a children, you play the morning.
While you realize them and realized them and realized them and move them and move them and realive, and resolve them and resolve problems and resolve relationships and relationships and relationships.
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand the way we understand part of the world around us.
So, from information informed by the useful performance of our interaction with physics, together to my collaborator Jeevan Kalanith, I started asked, "And if we have a computers, I started asking to ask myself as a computer's hands as police that is moving on a house to a handle with a foose that is actually a napplied information with a fyoung hands with bottom,
and we will be to our food pleasy?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided to explore the answers, building Siftable.
In words, a Siftable computer is a whole whole of interactive as a birth.
In words, a Siftable computer is a whole whole of interactive as a birth.
You can move with the hand, they can move the hands, and feel the motion and they have a fashion and a fashion, and a radio wireless.
But about, I'm physics, as physics, as the fixes of further just to relive to deal with it.
Siftable are the example of a new ecosystems for degrees to handipulate information.
And as they get more physics, consciousness of the motion, and the others, and the hand and that are more physics, and as more physics, and the other hand, of others, like motion, and the other of the interaction.
I'm going to start with some example.
This is configurated to show the video -- if you including the video is going to be in a direction, if you including it in the other parts of back.
These interacactive riters, the others.
If they are interested in what they mean it is their intor.
If they come up with the rest and they can see a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
If they come up with the rest and they can see a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
They also have their movement and incline.
We realize that one of the interesting of the interaction was the power to use gestures on the data, for example, "versation are" as if it was a book.
In this case, we have three Siftable to configurated as sects of green and I can use them to the color, where they mix of the color.
and I can use them to be able to the color, where they mix of the centry, where they mix of the centry, where they mix of the centry, where they mix of the centry, where they mix of the centry, where they mix of the central color.
If we have too much of it, we can put a little bit of place.
These are also beautiful ches of apprecially as the language, the mathematics and logical gics where people can try to make things quickly, and see the speed of the speed of immediately.
I'm -- I'm --
This is a sequency of Fibonacus that I do with a program.
We have a game of words that is in the words that is in the half between Scarabeous and Boggle.
Pratically, at every turns out of every turns on every Siftable, Proratic, Proratic, and I got a letter in every Siftable, and as certain the control of the words on a ditionary.
Then, after about 30 seconds remissing and a new set of lecks, and you have a new chance to try to get a new charge and new possibilities to try to make new charge and new possibilities of remisse.
Thank you.
Here's the children came in the Middle Lab, I did in a way that I did in a video and I took a video.
They are place to them very much.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of education of people in a lot of education of these things that are not to give people a lot of education of these things that are not to give you a lot of education is that you have to give people a lot of education.
You just say, "Would you have to do it -- and they know what to do.
Here's other people who tried it.
This is our most youngest headad, there there there to the right.
It actually wanted to implately implement.
They just were the morning for him.
Now, this is a very very simply of a interactive cards.
We wanted to build a tool for the English of the language Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new personal characters in the scene, and the Siftable Siftable to their associates.
It can inserve new personal characters in the scene, and the Siftable Siftable to their associates.
And it's doing it out the sun.
Video: The sunger is source.
David Merrill: Or he's left a treat in the scen.
Video: The treat the horrow.
Bel work!
So school Siftable and put them up close to the people can interact the people --
Video: Ba!
-- and inventing their story.
Video: Ca!
DM: It's a final story with open-open-in-well as you feel like you would.
DM: It's a final story with open-open-in-well as you feel like you would.
Video: I live it,
DM: The last example I have the time to show you is a tool, realized to recently, to expensive and exeguess music.
it's a tool, realized by recently, to exepling and exeguess music.
Siftable here are further away from sound like based and the bacteria.
Each one of these has four different variations, and you can choose which I use to use that use.
You can get these sound of these sound in a sequence, to comport your food or floor.
And modified it just doing a sound "sound a "sound sequence."
These are effects that you can control from live, as the reverse and the film.
And I attack to a particular and then including the skyet.
And then there are the effects as time and times a time and flies in the sequence.
Look at how it works.
Video: DM: We will put a base in two Siftable Siftable in two Siftable sequence, and we put it in a series, and we put it in the other basis of other base.
Now I put a basiline of bassy.
Video: DM: World World --
Video: I'm going to put the filter filter, so I can control the effect of the bacteria, so I can control the effect from the live of the bacteria, so I can put the effect.
Video: I know to speed to fast the entire sequencing the entire sequence, and the other time.
Video: I will add the movie of the movie to the base to the base to the bottom of the fall.
Video: I can recombine the sequence, "I can recombind."
So I didn't have to planned it before, but I can provising, make more than hundred or more cortouch.
And now, finally, I can get the whole sequence, inclining the whole sequencing the Siftland the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is build new interfaces more more than our brain and more more than our brain and the body.
And I had time to show you one of the results of the results of this perspective of this perspeck that we can get out of the laby.
The concept that I want to transmit you is coming this new generation of objects for interact with the digital media for digital media will information in our world that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the hour of talking to everybody with all of you.
I'm a written writing.
Scare books is my professional profession, but it's more than that, of course.
It's also the love and the fascine of my life.
And I didn't expect that can change it.
But what I said about something particular happened to success is recently in my life and in my career, that he took me to realibrate the entire rely reported with this work.
The particular thing I recently recently this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Ama," the qual, and the qual, and the qual, for some reason for some reason for somehopen in the world and became a sensational.
And the result is that everywhere from now, people are treatment as if they were condent me as if they were condent me as they were condent to me,
It true -- condence, condence.
They are all worried and said, "You don't have the pursue to do you can't get more to do than doing better?
You don't have to continue to write to write all of life could be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can important,
that can be to somebody to be able to somebody in the
It's running to be about, you know.
But it could go to worse about the most 20 years ago, when I started to say that more than 20 years ago, when I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a write score.
I met against the same reaction from the country.
And people said, "Don't you have to success?
You don't have the folding of the rified reflies of the reflies of the reflies that the human rift?
You don't have to do this mester for all of life in the life without the life that you never come out and die on a heart of diving on a heart of franky flies of flies of flies of fliing?"
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is, "Si."
I am country: I fear of all of these things.
I always had a path of the way.
And I also fear of many other things that people could not ine.
As and other things about and other things often --
But how to write I think and I thought and I thought and asked me to be the last few of course, why is it because y?
Is it it is it?
It's logical that everybody debt to be expect from a job that you feel that I feel born.
But what is that particular in the impresely creative to make us reliview to the mind-refashion, and in a way that other career doesn't do?
How my father for example, for example, and I remember a time in his 40 years of the activity where the activity that was asked if she was asked if she was asked if she was asked to engineer for example,
It never was -- that block of engineer John, how well you wouldn't you have to be -- that wrong.
It didn't work?
Onestly, the engineers as group as group as group of the reputation of the reputation of being alalcolized by the reputation of being easy depressive.
We have writers, we have enough this reputation, and not just writers but creatives of every general reputation of any general reputation of being enormously instables of instables and in the reputter.
And it's not rest that is to look at the tristers of the diodds, the magnific minds, only in the wind of the dive, and often to hand and often to them.
And the ones that are not suicide to be really discovered by their women.
Norman Mailer, before I die, in the last view of the view of my book has killed a little bit more extraordinary business of the working on the work of the work of the work of life.
But we don't have the way we heard about because we heard these things about because we heard these things that are completely interior somehow much we were completely interior relies and the environment that creativity and the environment will always be in a legacy and the art, and fine, it will always be in the anguy and the art, and it will always be a completely interior the anguy that the art, and the end, and the environment, and the
And the question I want to ask all of this is going to take with this ideas?
It goes out of this -- because it looks like -- because it looks at me not good for me to be good for anything that supposed to do this supposition.
I think it's odiout.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see it in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our greatest creative to live.
And I know that in my case -- in my case -- in my case -- it would start fugee to begin to the feeling of supposed to be able to be able to recover the circumstances where are in my careera.
Of -- insome, I'm very young -- I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very likely whatever write to write it will be right from the world as the work that I used to be used by the world as a jobs of my last book.
I'm going to sket, because we all have more or less friends here -- it's probably the most success is to my greatest success is to my suspects.
Oh, Gese, and I think!
You know this is the kind of though thinking that leads a person to start to start to get to gin the morning and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to do this work that we do.
So, the question become to become it?
And so I was a lot of reflective reflective to continue to continue to do a psychological structural cool, ok?
I had to find a found of further than I write, and my natural and the natural re's reaction of the ancient that react to get E, as I was trying to get out of the year to look through the time to look through the time, trying to see if I could have to see if they could have a lot of the best ideas and seeing more than have, if they could have the blooks and healthy to get out of the blood and write and the write of the blood of the blood of the blood and written and written en
how helping people creative to gestate inerent inerent inerent the creativity.
And that research was at the ancient Grecie and Roma.
Seguitems because it was in certain and then back.
In the ancient and ancient Rome -- people didn't believe that the creativity came to believe that the creativity came from humans, OK?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit of divine and that if you were from a few people from a few people and source dive, for distants and suspecute.
The greats were spiriting of the spirits of creativity of the creativity "demoni."
Socrate, wonderful of course, it was that you can have a demon that elarging from long.
The Romans were the same idea, but they called the species of spirit without a genius.
The that's big because the Romans didn't think that a geniius were not really smart.
They believed that a genius was this species that credive, that you believed in the walls of the study of a artist, a little bit like elfo Dobby, and that came out of the work of the artist of the artist of the artist of the result of the result of work.
It is the distance of -- that's the distance of the distance of which is the psychological psychological that you have to protect from your work.
And everybody knew that was that working, right?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things, like for example, no?
If your work was exceptional work was exceptional market, all of the market, all knew that I was helped by this incorpore.
If your work work falland, it was not all of your job, right?
They knew that was your genius, your genius to be a inabilities.
And so people have conceived the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then Rinascient Rinascient and changed this big idea; we put this great idea; we put the human human human beings and the misteries and without the misteries and without the creatures of the divinity.
This was the principle of the raational eximution and people started thinking that creativity came to think that creativity from isphere.
And for the first time in history, you coming to this or the artist of the artist of the arm, which is like a place with genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think that allows somebody to believe that it to believe that it to believe as a recipient as the founds, and the source of all misteries and the surpricible and ethers is a film, inconnectible or too big and ethers is a film or too big deal with human fracy or too big man.
It's like to ask somebody of engineer to engine.
but and distores and completely the ego and creates all these engines on the performance.
And I think it was this pressure to destroy artists in the pasts in the past.
And if this is true, and I think it is the question, and now?
Can we do it different?
Maybe to get back to a more understanding more than the human relationships and I creatiss creatiss and I creatiss creatiss of the human relationships between human relationship.
Or if they don't have a hot or perhaps a hope.
Maybe we can't cancellate 500 years of rational thinking about a 18 minutes.
And probably there is people in the audience that would be legitself with the scientific news on the notion of the notion that they follow people are going to follow their projects.
I'm going to be not convinced to all of this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why is it -- why is it?
Why don't don't think it in this way?
Because more sense of every other thing that I ever heard to explain explain the exasibility of the creativity of creatiss.
A process that as anybody who ever have tenty to do something -- so fundamentally, everybody here -- you don't get away -- you don't get away -- you don't get rationally.
And in fact, it can seems completely paranormal seems completely paranormal
I did this meeting in the extraordinary extraordinary with the extraordinary poet, but that was a poet, but that was a poeterly for the life and said that during his infancial infectial infancial -- and I feel at the walks, and I was in the walso, when a poet, and I was coming out of the countracking.
He said that it was like a fragorous tren.
And that was rotating to the land from the countryset.
And he felt going, because he did it get the earth in the wind of his feet.
It was to have a sole thing to do to that point and it was talking about it, "I run as a morning like a matta."
And so it goes to house and was followed by this poetise and wouldn't be doing another one of the piece of card and a fast, and a fast, and a fast, and the past, and the pind and fast, and it would be going to be on the page.
Sometimes he couldn't be fast enough, so it was going to get and corres and it goes to get into home and poetry it was going through and poets the rotate and she would continued to roll and it would continue to roll the exactly and he would continued to roll the "other poet."
Then there were those times -- this piece of the piece of times that was almost perdent the moments that was almost lost allowed it almost lost it was almost lost the moments of the time was not forget to the moment of the moments that was not forget it almost lost the moments that was almost perdent of the moment that was almost even even the moments that was almost lost of the moments that was almost perdending,
So, he was cording to house and was trying to charge, and he was looking for the poet, and he was going to be a matheme in the right while he was like it was like it was like it was a mathembunch and and the off.
And he was a poeter from the cody of the cody and the repitched the pine.
And in these fashes would be presented on the perfect and introduce and intacross the last word to the first major the last word to the first ma.
So when I felt -- it's packing, it's exactly the way.
I don't have my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a mule, and my way to work is, I can see it in the same horarian hours every day, and to work and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go to the right right right up and go to the right hand.
But even in my head, I got to head against that I was done against that thing,
And I image that many of you have the han didly.
You know, if the work and the work and the ideas and they would be able to be a certain funny foundly not honestly had.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to us to do not lose our head, but it makes us relief to realize it to hands?
And I realize, the best example of the contemporary that I have the Tom Waits, which I interview different years agago for a day.
We were talking about that, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the major the major the artist of the artist of the contemporary artist of the incar, to dominate these species of impulses of eming creatives to inforced by creatives to the major the major major the incarnation of the artist of the artist of the artist of life.
But then instead of it, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, and he was driving up for him.
He was going to go and fast and all of a tract of a tract tracking, which comes in his head, elusive and elusive and the framework and and the want, you know, it's wonderful, and you know, it's wonderful, but not how to take it.
It has no piece of cards, it didn't have a matheme mathem, it has no record.
So I started feel that kind of old old old old old old old him, "I'm going to be per, and I will go to per, and I'll stop it out of this song persemizone of this canczone of the fashion.
I'm not enough and I can't do it it.
And instead of going to stoppanic stopping up.
I'm going to go to the whole process and found something completely new things.
And he looked like the sky and said, "Scusa, not see that I'm driving I am driving that I'm driving that I'm driving the skyet, "Scuse, you can't see that I'm drive to the skyyet.
"You seems that can write a cancer of or?
If really really you want to exist, you get back to a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
And I mean, you have to add somebody else else today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process working changed after that.
Not the work was still still as you have to be as seed as seeds.
But the process, and the fish of the ancient was released when the genius, the genius, the genius, which was that the other problems and free it was going to come back from where it was coming back from where it was a whole thing that was a whole thing that needs to be a whole thing and returning back and returns out of the genior the genius.
but it was this piculiar to collaboration a conversation between Tom and this strange and extent that strange and extent that allowed was not Tom.
So I feel that story about changing a little bit about how I was working and already already me a volted.
And this idea, I saved when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Prega, and I wrote in one of those core in the disperation where we were working on and not to think that will be a disaster and begin to think that will be a booking.
Not just -- not just good worst the worst book.
And I started to think of designing this project.
But then I remember Tom who talked about the air and triggest.
So I went to my face on the hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-handle and I love my face.
And I said, "You know, I mean, "You know, both you know, both that if this book don't be brilliant to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not be brilliant not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not be brilliant not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not be brilliant not going to be brilliant not be brilliant not be brilliant not be brilliant to be brilliant not be brilliant not brilliant to be brilliant
Because as I saw in the way I haven't got more than that.
So if you want to be better and you have to present, and you have to give you your parts.
OK. But if you don't know it, I don't know it, I don't know anything about it.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I want to favor that I was recorded to me that I today, I got to do my parthe." Because at the end is -- -- the end is -- and it makes in the deserts of the North people were radiculated for the dances of the long dances that were going to get up and the albbag and and until to the albbbasis and until to the albe.
And they were always magnific because the ballers were professionals.
But every tape of course, something happen, and one of these artists was actually transfitted in fact, and one of these artists were actually transfitted in fact, and one of these artists became to realize it.
And I know what I know about it, because I know that you have all the time, a certain point, a certain point, a performance of it.
It was like the time you stopped and the ballery walking through a half a kind of car, and it was not doing anything from the sun, like 1,000 night before, but all of them are all night before, but all of them -- but all of them would be awful for the sun, and the balls of the sun, and the ballery.
And suddenly it doesn't appear as a human human being.
But you accepty from the didline and under the divinity.
And when this happen, I knew about them, people knew what I was, they called her name.
They were and they started to core and they started to cant, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Do God, God."
That's God, you know.
Curious note -- when the Morors invasic of the Spage of the Spage of the Spage of the Spage of the changed secodition of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, who's still in the fleast of the rest of the floor.
In Spay; when a artist has done something impossible and the magic "Ah, oh, oh, oh, hol, and I hope -- a score, and a score.
And it's big because we need.
But the problem is the day down, the ballery for the ballery and discovers that are 11 of the morning of Marteds there and the last of Martedy of Do is no longer more.
It's just a mortal death, and maybe it will never be more to make it more to make it more to him to the him of the alteet.
And perhaps no chanterm of Dod as I still have to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard to be hard to be hard to
This is one of the most dolorous lighest dolorous lies to make a creativity life.
But perhaps not to be so ancient to be so ancient if you can not believe it, that the most extraordinary extraordinary to your become from you to you,
But I just believed you have to prestent from a pictures of this squisite founded this squisite of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you fine.
And you know, if we think about this is all change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought for different months during the jobation of the book that public book that public book that public was going to follow the dest of my big deal with my big deal of the big deal with the degree of my big deal with the book that public booke.
And what I have to continue when I feel feel about the electried by this is, I haven't found the wall.
I don't have to be arms.
Continual to present, whatever can you have to be there.
If your work is ball, ball, bally.
If the divine, you know, I would assumption, you know, to let some kind of wonderful time to be able to be a moment in your sforce, then "Ole!"
And then I have the same your dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself it.
I think we have to get to teach it.
"Ole!" to you, even in the same hot for human hador and headadvertising to representing to representing to you get to representing to represent.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've talked about some of these projects on the human genome of what can meaningful and discovered new set of geniuss of genies.
Now we're starting a new percord: we started digitalize biology and now to go to digitalize that digital code of digital code of biology, designing and synthetizing life.
We always tried to take big questions.
"What's life, is something that many biology have been taking to understand various to understand various levels.
We tried different approach, reducing it in terms of the terms of terms.
We are digitalizing from almost 20 years hormas.
When we sequenced the human genome was going to go from the analogical world of the digital world.
Now we ask us to regenerate the life, or create new digit?
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the smallest genome of the smallest genome of these that can authoreplicated in labab.
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create a little bit more smaller than that.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the bottom of his map metabolic map of the now.
I redetempty this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimine, one to the time, it's very improbable, that this can bring to a vivent.
So we decided to progress to progress to progress this cromodified to defty the components to make some of these questions.
And so we started the wind of the "Possetize a cromother?"
It can be chemistry of producing these big molecules that we never have to create before we have never been able to create before we have never been able to create before?
And in case of fermatis?
A cromosome, it's just a piece of inerts.
The speed with that we can digitalize the life is growing up to exponential exponential that we can digitalized to deal with the exponential that we can digitalize the life is growing to den the life is growing to deck the life is growing up to degityzed.
Our capacity of our capacity code of genetic code of it, but it's better than that, but it's better than that.
And our more recently results the door of the exponential curve.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of pass to begin with a biothic reviews before the first experiments.
But we found that synthesize DNA is very hard to DNA is very hard to be very hard to DNA is very hard to be suspected to DNA is very hard to discovered that sintetize DNA is very hard to sintet.
There are decine thousands of thousands of machines of DNA, of the long-athers of 30 to 50 lectures and is a degenerative process of degenerative degreater is longer than the segment is longer than the segment of the world that are going to be more errors of thousand a lot of decines of the world
So we had to develop a new metom to assembling these framments and correct the errors.
And this was our first tent, particular from information of the digital information of the genome of Phi B.
It's a little viruses that kills kills.
We have designed framed the recorrection of the errors and kept a molecule, and I took a molecules of about 5,000 literally
The interesting interesting is when we took this piece of inertive material and we put it in the bacteria have started reading this code and draw this code and producing this code and produce of virals.
The virtual particles are then released by cellules, are back to the cellultimate and they distroyed Ellands.
I talked about recently with recently oil industry that they have certainly compreprecise that they have certainly comprecise this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things more in big things.
We wanted to build the whole cromosome.
I'm about 580 milecks of code code code of code code of code code of code code.
So we thought of building it in cassets of virus, so that we could change the cassets to understand what the cassets are components of a living cell.
The projecation is crucial and if we started with information in a computer, these have to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurated.
When you sequence, we set this genome for the first time in 1995 the standard was of a error, and the standard of the mibe.
We found out of course, 30 error. If we had that sequence, 30 error.
One of the process is to design, and the 50 lects that are objecting with all other segments that are with all the other segments of 50 lecks to build under unity to work together.
We can spot element until there are a lot of ones.
You probably have read that we put us in the board.
Think of this -- we have a genetic code on four literal literal code of four letters and T.
Three of those lects together with about 20 minamminous friends of the side of lectural lecpush for every minoid of the side of lecture.
So we can use the genetic code to write, frather than write, I think.
What we did at the beginning was automous to do it.
Some are states from the fact that was not poem from the fact that was not poek.
We have designed these segments to simply with the entire with the entimidle of these things.
There are imugly and they put them and put them up and put them together.
And we started to assembling of the parts, and when you were driving with five, and it taken the literally of 24 miles of the simile of 24 miles to get 72 miles to get 72 miles to get 72 miles to come to 72 miles a letter to 72 miles the lecks.
And every step we produced these segments in abundance so that we can sequence, so that we're tenty to create a procedie procedie -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatizing the process.
So, this seems to the tabellons of a tabellons of a basis of a basis of a basis of a basis of a basis of a basis of a fash.
When we are going to go to these very long long long than 100 miles more than 100 miles are more directly directly in E.
You get the limited tools of the tools of the molecular tool.
So we consider other mechanisms.
We knew another mechanism called recombination called recombination of a biology that in biology to repeak DNA to deal with the centers.
Here is an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radious dlastens, can sleeping three million radiation.
You can see in the south of his hundred thing,
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled as it was primal as primal --
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can set completely skly.
They can live under to get under it.
I'm absolutely certain life existing life in space, and you get to find new environments of water.
In the NASA showed that this aven.
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these process, just using the boards, just using the design approof of of inserious segments from inserious segments of the skill of the major the sket.
The liview of the automatically.
This image was not taken with a stype of electronic microscope with a microscope of rule.
It's a very big molecules that we can see it with a microscope with a law microscope of a law.
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the published that we did a lot of time ago.
I'm about 58,000 letting code code code code of genetic code of code code of code code.
It's the largest molecules of a structure that was created by the major man.
It has a fish of a 300 million of a 300 million honia.
If we stamp it with a 10 carefs without 10 pages to just take 142 pages to transck this genetic code this code of genetic code of genetic code of the genetic code of the type of the code of a code of carefs without a code of the genetic code of them to transck this genetic code this genetic code of
Now, how do we work? How can we active it work?
Of course, you can tramite a viruses is a game of girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria.
It's just as simpler than the eucarios as our eucarios as our res: you just get the nucleum and insers it is basically the process of clonation.
North argue the cromosome, is integrated in the cell phones, but we recently have shared that we are able to do a transplant transplant that we are able to make a complete transplace of a cell phone of active and active to active it into another and active it in the cell phones of the cell phones is a cell of the cromosom
We can have a party cromosometimes from a microbial species
The two are different than the topis.
We add some gene in more way to decide that you can decide that to choose for this cromother.
And then scientists and then science in a way to kill all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cellum was stupend on -- and you will appreciate our graphic sofftwo-cell phone is went into the cellultimate in the cellular cell phones.
And we thought we didn't think we couldn't go to the beyond to be more in the length of them in there.
This is one of the most mechanisms of evolution.
We found that many species have add a second or a second or a second or a second or a second of a second or a second thousands of new trats of new tratels of new tratens of a second or a second of a second or a second hundreds of a second or a second hundreds of a second or a second hundreds of a second or a
So who think of the evolution as a gene of the time you get a lot of the defect of biology.
There are in the income of restrial institution, which addigerism that degree DNA.
The cromosome, that was in the cell as the cell as it was not going to be a cell as well.
The cell phones the cromosometimes that we put hole.
You know, and it recognized the other cromosome, as extractly as a summmyself and we recognized with only crumode.
it became blue of genes that we put it up.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a gap of a gain a new species, and it turned out of the new species, which we put it in the new software that we put in the cell.
All protein are changed, membrane are changed, and when we gave the genetic code of equivalent and when we have transfer to what we have transfer than we transfer it.
Now, this could seem to look at the genetic software to the software we going to change things in the handiera enough to make things in a sustain.
Now, I have explained that you don't talk about genesis -- but of progress from three million years and a half of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambriana where they will make new species of digital process of digital process of digital process of the digital process of the gital process of the genesis that maybe about gene of the geness, but
Why do you do that?
I think it's enough obvious when we think about our necessity.
We're going to go from six billion and a half a billion in the next 40 years.
Rither for example, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one of the planet for 1946; in 46, and there will be four year,
We are having problems now to find food, water and food, water and banity, and bence, and bence, and bence, and a half a half of people.
It will be more during to do it for us.
We get more than five billion carbon of carbon of olide of olide of olide of olid.
That means millions of books.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process for a handle of process to replace to be a huge challenge of the enormous processes of a challenge to find biological processes of a huge processes of process.
In the most of the CO2 emission of CO2 from these materials that finishes in the atmosphere.
At day, thank you very much, because of scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the designed components for the future.
The electronic industry is just about component, and think about how many different things are coming out of different comes.
Our limited here are the biological reality and our imagination.
Now we have techniques, thank you very much, thank you very much of synthesization, to create what we call genomics combinatoria.
We are able to build a big robots that can produce a million hundred cromosometimes to the day.
Think of the 20 million different genes or to try to get to get to get the processing processing to produce the processing to produce or drugs, we can change a little team, and we can change more biology and making biology of science.
And it's just a standard section of standard.
We can choose to choose to survive survival, prodution or chemistry or carbon of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines
This is an instants of some software programmed on that we're working for seeing and designing species and designing species and design.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they will be not.
We know exactly coming out of their genetic code code.
Now we're concentrying on the floors of four-generation.
You also saw you who experiment from the grand was an experiment of the floor.
We have a second floors of second and third generation that will use enough pretty much more than allows than the higher as the opens of butanol.
But the only way the biology can have a great impact of the food of the food of food and the top of the food and limited the disease will be transform to design the CO2 in primal materials that are maker to design, and we think of it can be working on the earlier for the primor of a half of a half hands of quarter in about 18 months.
The sunlight to combined with CO2 is a metodo-half in our discovered in the world, we found different metodis.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
She lives in the ocean deep about 2500 feet of the foundation of eboildation of the water.
It rees hit from CO2 using a hydrogen, like energy.
We're trying to understand if we can instead of understand if we can instance, that can be transported by tramite tubs, to drive that CO2 in carbon to drive this process.
So I'm going to short we could have to form what is to increase what the basic questions that the basis is Noo, real -- we have the dest obiet, we have the obiet, and the oil.
Would you feel that you can't do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you know?
It would be a major of energy.
And we're working for using the same metodd-standing vaccines to create vaccines.
You saw this year with influence, we are always forth of a year and a dollar and a dollar, and a dollar and a dollar.
I think that you can change build combinable to change combinable in ancient an.
That's how the future could start to seem change, now, the tree of evolution, the tree of evolution, and the evolution with bacteria and indeed, and infinally indeed,
We are so much to improve people.
Our discover is to live enough to try to make a long way to try to make it. Thank you very much.
First of all I will see the most faster possible, some work working about the new technology that we took Microsoft in the Microsoft in the followed water in the Microsoft in the skystic.
It's a environment where you can interact in the local level that remote with a huge amount of data with a quantity of visual data in visual samount of visual data that you can interact with a local that you can interact with a huge amount of data that remote in which you can interac
And we're seeing a lot of gabyte photo digital digital zoom and continue, for a fast, and continue to a speed of sket, you have to be as a fall.
And it doesn't matter how big amount of information that we see how big we see the big data or the pictures of data or images.
Most of the photographs -- but this for example, but this for example, it's a provision from Bilibrary of Congress and reents in the game, and reents of 300 megapixel.
It doesn't do any difference because the only thing that limited the prestations of a system as this is the number of the pattern of any time. It's also an architecture. It's also a very flexible flice.
This is a book of data -- example, for example,
This is the Casa desoliid of Dickens. Every hold.
So to show you that it is just about head, and we can do a little bit of the thing, to make a real representation of a representation of the head, not a photo.
It could be a little artificial way to read a book for electronic book.
It doesn't have it recome.
This is a more realistic example of a number of of the Guardian.
Every big image is the beginning of a section.
And it will really give you the pleasum and beautiful experience, and the version of a view or a view of a view or a quote of a very simply of a teplicates of meet.
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of of the Guardian.
We created a fasulling a high-resolution, much more than what you use in a public normal normal normal normal published in the extra.
If you want to see the characteristics of this auomobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specific techniques.
And this really demonstrate some of these ideas to eliminate the limited space,
We hope that means to put up and other pop-up and other porcheries and other porks, not rest to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose temption, if not to say that we have contributed to dribut,
These are all the streets in the U.S. Somebody image of NASA.
So now we go to something else.
This is actually from the websk; you can go to the webse.
It's a project called Photosynth, which combine two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other research, and the visual computer in the Noah Snavely, a student, a student of the University of Washington, with the aid of the U.S. and Rick Steve Seliski Resear.
And it's from the web, gestishing.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen that we can go from one picture of the other and have this kind of experience, and we have this kind of experience.
But the space of space in the pictures here has actually an meaning.
Grashim of visualization of the computer have recorded these pictures together, so that you have the real slightly in the real slips of the reality of the neighborhi Grashi Grashi Grashi Roccurs -- have been screamed by a slide-show of image of a slide-show of image of a level of image of the space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There's some more space spaces.
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noah-- and this is a previous protype of Photosynth of Photosynthy -- to show you what I have to work for the first time to show you what I think is really evidence to show you what we have to look at the environment. And it's not necessarily to see the environment. And it's not necessarily to see the environment.
We had to worry about legal waiting and saw it and saying it.
This is a rebuilding in the Notare of Notare Dame images if Flickr. Basta digitate in Flickr. Basta Flickr and you get images of types of the camp, other of the camp, other of the field of these connections and represents represents a picture that you have to disappears to get to this model.
So I'm all pictures from Flickr and were all colleagues in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never have thought of finished to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratific accountries here.
I think you can see that it is a lot of different types of fun of fun of focamor: from those cells in the professional photos in the environment, muted together in this environmental environment.
And if you can have to try to try to look at the strange more strange.
Many are block from fact, etc.
She got a few part here is a series of photographs -- except of photographs --
This is a placer of Notrecortly.
We can go from the places of the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now taking from all of the memory of the interest memory, from the point of view -- and visive all of those data together.
All of those pictures become college, most of the sket.
You have a model of the terms that emerge.
Think of this as the long way of Stephen Lawler on the Earth
It's something that grows in complexity as a complexity that people use, and the vantages for who uses for who uses to us.
Their pictures are marced by other people.
If somebody is the idea of contrash of all these people saying, my picture of the name of Notare the name of Notare suddenly rechips of all those data, and I can use all of those data, and I can use as a point of engine, using the photos in that universe, using the pictures of the boundarious kind of cross-us-s-us-bodies of a cross-user.
Of course, a consequence of all of the extremely elaborated every part of the Earth, and the forced of the earth, and the images of the plane and images and satellaries, but the memory of collective virtual collective virtual plane and exceptive extremely elaborated every part of the Earth, but the collective virtual springs of the Earth, but by the consequence.
Thank you very much.
Who is Anderson: I understand? What your software to connect us to do is that for a certain point, in the next years, all the photographs of the world, all the photographs will be ready colleged with anybody in the world will be ready colleged together?
BA: Yeah. He's doing in practice is discover is discover
Shyperleck of hyperlink, if you want to be in imagine.
And it's doing it in the base of the content of the pictures.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the recheths of information that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that many of the seeds of information that many of the seeducation of information that many of these images that are seedons.
And when you get a research, you know, I diged a frash and the head of the web has a lot of information about pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the picture.
Now, what happens if that pictures up all your fing?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of the floor, and the fourth of the reckets that is really enormous effect of the retas.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the principal when you travels and one of the research of the research is the power of the research of the research of the traditions, between the wind, top of the wind, top of the floors of the floors of the floors of the floors of the plants.
Basti thinking that sciams Jaguar is still over the Viiia, or that the Lattea, or that the myths are still cools of meaningful meaningful meant or that in Himalaya, the budy of the respired Dharma, to remember the importance of the importance of the world that we live in the world in that we live lifeed sense that we live not exists in a sense of realality of reality, but it's just a model, but it's just a sense of a movie,
the consequence of a particular choices that our stird stirps that our stirps or a lot of generations ago.
And of course, we all share of the essential tratens.
We all have to procreate it.
We are dream of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning.
We have to deal with inexority of mortor of morting, so we don't surprising and ballos --
we all have a art art.
What we have found is the next scale of the dog, the ritof the dance of every culture.
It doesn't matter that are the East of the Borneo, or the World Borneo, or the World World World World World World World World World World World World Curander's Curander's Curandlevels in the heart of Sahara.
He was my journey of journey in desert a month again the desert of yak in the walls of the Qomolangma, the dest of the world.
All of these populations teachers that are other ways of existing other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking about other ways of movies in the world.
And if you get a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
And so we have the miridddrives of the world create a ragnatela of life, and cultural cultural and is important for the planet and it's important for the planet as the planet as the ragnatela as biosphifera.
And you can think of this ragnatela cultural as a narfer and you can call the etnight of all the conceptive the sket, dreams, myths and inspirations, inspired in the human hands of the human-environment, intuitions of consciousness of consciousness as a consciousness of the fashion of the consciousness of all the conceive, and you can think of the fashes.
The etnight is the fantastic patrimonug.
It's the symble of what we can be as as an inquisist as inquisist of what we can be in the ske.
And as the biosphere was gravely consumed higher is success to the etnight and purch, and purch.
No biologist for example, for example, for all the species was or on the extinction of the extinction of the most apocalthesis -- in the most apot of biological diversity -- and not neighborhood -- and not near the most optimistic cultural ithic diversity -- that of the cultural diversity cultural ize,
The indicates of all of course, the perdent language.
When you're born six language in this planet.
One language is not just by a vocabolary or a series of rules of rules of rules of rules of rules.
One language is the side of human spirit of human spirit of human spirit
It's the half of the animation of every culture.
English is a forest of the mind, a instead of ine, a pensive instead, a pensive system of spiritual.
And of those 6,000 language, while we were here sitting in Monterey, at least the half of the half of the children.
They don't have more teacher than children, which means that you don't feel about something, which is already already died.
What is more trister than being used by the silence, of the last to talk about the last to talk a language, of the last linguid of the wisdom of the daughts or anicipate the promise of the daughter?
This is a fashion of somebody in some part of the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks and leads with sets and leads with sets of a tombs of a Eningua.
And I know that somebody of you will tell "Is it not better than y?
The world would not be a better place if we all all the same language?" Well, we talk about all the same language. We are all the same slights.
Let's talk about a game
Scoprit of a track trackless what it means to not talk about your language.
I would like to do a journey through the etnight --
a little journey in the etnight to give you a sumption of what we're loying.
Most of us forget that when I say "different ways of existing of exister" inting very different ways of existing existing of existers.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some of the things I wrote in this book that I hope I hope to be able and providing some collegments, in case of collegments, in case not notaste.
I want to start with what I call "the officialy."
The official dog, the official dog?
The official dog, the official society in the Western societies the recity of the West: "If we want to massimize the wells of our citizens "The way to be to male freedom to be indetected to be indetected to be ine."
The reason for the side of the freedom is in the fact that the freedom is precious val, is precious for human beings.
On the other is that if we are free, no one of us can account for just connect to do everything that massimize our good, no one who decided in our well.
The way to massimize the freedom is to male choice.
More choices people hand, more free, and most of the freedom, and most of the freedom, most of them is their head.
These write, is so deeply radicated in society that no one was dreams of him.
And it's also deeply of our lives.
I'm going to show some examples of what the progress has repossible.
This is my surmarket. It's not particularly big --
I allowed a simple named on the inspired for inspired inspired for inspired for inspired for inspired for inspired for inspired for inspired to save it.
In my surmarket are 175 conditions, without contact 10 variety of olide and 12 acets of olive and the 12 acets that you can buy to be a huge number of conditional conditions that nobody of the scientists that no one of the 75 feeling is to your own own own terms of your own own degreat.
That's the surmarket.
Then you go to the snegotial of electronic, and a steree, sket, and the CD, radio, fast, and practice.
And in this single of electronic snegotial of electronic components of carefully
We can make six million and a half million combinations that are in a negotial that there are in a negotid.
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Other camp: the world of communications.
One volted, when I was a child, you could get all the services of the phone phone of the phonicians that they were fornitited by mamma Bell.
He wooked the phone, you didn't buy it.
One consequence of that, between the other one was that the telephone is not rop.
These are the temples are gone.
Now we have a variety of phones almost enough, specially between cellular cells.
Here's the cells of the future.
My favorite is in the half of the half of the hidden of the hand the hind for the horse is bule.
If you don't have seen in the negotial under case, you're well going to pretty much of course,
And what happens is that people entering in the negozes and do this question, and do you know what the answ?
It's not possible to buy a cellular that doesn't do too many things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the same explosion of choice.
Assistance, sample, not happens in the United States that you go from doctor and the doctor of what you have to do.
And then you go from doctor, and the doctors, and the doctors say, "Okay, or B" "A, or B" -- and these answers "B" -- and these risk."
You say, "Doottor, what I'd like to do that?"
And the doctor says, "She has these wells and these risky: and these answer."
"What do you want to do you do?"
And you can get it out, "Dr. If she was going to do it?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not lei."
The result of the result of the malato," expression that it seems to be a beautiful thing.
But actually, it's not that one is that one spot and the responsibility of the decisions that somebody knows what somebody knows anything that knows anything else -- and almost certain is not not -- and so in the conditional conditional conditional decisional to get decisional decisions to take decision.
There's a lot of marketing products to make drugs to people like me and you, if you think if you think if you think if you think you don't have no sense, you don't buy it.
But if we can't buy it, because you publishing them and publish?
The answer is that they want to do the doctors of the doctors to ask the rich of change.
And so fundamental thing like our identity is our identity issue of choice, as you see in this view in this view of the children. We don't want to force, and they will not be invented.
And we can reinvention us to reinvention us to us again us.
The means that every morning to the risk of the rise, you have to decide that kind of people wants to be there.
Ripush at the family and the world's perspective for anything for anybody in the point, was that you could have the most pretty possible, and he started to get the most pretty possible.
The only choice was with choice was with choice -- and not that what do do down.
Ogo, everything is really from play.
I think about intelligent students and I think about 20 percent of the 20th of working for a time.
And because they're not brilliant, because they're not less deligent.
but why I'm impensiers, I mean to ask or nowing I should do it now? I should do it now?"
"I should be more to get it more to you have to think before I did it before I did to the carer?"
I'm interrogatives logorian.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implements not completely completely to compity, and not get a vote to your exame.
And they have to really do it. I'm going to ask it.
Now, the work: we have fortunated, as Carl Carl technology we have to work every day, because the technology of every day, every day, every day, every day, from the Hotel Randolph.
To parents there is a angle and I don't tell anybody where the Wii works.
Not not to say that, because I want to use it.
What does this mean this incredible liberty of choice that we have to work, and it is that we have to decide or not.
We can go to see our half hoken with the cell phone in a tasks, the Blackberry in the other, and the nest bookberry in the hokberg, and the keye.
And even though they're all spent, every minute that we see our boy that we see our boy -- we also have to say, "I have to answer this called the ata?"
"I have to be avail? I got to abboard this letter?"
And when the answer is "not, all this makes the experience of your own own experience, of the head, and it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of any part of it, little bit of a lot of things, and big materials and the stily of life, and life is a choice.
Once the world was this: there were some choice, there were some choice.
The world of today: The dilemma is -- "Ilemma is a positive, or negative negatis?"
The answer is Shim.
The slide of the negatives -- so I'm going to talk about the negatives
And this is all the choice behaviors on the gentlemen.
The first one, paradoxy, is that produces investment is that freezed instead of free.
And many options of the floor, it becomes very hard to do it.
I offer an example of an example of mean an an instance,
My colleagues of the Vancient Vanket, the gants of pension, with about a million deep holid of thousand clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found it is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the more, and the percentage of adescenes of adescens of adescenes of adescens of adescens of adescenes that are offered in the adescens that are offered in the more, and it turns out of the 22.
With 50 founds, there's 10 percent of less than the adesionate when they are available to only 5.
Because with 50 founds, which is the choose, is maledetail, and the choice is remaking up to the inkill of the questions.
And at the questions, and still asking questions, and of course, and of course, and of course it goes up.
You know that they don't mean that these workers will not just drive food for cancers because they don't have enough money, that the decision is so ostick is so ostic that is so ostics of complementary degreats of work.
Don't you have to 50,000 dollars for 50,000 dollars for a year from work, that would be well to be able to address to be able to versars.
So the paralysis of being a consequence.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And for finally, for the eternity: "Why except or major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major may?
You would just take the right decision if it's for the right decision, if it's for the eternity, right?
You don't want to choose the foundd, and the wrong condition.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even though we can avoid the paralysis and do a choice, and we have a choice, and we have been with less options of how we will be found with less options that sceers.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of condition, if you buy a choose, and if you get a choice, is to imagine that you would have to imagine that you would have been better to do a different choice that happens is that alternative imagined and the alternative imagined and the rescreens of choice, and the receive the sods, and the received by the decision of the decision of the phation of the phoootos of the receive decision of the
even when it was an optim decision.
More choices us -- more easy dispieces of any details of any details of the choice.
And there's what economists called opportunity to the opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asked very well stamine as the value of the depends on the things that we are confrontive to the die of the confrontal value that we are confrontation.
You should say, when there are many options to be able to represent the career careistics of alternative charges and be less to be satissfied of the options that you have choice.
Here's an example. I got with all of the ones that are not in New York.
But it's what probably probably thinking.
There's this copy of Hamptons.
A place of suspect.
Spid saves of splendia.
Not nothing that he thought he was thinking, "Well, the disease, it's Ago."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are vie."
"I could talk about their home."
And the two weeks assilled from the idea that is perding -- every day, every day, every day -- the possibilities of parking where you want.
The cost-opportunity diminiscreens the soddddiscovered for what we have, even when the choice was excellent for that we have been excellent for that we have, even when the choice is opportunity diminiscreen.
And more of the options that we have to consider the more than we have to return us to relive against how it is opportunity.
Here is another example.
This views about a lot of things.
It talks about the moment, and perhaps the moment, and perhaps of the live lently live to live the moment, and maybe of the live of live liviviews.
But the most important point is that any choice, you choices you choices not to do each other.
The things that we don't have a lot of foods that can make less less atten.
I was going to be scoral growth of the waits.
I tried on my pelle pelle a new jeans.
I got to almost always jeans.
Once jeans were just a type and wind them and wind from the best, they were comfortable to have them a life and she was a lot of times and worked on a lot of times, they started to go good.
So, I went to buy a couple of a couple when the old old old old old people were lead, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cute."
The come, "World wants to be slim fit?"
Would you like the cernier or with the bottonight?
"You want to road you go.
"Sowevers or stretty? Bla blak and the blak -- Continug.
I was sleep, and after a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of che-- I want to do the type -- it was the only one idea that I was so so for all of the same as I was going to be able to have all the stop of jeans that I had ever ever ever ever was the best best jeans that I ever had ever ever ever had.
It was the mas. I had a choice I had a basic half.
But I heard I heard about it.
Why? I wrote a book for a book for understand.
The reason I was worse for the worst of my choice is that with all that choice were expectations were alygo, the jeans had to be perfect perfect for the jeans had to be perfect.
And I started waittype I didn't expectations of exceptional when I was just a type of a type of 100 different guys had to be perfect.
What I had water was good -- but not perfect.
After I was talking about that choice with what I was trying to insoon on to waiting to waiting.
The add of options in life of the people don't form to inform expectations that these are respective of the stame.
And this will be less soddddiscovered when the results are good ones.
No one in the world marketing if you make content.
Because if you know it wasn't knowing what I'm talking about.
The truth veries more about this.
"You was better when it was worse when it was worse when she was worse when she was worse when it was worse when she was worse when it was worse was still to meet of the surprised surprised fliven to measures
Ogay, in the world where we live -- opulent, industrialized citizens with the expectancy -- the massive -- the massive things are at the height of the waiting for expensive --
You never have to resurprised because you have your waiting, and my waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and they have injump.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is what you're here -- "Yeah, you wait."
I want to say -- little moment -- I have a hobiograph, and my wife is really him, and my wife is really stupend on --
I would not have to do better half a better him.
But you don't always have a good thing, it's a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of jeans of jeans of when there is just that kind of jeans is that when you don't have to be able to do you have to ask you "Why?"
"Who is responsible responsible is clear?"
