Last year I showed these slides to show that the calculation that the artical glacial actica, which for almost three million years of the size of the 48 United States has been the size of 40 percent.
But this undervalue the problem because it doesn't show the extra ice of the problem because it doesn't show the pace of the ice of the problem because it doesn't show the pace of the problem because it doesn't show the extra ice of the problem because it doesn't show the pace of the problem because it doesn't show the expace of the problem because it doesn't show the expace of the problem because it doesn't show the exce
The artical glacial calotter is in a sense, the heart clear heart climate system.
You expand in the winter and return it into the summer.
The next slide is going to be a rapid careful carrot on the last 25 years.
The lost beings are signed in red red by the red of it.
As you see, they expand it out to the blue Europe in the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue Europe --
That's the ice in the winter that reported in the summer.
You can see that the so-called the chance of five years or more, is like the blood here is the blood here from the body.
In 25 years is going to go from this to the way.
This is a problem because the heat care of the ice around the artc landing around the artc ocean where there are huge carbon on congeled that that is sheet that that is sheet the microbes.
It respect to the total pollution of global warming, that amount of global warming, that amount could double that we can't return this point of not return this point of not return this point of not return back to the whole thing that we don't return it back.

The month last month of scientists have been delighting, that the ice of ice is negative, and that the Western Western isold, which is particularly rapid in the skies of some submarine islands and the sheet is very quickly rapid in the sheet of the ice is in the negative, and that the melt of the scientists

The environmental disasters are going to get a rhythm out of the normal and without previous precedented it.
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years than the previous 75.
This is a whole whole whole thing of all unsustainable
If you look in the history context if you can see the consequences.
In the past five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the area of the Pacific Gold East, from Amers' Amers' and both the parts of the subcontinent in the subcontinent -- where there is an impoor in the ocean oceans.
The biggest cause of global warming, together to deforestation, which is 20, is the use of fuel fuel fuel fuels.
Oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions, with the larger China.
And he was proposing to build a lot of other central central carbon central carbon central carbon central carbon central central carbon central carbon central carbon central carbon cents.
But we're assisting to a change of direction.
These are the projects annulled in the last years and some evidence of alternative versus in the last few years and evidence of the last few years and propositions of the past years and some evidence of alternative projects in the last few years and some evil.
And anyway, there's a political lotts in our country.
The carbon industry and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon clean carbon pull carbon and that is oxymore.
That image I reminded something,
Virse Natal, in Tennessee, where I live, there was a loss of carbon dive of carbon dive scories.
Maybe you saw it on the news of the news
This is the second largest flow of scories in America.
It happened around Natal.
The natalization of one of the carbon industry was this one.

So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a commercial effort to make public and consuming and consuming the truth on the carbon truth and consuming the carbon truth of the carbon truth to make it in carbon and consummate to the carbon is to invest in a commerci
In fact, carbon is not sport.
We think it's cleaned -- it has also a good profume.
So not preocured to climate change.
Let me do it.
Video: Attor: Clit -- you heard a lot of talk a lot about it.
So let's do it a whole whole thing in a structure to have a structure of the carbon cleaning carbon as well.
Straordinary cars are a little roty, but this is the sound of the ground.
The carbon consumption is between the main causing global warming, but the nieves of carbon warming that you see it changes everything.
So take a chance of the check: this is the odiernaked carbon technology.

Last year at TED I made a TED introduction on the LHC.
And I promises of return to back to how the machine.
So here I am I comes out of her, the other time we haven't her, the LHC is ever trigged -- 27 kilometers of circumstances.
His compit is to re-re-re-up the conditions that were present less than a billionth of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
This is just the environmental one.
This is the machine in the Gind.
We do these min-Big Bang in the relevel in the relevels of levels.
This is what I work. It's called AS TLAS -- it's like 44 feet and he's got a 2-meters of 2meters --
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
We have the 10 section of last year we have access the car for the first time.
And this photo was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immenses in the control.
It's a picture of the first particles of particles that had all the around of the LHC, coming into collid, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spreads particles inside the relevel of the relevel in the relevel of the LHC, and spreads particles inside the relevel of
In other words, when we saw that image 10 sects, we knew that the 10 secember, we knew that the machine that is a great living.
I don't know if it was this to do more than that, when somebody went on Google and saw that the page, and the living page, that the page was this one.
That means that we have a cultural impact over the scientific impact on the scientific impact on the scientific impact on the scientific impact beyond in the scientific impact over the scientific impact on the scientific impact on the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact on the scientific impact on the scientific impact of cultural impact over the scientific impact of the scientific impact
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, had to these files here -- these sleeps here -- these sleeps of the sleep.
These files are 13,000 printing when the machine works at the male of power.
Now, the technical of you will look at the files and say, "It's not true. It's true. It's not true.
And instead can do it because when they're very colding to the superconduct files.
So, at least 271 degrees, at least 271 degrees that of the space between the stars, these files can bring that current temperatures can bring that current temperature to the current temperature to the same time.
In one of the junctures between the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the files are going to be able to be reading and 13,000 advanced amps have been meant an electrical resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive, if you think that these magnets, weight more than 20 tons in the hons, and that they were moving from about 30 centimeters of them.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to get them to rearound.
We have repristined and uploved.
Now they're going to go back all their place underground.
By the end of the HC is going to be new inteam.
We accende it, and we expect to get the right data to jugment, and we keep our adventure to find out what the morning is the morning that are the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these framework return the debate on the value of science and engineering the value of science and engineering frontiering. It's easy to confuse.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult, the fact of going to the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I'd like to close with the words of a Inglese, Humphrey Davy, the guy, the guy, I guess in defense of his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, said, "No is so dangerous for progress of humans as the rent of the human mind as the rent of our trional mons are not mysteries that are not mysters in the conquist, which is not new money,
Thank you.
I want to start to ask you to rethink about how to do you get in the morning.
While you understand how to get them and grab them, get them and you get them and get them to get them and get sold and solving problems and resolve problems and space relationshiping and space relationships.
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us.
So, from the computer inspired by our interaction of our interaction with physical objects with my own Paci, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi, I started asking -- "And when we use a computer, instead of having the computer, instead of having only the mouse of the mouse as a computer, we could have a computer, we could have a desktop, we could have a computer information with both your hands,
and we get our pleasure to our please?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable is a great interactive like a big cookies.
In a few words, a Siftable is a great interactive like a big cookies.
You can move with their hand and they can see them movement between them, feel the same movement and they have a screen and a wireless radio wireless radio wireless radio wireless --
But most of course, they're physicians, like the morning, you can just move it to it just affect it --
The Siftable is of a new ecosystem to manipulate information to manipulate information to manipulate information digital information to manipulate information to manipulate information digital information.
And as they become more physicists, you know about the motion, others, and as they become more physicists, and as they become more physicists, you know, you know, we can exploring them of their movement, and other fun style of interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show the vide: if you put it into a direction, the video wheat like that, if you include it so if you include it in the other side back.
These interactive rhyththms are conscious conscious rences.
If they affects them are interested in what they are going to be done.
If they come circumstances, they can get it into a little bit.
If they come circumstances, they can get it into a little bit.
They also have their movement and un-lination.
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the common data, to address on data, like a liquid liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as blood and I can use them to adversate the color in the central that in the central place, where they mix them.
and I can use them to put the color in the central that in the central miles.
And if we are too much of it.
There are also nice possibilities of apprints like languages, the mathematics and games where people can try and see the fast things and see the results of the immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonaces that I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a game of words that is half of Scarabeo and Boggle.
Orly, at every turning -- I got a letter to every Siftable, Pratically, at every Take every Take a letter to go on every Siftable, and as you look for a dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds remisling, and you have a new set of reading and new possibility.
Thank you.
This is where the children came to the Media Lab, I made them so that they tried them and I turned a video.
They are pleasure a lot.
And one of the interesting things of this kind of applation is that you don't have to give you a lot of educations.
You just have to say, "Compions of words and their own what to do.
So that's where other people who try it.
This is our younger better, over the right.
It was actually wanted to be a pipes.
They were only morning, for him.
Now, this is an applation of a cardboard.
We wanted to build a tool for learning ling-layers is Felix.
It can put new characters in the scene, satisy the splatons in the scene, and they associated with them.
It can put new characters in the scene, satisy the splatons in the scene, and they associated with them.
Well, it's doing the sun of the sun
Video: The only is surging.
David Merrill: Now it led a treatment in the scene.
Video: The arancient treatment.
Bel work!
So if you go to school, you can get the news can make the characters --
Video: Bau!
--
Video: Hi, Ho!
DM: It's a story with the open final end of opening, and it can decide him as you did.
DM: It's a story with the open final end of opening, and it can decide him as you did.
Video: Gold, cat.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool of you have time to sample and executting and executting music.
is a tool, made recently recently, to sample and executting music.
Siftable here are acting as a low-down and bacteria -- and the bacteria --
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what to use.
You can put these sound sounds in a way you can make it compounds to your pleasure to your pleasure in a sequence that you can put these sounds in a way you can get these sounds in a way you can get to put these sounds in a sequence that you can make it into a compounds to your pleasure to your pleasure as well.
And you just modify it just by doing a sound and a sequence."
These are effects that you can control of live, like the reversion and the filter and filters.
The attacks to a particular sound and then fix, and then fixs to update it.
And then there are the general effects like time and volume, which you apply to the sequence.
We look at how it works.
DM: We will start to put a basic in two Siftable "sequence." We put it in a series, we extreme more fabulous about it.
I'm going to put a line of low.
DM: DM: Now I add up --
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the filter to the bacteria that I can control the effect of the live.
Video: DM: I can fast the whole thing in the time from a side or another.
DM: DM: And I'm going to add the filter to get more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombined the sequence "volo"
So I don't have to plan it before, but I can improvid, making it longer longer run.
And now, finally, I can discope the entire sequence on the left Siftable to the left the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces more like the way we do a brain and more like the brain and the body is.
And today, I had time to show you one of the outcomes, and also some possibilities that we try to bring out the lab out of the lab to the lab out of the lab of this lost results.
The concept that I want to transmit you is that it's getting this new generation of objects designed to interact with digital media digital media in our world that we want to do with digital media in the way we want to do it.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time of talking to all of you.
I'm a writing writing about it.
To be books about my profession, but it's more than that, of course,
It's also love and the folks and the folded of my life.
And I don't expect to be changing
But as I said that, something particularly happened in my life and my career, who took me to realibrate the entire realibrate with this work.
The particular thing is I recently wrote this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Ama" the quality, and so many of my prizes, so many people made it in the world and became a great constructional bestsellers for some reason he got in the world and he became a great sense, bestseller interaction.
And the result is that wherever you go from now, people who treat me as if I was convicted with it.
Really -- convicted -- convicted a!
They all come to me to all worried and they say, "You don't have fear you can't do anymore?
You don't have fear to continue write for all the life without being able to create a book that could care anything?"
that could care somebody?"
It's rassicurant, you know.
But it could go worse, part of the one of 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent -- that I wanted to be a writing a writer.
I would go into the same reaction based on the fear.
And people said, "Don't you have been able to have successful it?
You don't have fear that humiliation kill?
You don't have fear to do this mestise all the life without anything you ever come out and die of a cumulation of samp of the halling bank with the mouths of hading energy.
So, so you know, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is: "Yes."
And I afraid of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also have a lot of other things that people can't guess it.
As the algae and other things like that.
But as much about the writing what I thought and ask me the point of the thing I thought about the ly?
Is it rational?
It's logical that anybody should wait to be splented by a work that you feel born to do it.
But what's about so particularly in the impresumed creative to make us nervvous health of the way that other careers don't make them?
As my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he was afraid to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer capit?
It was never -- that block of John, how do you go?
It wasn't working like this, right?
And chemicals engineers like group don't have certainly unclearly in the seat, he made the reputation of being alcoholed maniaced.
We writers, we have enough this reputation and not only writers but creatives of every genere, we have this reputation of being enormously instable inable invity.
And it's not going to be going to look at the tristands of the magnifies of the magnifies that only in the 2th century, they die young people and often hold them.
And even those who are not suicide they look like being made by their womens.
Norman Mailer, Mailer, before he died, "Liter" said, "I was killed me a little bit more extraordinary about the work of your life.
But we don't really date that when we hear it saying this because we have heard these so long-way we have completely interiored and accepted the notion of creativity and suffering are somehow you and that art, and the art, and the art, and then will be going to be a lot of always enjoyed and the art, and then you will always get to anguys and accepted the notion are kind of dying it as you know that that
And the question I want to ask all of today, is you know, do you agree with this ide?
And you know, it's good for you to look at this -- because you look at this guy, it doesn't really do anything about this supposition.
I think it's odious.
And I also think it's dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great minds to live.
And I know that in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to get to the support of supposing the circumstances where I are in my career.
Oval -- -- I look at it, I'm quite a young and I have about 40 years.
I have a whole thing I have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely to write about what I write about now that it will be judged by the world as the work that came after my last book.
I'm going to be slavery, because we're all more friends here -- is likely to my shoulder.
Oh, Gesus -- which is thinking about it!
You know this is the kind of thought that leads to a person to start drinking gin and gone in the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would keep doing this work that we do.
So, the question becomes ond, right?
And so I always always after many reflection -- that the way to work to continue to write that is to create a psychological project, right?
I have to find a few ways to find a security of security between me, which I am writing the one that reaction that he written the whole thing that will be able to get over the time, trying to find some other societies of doing the most of the most people and healthy to find some of the best ideas and healthy and healthy healthy distance of healthy.
how to help people create creative people to run inherents of creative risks of creativity.
And that research led me to the ancient Greek and ancient Rome.
See the glass because over and then back back to the circle back.
In ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativitvity is from men --
It was thought that creativity was this spirit and became a lot of divine and that came from a few distant surprising and unknows, for reasons and unknowing and unknown.
The Greeks called these spirits of the Golins,
Socrates, wonderful believed of having a demone that elevately arge that heavily arge from far away.
Romaners were the same idea, but they called that kind of spirit without a genius.
The one that is great, because Romans didn't think that a genius was a genius was a smart.
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine entities that was credyed in the urs of an artist, a little bit like the elf, and that he came out to hidd the work of the artical arming work in the work of the acticket and modeling the result of that work.
Ecceptional -- there -- there is, that is the distance of which I talk -- that psychological that you protect you from the results of your work.
And everybody knew that was so that it was so that it worked, right?
So the ancient artists were protypes were protypes, like the too narcissnarcisssnarcisssnarciss; right?
If your work was exceptional work was not able to get the degree and all knew that it was helped by this incorporey.
If your failure, it wasn't all your whole be, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable to be a inable to be a incapable of it.
And so the people hanannounced creativity in the Occient for a long time.
And then the Resears came and all over this, and we put this great idea, we put the human being in the center of the universe over all the mysteries and unleaving space to the mysteries that write deadads from divinity.
This was the principle of humans rational and people started to think that creativity is completely from the hydumble dividden.
And for the first time in history, it started to reference this or artist as a kind of a person who is a rather that at a person with genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big mistake.
I think that allow someone, a simple person of believe being as a recicipe as a fraction as the source and the surprising mysteries of all the mysteries and unknowable and eths is a responsibility for a very big way to give the fragile that human.
It's like to ask somebody to ingocile the sun.
It deforms completely deforms the ego and creates all these ingestiable ingestible for performance.
And I think it was this pressure to have destroyed artists in the past-year-olds in the past.
And if this is true, and I think that it becomes it, and it becomes it?
Can we do it different?
Maybe you go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery mystery of human and mystery way.
or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes.
And there's probably people in the audience that would have been able to suspects of scientific suspects on the notion of the notion of the meeting people on the notion of the projects.
I probably don't probably won't convince you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to ask is -- why I know?
Why don't you think this way?
Because it has more sense of everything that has ever heard to explain the exasperants of the creative process.
And one process that as anybody who has been trying to do something -- so fundamentally, all here -- yeah, it doesn't have rationally rationally
And, in fact, it can sometimes look completely paranormal.
I did this recently with the extraordinary poetccle Ruth Stone, who has now 90 years, but that was a poet-all life and told me that during his childhood in the rural, and he was working out in the wood, and he was when a poeter came from the landscape from the landscape.
He said that it was like a fragorous fragorous fragorous frageous fragory.
And that was coming rotolding to her from the landscape.
He felt like to get to the land under its feet.
He knew it was to have one thing to do to that point and it was like, "currenters,"
And so it was going to go back and it was going to be followed by this poetry, and she wouldn't have to make a piece of paper -- and a match pretty quickly -- as the traffee and grab it on the page.
Sometimes he couldn't be quite quickly, so it reached and it was remote and it was remote and the poetry her her broads through and she lost and she lost and he would keep rotoling through the landscape, and he said, "another poet."
And then there were times -- this piece I don't forget that -- there were moments where it was almost lossing, right?
So, she was running home and she was trying to go back and then she was going to go through it, and he was a married right in the way she was going on, and he said that he was like he was going to get with the other hand and the step off.
He was offered the poetry from the tail and re-in-in-body and the turned it on the page.
And in these cases, the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and intacts but the word, the word, the word to the first word to the first word at the first word to the first word at the first word of the first word for the first word for the first word for the first word to the contrart, the poetry of the poetry and intacts in the poetry of the poetry and intacts
So when I heard it was a crazy -- it's frace, it's exactly the huge.
I don't all my creative process -- I'm not a conducted.
I'm a mult, and my way of work is it is; you see me on the same orary every day and you can get us over the enjoy of the time and go over the enjoy of the same time every day and you can get us over the enjoy of the same time every day and you can see me on the same time and get us over the same time and go over the enjoy of the same time and work is going to be able to work with the same time and work is going to be able to work on the enjoy is; you can see it is to do it
But even I are, in my head and the tuned against that thing, at the time, sometimes.
And I imagine that many of you have hit out of many of you have.
You know, even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain source of it would not be able to be knowing it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to us to do it as we can't get the head, but but what is it going to do with it?
As it really, the best contemporary example I have is the best contemporary musician musician musician in different years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life has been the incarnation of the artist are tormented by control, to control these species of creatiss;
But then he ageed, he got up and one day when she was driving on a car in L.Angeles, she changed all over the light.
He was going to go speed and all of a tra-powerful this little fragment of melodia, which comes into his head as it does inspiration, elusive, you know, wonderful -- you know, sheep, you know, she's wonderful, and the wish -- you know, shouldn't.
It has no piece of card, it has no matched, it has no recorder,
So it starts to feel this kind of old anxiety to him and say, "I'm going to lose and remarrushed by this persembled song with this persemble song,
I'm not good enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to go to the best.
I'll do the whole process of mental process and made something new again.
He just looked at the sky and said, "Hey, you can't see what I'm driving?"
"Do you look like that can write a song nove?
If you really want to exist, it goes back to a more opport when I can get care of you.
Otherefore, you go to to care anybody else today.
You go to disturbing Leonard,
And his work process changed after that.
Not the work, the work even even as it was even dark as a semine.
But the process and the heavy that was released when the genius, the genius, the genius, the genius, the genius, the genius that out of him who was doing it back where it was he was that he had to be interior what they had to be interior and torged.
But he benefited this peculiar co-collaboration bizarre collaboration between Tom and this external thing that was not Tom.
So how much of the story started to change a little bit the way I was working and already I've already saved me a time.
This idea, I save me when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Amae and fall," and you can get in a disperation where we all go when we are working on something and we can't get and you start to think that it's going to be a disaster, which is never writing it will never write about it will be the worst book ever writing out.
Not only brute, just the worst book written a lot.
And I started thinking about the object this project.
But then I remember from Tom who talked about the air and try it.
So I put my face in the hand my face in the hands of a tip corner.
And I said, "You know, you know, both of you, "Do we know that if this book is not going to be brilliant not be bright right now, right?
Because as you see I'm putting all what I have, I have no longer than that.
So if you want to get to you and get you to get you and do your party.
Okay, but if you don't do that, you know what, I don't do it anything.
I'm going to go to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to favor that was recorded that I was in my own participate that I was in the end of course, is -- century ago in the deserts of Africa in the deserts of the dance dance dances of the dance dance dances of the walls to the heat, dances that would go forward and the heba.
And they were always magnificent because the dances were professionals, and they were fantastic.
But every while, rarely, something happened, and one of these artists became actually transmitting it.
And I know that you know what I talk about, because I know you have seen all of them, at some point, a performance like that.
It was like the time it was mass, and the dancing walks through a kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything from the only one of the way and he was going to be able to be hold -- but all you suspects of the way to be hold and was going to get it into the spot, as the 1,000 notes, but all you get to get a different kind of carried with with it.
And suddenly not only appeared as a human being.
But you accepty from diin and under the fire of divinity.
And when this happens, the people knew what he was was, they called it with his names.
They used the hands and started singing, "Allah, Allah, God God God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know,
I was a note of the historic -- when the More invader the Spain the Spain was they predate and the footprint in the century of the Spay -- Olying, "Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, ol," which you can still hear in the famen.
In Spay when a artist did something impossible and magic -- "At the El, Allah, magnified, Gold, uncomprehensible, it's a flow.
And it's great, because we have to do it.
But the problem comes up the next day after the dance, the dances comes up and discovering that are 11 in the morning, and it turns out that 11 in the morning, and the last God is not morning -- there's no more.
It's just a mortal with a lot of male with the knees and maybe never will ever ever ever ever ever ever be able to the height.
And maybe no one will be going to be the name of God still as yet, and what does it have to do with the rest of his life?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most painfful rereconciliations to do in a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angotiated, if you can not be believing, of the most extraordinary thing about your being being being being being from you to yourself.
But I just believe that you have to be data in the unfounded by a founded founds of this team that you have to go to somewhere else when you have.
And, you know, if we think of this whole change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's certainly as I thought about it for different months during the work of the book that I will have been thinking about the most dangerous afraid following my greatest success.
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel elecrid of this is, not having fear.
Let me just just your job. It only does your work.
It carefully representing for your side, any of it.
If your work is dance.
If the divine, I assumpted a kind of decides to leave you some kind of wonderful -- for a few things to get through your efs, then "O!"
Otherefore, you do the same dance.
And "Oh, it!" And you know, the same thing.
I think I think it's got to teach it.
"He!" And the same one, even for the human and testing and tests and testing talks to make you continue up to walk you continue to walk around and test you continuously hadn't knowing the same thing that you can be love, and testing you continually get to you all the way you can get to your own love, even for the skills to be able to get you
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: O!
As you know I've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome -- what can mean, and what about the discovery new set of genes.
We're going to start a new performance of this, we started to get the biology and now starting from that digital code we are coming into a new fassuming of biology, designing and synthesizing life.
We have always tried to ask the questions.
"What is life?" is something that many biologists I think they tried to understand in levels.
We tried a different approach, reducing the mixed at minimes of terms of the same terms of the same terms of the appropriimates of the appropriimates of the same way.
We are digitalizing for almost 20 years right now.
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogic world of biological biological world.
We key to our: Can we can regenerate life, or create new life from this digital universe from this digital universe universe from this digital universe universe?
This is the map of a small organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from the smallest genome between those that can self-self-replicate in the lab --
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one more smaller.
We can eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we give a chance to his metabolic map to the metabolic map to the noaddress at the noaddress at the noaddress to the metabolic map to the metabolic map of the noaddress at at the noaddress to the metabolic map to the
Before me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminate -- one to the time, it's very unlikely that this can bring a vacuum of living cells.
So we decided that the only way to progressive was to synthetize this chromodife so we could modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the adventure of the "Can we can syntheti?"
Can it can be conventing these great molecules that we haven't been able to create before you?
And in a clever affermative, can we make a chromoso?
A chromosome, it's just a piece of chemical material in it.
The speed that we are able to digitize life is growing in a rhythm is growing in a rhythm exponential.
Our ability to write the genetic code, ages, it's going to be slowly, but it's getting improving up.
And our most recently results the leading curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process was required a lot of the past, starting with a bioetic review before we started the first experiments.
But we found that synthetizing DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of the world that make little segments, the moundness of 30 to 50 bes to 50 bear and it's a degenerative process of the most segment is longer than the segment is longer mistakes.
So we had to develop a new method, to make these fragments and regging the mistakes.
And this was our first attemptative, to start with Phi Ta-174.
It's a little virus that kills bacteria kills.
We designed the fragments, effectively the reef, effect and we got a molecules of DNA from about 5,000 liters.
The interesting part of it is when we took this chemical chemical chemical materials and we put it into the bacteria started reading this genetic code and put it into these genius and to produce these virals.
The virals have been released by the cells, they come back and they fall back and they destroyed E.
I talked about recent membrings with the petrolifes that they certainly made this model.
They reaching more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the biggest things in the biggest thing.
We wanted to build the entire bacteria of the bacteria --
It's 580 thousand thousand thousand reading code.
So we thought we could build it in the size of virus, so that we can change the checks so that we can change the comfort of a living cell.
The design is crucial and if we start with digital information in a computer, these must be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the accurateless of a mistakes for every 10 thousand and the extra 10 mile for every 10 thousand basic ws.
We discovered, resequencing it, 30 mistake it -- if we had that original sequence we never had to do it work.
A part of the process is designing segments that are going to be able to all the other segments that are with all the other segments of 50 beings to build little smaller subunits that work together.
We try to project one here.
You probably have to be the bed we put the flight.
Think of it is: We have a genetic code based on four letters -- A, C, Gs and T.
Three of those beings together codifice about 20 adminioids, and there's a specific order of reading for every ammindsets of beings for every amminds.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, frax, you think,
What we did in the beginning was self-to do with it.
Some people have been dolphin from the fact that it wasn't poetry.
We designed these segments to put these segments in order to enciles.
There are enzymes that repaid them and put them with them and assumption.
And we started assembling with the parts, starting with segments at five to seven thousand literally, units, uniting them sitting in a way to make a thousand reading job unites to 72 letter letter to 72 letter letter to 72 letter liter.
But anywhere else we have produced these sets in abundance that we are trying to make a very robotic except that we're trying to create a procedly robed by a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So this seems like the tabellon a basketchet.
When we get these very long, we get these very longer segments -- more than 100 mile mile directly in Eed.
You get to the limite of the modern tools of molecular biology --
So we looked at other mechannels.
We knew another mechanism called a homological recombination of homology, which is useful in biology to repaid DNA to deal DNA in a way of unight mechanisms of the segments.
Here's an example.
This organism is called Deinococcus radiodurans, it can absorb three million rads of radiation.
You can see in the subperior like his chromosomes like his chromosomes are destroyed.
In 12 -- 24 hours comes assembled exactly how it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that have been able to do it.
These organisms can be able to be completely sweleleless.
They have living under empty.
I'm absolutely sure life exist in space, and you get sets to find new rich environments of water.
In fact, NASA showed that this advision is that this avail.
This is a picture of the molecules we built with these processes -- just using the lights of the design chancestry.
The lights it assemble automatically.
This image was not taken with a electron microscope with a regular microscope --
It's a molecules so much that we can see it with a slightly slightly reading microscope --
These are pictures that they cost a period of six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago.
It's about 580,000 beings reads of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecules of a defined structure of the human structure that ever created by man.
It has a molecular weight to 300 million.
If we stamp it with a caratter caratter with a 10-to-space, it would like 142 pages to get this genetic code.
Now, how do we do that? How can we active?
Obviously, you get a virus is a young kid.
It's a little more complicated when you use bacteria as they use bacteria as they use bacteria as they use bacteria as they use bacteria when they use bacteria use when they use bacteria are going to use the bacteria when they use bacterterterteria are coming in.
It's easier even when it's eucarious cells as our ours are the way you can just extract the nucleus and put it another one other, which is basically the process of clonation.
In the archaea chromosome is integrated inside the cell, but we have recently showed that we can do a complete train of a chromosomes from a chromosomes and to active it.
We can refied a chromosomes from a microbial species.
The two are different as men from the topies.
We added some genes in the way we could decide what to choose for this chromosoon.
He then hit it up with enzymes so that you killed all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cells was stupendocked -- and you will open our graphic sophisticatos -- the new chromosomes went into the cell.
And we were thinking we couldn't go to that three, but we tried to get more in there.
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution.
We discovered that a lot of species have added a second or a third chromosomes somewhere, added in a second thousands of new trats traten on the second thousands of trats traten on that species.
So who think about evolution as a gene only gene to the time you make it not understood a lot of the biology.
There are enzymes called restriction enzymes of restrictions are that aditive DNA.
The chromosomes that was in the cells of not a one.
The cell phon-the chromosomes we have inseritos.
And it turns out that and recognized the other way covery chromosome, has mastyed, and we have been retreated, and we have found with just the cells and the new chromo.
It became blue because of the genes we have inserved.
And in a short lasses of time, all the characteristics of a species have gone in a new species, based on a new species, based on the new software we put in the cell.
All the protein has changed, membranes have changed, and when we read the genetic code is the way we have transfted to you.
Now, this could look like genetic alchemics, but we can change things in a pretty substantial things.
Now, I have explained that this is not about genesis -- but progress from three million and a half years and a half of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process of this digital process on this digital process of this digital process of this digital process of this digital process that we are not about genesesis that we
Why do you do that?
I think it's obvious when we think about our needs.
We are to spent six and a half billion people to nine in the next 40 years.
I'm born for an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946; 40 years, there will be four to the planet's four to the planet.
We're going to have problems now to find food, fresh and drinking and drink for six and a half billion people.
It will be even harder to do it for nine billion.
We use more than five billion carbon carbon dioxide than 30 billion barrels of boils.
That means a million barrels a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to remixing them, it's going to be a huge challenge of it.
We need to hold all the emission of CO2 from these materials that ends up in the atmosphere.
On the day, thanks to the scientific discoveries that all over the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the components of designed for the future.
The electronic industry has only dozen on the component about how different different things have come out of it.
Our limitations here are the data that is biological and our imagination.
We have now have some techniques to these rapids sympts, that can create what we call a combinative genomic genomics combinative what we call combinator.
We can build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
Think of processing these 20 million genes or try to get the way to promise the process of trying to produce either either -- we can change, because of a small team, and we can change because of a little team, and molecular biology now that in the past 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard selection section section section section section section section.
We can choose to survive, chemistry or carbon production of glus or carbon vaccines ethc.
This is an instant in some software programmed with some programmed that we're working in to be able to sit and designing species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how they will be done.
We know exactly how their genetic code code code --
Now we're focusing on the carbon on carbon on carbon on carbon on carbon on carbon on carbon on carbon on carbon on on carbon on carbon on carbon on carbon on deal.
You also see you that you can extract ethanol of the gry was a male experiment in the mate experiment in the mate experiment was finished an experiment in the grassroom.
We have carbon depending on the third generation that will be going to be pretty soon from the upper sugars of the higher like the either either like the either or different types of the bottom of the others of the sets of the bottom of the higher generation that will be able to be able to be able to be on the higher generation that they will be able to the higher generation that they will be going to be able to be like the upper carbon on walleper way like the sware or different kinds of carbon on on the
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing impact without increasing the cost of food and limiting the cost of food and the availability, we are working for designing cells that can get this purpose, and we are working for designing cells that can achieve this purpose in about 18 months.
The sunlight combined with CO2 is a methodoc-- but in our discoveries around the world, we found different methods in the world, we found different methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, at about 2,500 feet of the temperature of the water.
It creates meter from CO2 molecular hydrogen molecular as source of energy.
We are trying to understand if we can put the CO2, which can easily be transported through cancer, converting that CO2 in carbon in carbon on and drive this process.
So a short we think we might be able to increase what the question is the basic question that the question of what the life," is that we might remise the whole whole industry.
Right? If you can't do it from TED, where can you can, where can you have?
It would be a main function of energy.
And we're working on the same methods to use the same methods to create the instantaneous vaccines.
You've seen this year with flu flu and we are always backs back to a dollar when it comes to find the right vaccine.
I think that you can change in a combinable vaccines in anticipy.
So that's how the future could start to look change, now, the tree of evolution, accelerating the evolution with synthetic bacteria -- archeucaries, archeucarian cells
We are so so from the way to improve people.
Our purpose is to do a way of living enough to try to do it. Thank you very much.
Before I will show you -- the fastest possible possible possible -- some fundamental work that we have taken to Microsoft to the Microsoft on a year ago -- that's Seadragon. This is Seadragon.
This is a environmental where you can interact with a huge local of visual data that you can remote with a huge amount of visual data --
Here we're seeing a lot of gigabytes of digital photos, and I continue, for a kind of a bread bread, and I have a lot like it.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see is the amount of data or images.
Most of them are common photographs, but this is a scanning scanning from the Biog of Congress, and rewing in the legal of Congress, and rewing in the legal of 300 megapixels.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the reports of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time. It's also a very flexible architectural --
This is a whole book of data that is not imagined by images.
This is Dickens Casa desolate of Dickens. Every colons,
To share to show you that it's about testing and not imagining of it, to see that it is a representation of a representation of the head, not of a photos.
It could be a little artificial way to read a electronic book.
Don't you add the advice of it.
This is a more realistic example. This is a number of The Guardian era.
Every image image is the beginning of a section of a section of a section of a section.
And it really gives you the pleasure experience of reading the cartotoon a magazine version of a magazine version of a fifth of a meeting.
We also did something with the angle of this number in the Guardian.
We created a fasulla advertising require -- much more than the one that you use in a normal publicity; and we put you in the extra-content content in the extra.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile objects, you can see here.
or even specifics or even specific specific that we can do it.
And this really shows some of these ideas to helimining the limits of space on the screen.
We hope that this lady to put the pop-up to the pop and other six, you don't have to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if I don't say that we have contributed to the one in this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. unlike a geost image of NASA geospatial image of NASA HA.
So now we move to something else.
This is actually from the living on the webs; you can go to see it.
This is a project called Photosynthe, which fight two different technologies.
A is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer to do very interesting computing to Noah Snavely, a student of Washington with the help of Steve Seitz US Seitz of the US and Research. A very good collaboration.
And it's from the living on the web, and I managed by Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern that we can go from one image to another and have this kind of solution to the multiple resolution is it.
But the space collection of images here has actually a meaning.
The sets of visualization of computers have recorded these images together, so that they rerespond to the real places where the real real, where the real, all the near Hundy on Montages on Montages of Mountains -- you see all of the elements of a slide-stable slide-stable slide-stable treated slides, and these things are all connected to space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There's some of them much more space.
I want to spend a directly to one of Noah's original data -- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynthosynths that we did the first summer -- to show you what I think is really the chive of the chance behind this technology, Photosyalyth. And it's not necessarily so much evident at the environments we have put in the website.
We had to worry about the woods and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of Nots Dame images Flickr. Basta Flickr. Basta Flickr. Basta Flickr in Flickr and you get images of the camps, and you get some argue that was discovered a picture that it turns out to this model.
So they're all images by Flickr and have been connected to space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple way.
You know, I would never have thought of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratifying this kind of employment here.
I think you can see that this is a lot of different types of fotoams in those SLR, a significant number of phones in this environment.
And if you can get there, I try to look for those hardwane.
Many are blocks of faces, etc.
Something here is a series of photographs -- there it is a series of photographs -- there it is a serious of photographs -- there is a series of photographs -- there you have a series of photographs -- there is a series of photographs -- there is a series of photographs -- there is a series of photographs -- there is a serious of photographs --
This is a poster of Nots Dame recorded right right right right now.
We can go from the physical view of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now now now now is taking data from everywhere -- from collective interacts of how to apt -- and all those data together.
All those photo become connect together, the greater than the summer than the parts.
You have a model of the land land of the entire emerged.
Think about this as a promotion of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual Earth.
It's something that grows in complexity as the people use, and the advantages for who uses the use.
Their photos are marked with meters added inseritted by other people.
If anybody is the idea of delivering all these things say -- my photo the name of Nots Dame suddenly enriches of all those data, and I can use it as a kind of sending point in the space in that space, in that space, in that space, in that metaphor to the photo anybody else, and having a social experience, and have a social experiences.
Of course, a consequence of all of this is extremely elaborate processed virtual processed of every part of the earth -- and the satellite images and the satellite images and similar memory and the websatellite memory of collective memory of the collective memory of all the interesting things of every part of the earth of this is a consequence.
Thank you very much.
CA: I realized the benefit to do what your software going to do is that at some point, in the next few years, all the photographs in the next few years, all the photographs shared by anybody in the world are going to be connected?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing is doing it is doing it is discovered.
He's creating hyperlink if you want to be an imagined.
And it's doing it in the content of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the richness of the semants of the many of these images are possible.
As you do a research of images on the web, you have a fruths and the text on the page, the web has a lot of information about images of the pictures of the photos.
Now, what if that picture you connects to all your picture?
So the amount of semant interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes to it is really enormous classical effect. It's a classical classical effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the pleasure of pleasure when you travel and one of the delipth of the inner research is the way that you have not forget the antic that traditions, the past, the fingery in the wind, the finger in the fabrices.
You know, you think that the monkers still travel the Great Lay, or that the myths of old Way or the myths of meaning, or that in Himalaya, the budying the uniteradication of the Dhar, the budying of the Dhar, and the idea that the world we live in absolutely but the idea that the world we are not in absolutely but it's just a model of reality, but it's just a model of reality,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptative adapts that our stirses has done, good or mal, a lot of generations ago.
And, of course, we all share are tracting tracts.
Everybody nose it.
We are subjects to get re-initiation.
We need to deal with the inesority of death, so we don't surprise and whales --
We all have an art.
What it hits is the rhythm of canoes of every culture.
It doesn't matter that are the Penan forests of Borneo, or the follows of Haiti, or the warrior's deserriors, or the deserrioral of the Kenya secentries of Ancies or a champ in the heart of the Saa.
He was the company in the desert a month ago, or a month ago, or a hallevator of yak in Qomolang, on Everest, the mother of the world.
All of these people teach us that there are other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking about how to move in the world.
And if you reflect, it's a concept that can give you hope.
Inside, the miring miriads of the world creating a spiritual and cultural life that makes the planet and cultural life that makes the planet as the benefit is important for the benefits like biosphere.
And you can think of this ragning cultural as a cultural as an ethnoxfhere and you can define the ethnox, dream of all the concepts, mythishing mitting into being from the imagination of the consciousness of consciousness.
Onthnoxfhere is the fantastic potential of humanity.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in the quisitive species of quisitives.
And because biosphere has been severely consumed as it has happened to ethnoxfast and unfortunately faster.
No biologist, for example, it would say that 50 percent of all the species was or is on the eastern east, because it just is a bunch -- in the field of biological diversity -- in the field of biological diversity -- and you don't have a little bit of the ipotent cultural diversity.
The indicates of all of this is, of course, loss language.
When you're born 6,000 languages on this planet.
A language is not only composing from a vocabulary or a series of rules grammaticalist grammamamain of gragraphic rules.
A language is the price of human spirit is the price of human spirit is the sprap of human spirit is the sprap of human spirit is the sprap of human spirit is the sprap of human spirit is the sprap of human spirit is the sprap of human spirit is the spray.
It's the half of the animation of cultures comes in in the material world.
Every language is a forest of the mind of a swise, a spiritual possibilities.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we are sitting in Monterey, at least half of the time is not going to be sushed in the ears of the kids.
They don't get more teachers to the children, which wants to say, unless you shouldn't get a lot more death.
What is the most sad of being the silence of being the last to talk a language, the last to be the last talking a language, of not to get the sad of the wisdom of anticipate of the kids?
This is a faired in some of the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks a laughter and door and door and door and leading with the last few weeks of a language.
And I know anybody who will say, "Is it better like that?
The world would not be a better place if we were all the same languages?" Benis: then we all talk about all yoruba. We have a lot of yoruba. We have a lot of yoruba. We have a better place if we were all yoruba. We all yoruba. We all yorbe. We all yorbe. We all yorbe. We all yorbe. We all yorba. We all yorbeluba. We are yoruba. We all yoru
We talk about kogies.
You will see a tractive thing that means that you can't talk their language.
I love to do you have to do a journey through the ethnosferam --
a little journey in the ethnoxfhere to give you a assumption.
Many of us forget that when I say "different ways of existing ways of existing in different ways of existing ways of exist.
So let's take an example of this Barasana, in Seponia Sepony Sepentrion the population of anacony, which creates the midden of the midden in the breast of the east of the east in the eastic sacries.
This is a population that is not able to distinguish the blue color, because the celests is identified in the forest time is identified in the forest time of the forest --
They have a strange language and a marriage rule -- said, "Heogamics -- you have to married one person who talks a different language.
And all of this has roots in the mitological past, ality is that in these extremely extreme in six or seven lings, because of the mysters of the mysters of the mysters of no no any any any language.
They are limiting listening and then they start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with the which I lived -- the Waorani of Ecuador nordal, an incredible popular that had the first contacts in 1958.
In 1957 mission dioths have tried to make a mistake contact a face.
They made it from the top photographs that they would rely reported them in a few that they could have loss that this population of rainforest has never seen anything than two-dimensional bi-dimensional bi-dimensional bi-dimensional bi-dimensional bi-dimensional raise.
They ran pictures from the ground, they turn to the research of a form or a shape and not find nothing, they have conclaim that he was treated with the diavold, and they killed five mission with the laws.
But the Waorani didn't kill the foreign as well.
They kill themselves with them.
Fifty percent deaths was caused by their own themselves.
We are risked to eight generations and we found two of natural deaths and when we got to know that one of them was aging with a lot of people who were aging so that it has died again again aging the same thing. Ristheory every one of them had an amazing knowledge of the forest.
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the early '80s, I was assigned a really interesting compit when my professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to intruphage of the power of Duvalized and Tonton Macoutes, and the Tonton Macoutes, and they could get the weak of the veled with the walls of the velation of the velened society.
to make sense of the miraculous mythy I would have to understand the culture Voodoo isn't black is not black hang.
It's quite a lot of a complete vision of the world.
Very interesting thing.
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world, what would I say about it?
Christianity, Islam, Buddisming, etc.
A continent is always left out of there, thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious religious has no religious fts of these very profound religious concepts of these very profound religious concepts of these very profound religious proragic died in the back.
What makes you interesting is the voice is the intention to life and death.
So you live in the spirits.
The spirits can be invocked by the Grande Acqua, respond to the rhythm of the dance and they replace themselves that for a briefly, that for a briefly, the following becomes the dio.
So the voodooisters love to say, "You are white to go to church of God.
We give us in the temple and become God."
And from the moment you are possedumble, is the spirit you guys can you do that?
So you see these incredible events, you follow voice in the state of trances that touch touch tizing tizing tizing tizing demonstration of the power of the mind when you catalized in a state of extreme in a state of extreme extremely quote in the extreme state of extreme in a state of extreme me of the body when you catalized events.
I lived the people who I've lived the most extraordinary of the Santa Santa Marcky Santa Marckrow Colombia Santa Santa Santa secentrional secal.
It turns out that the ancient civilization that once they lived on the careers of the Colombia in the attesa conquist, the population of the conquist, the population of career that you were on the cartoonds of the carbolombic planet's wild on card.
In a mackicated continent, this population has never been conquered by the spagnowles.
And so so today, they are governed by a cline -- but their trained is completely extraordinary.
The young followers are taken by the family to three or four years, and they live in a world of good secreated in a world of good and hombers in the hair for 18 years.
Two years of choices of the nine years of managing degrees of management that spend on the user: they are now metaphorically in the uter's world -- now are metaphor in the Great Mad.
For all of this time, they get accultured to the values of their companies, values that they prehended up and only their prayers -- or cosmic equilibrium -- or to say the ecological equilibrium -- or the ecological balance.
In terms of this amazing initiation, they suddenly brought up and for the first time in the age of 18 years, they see a alba. And in that actime-bating, when the sunsters the sun of the beautiful board, when the sunststers the game -- all that they learned in theory comes conference in all its its own spleter. The prey comes back and says, ""His pass a past of the back of the great landspleth of this is a backwards and says,
"Do you know, like I have detail.
It's stupid. It's now to you protect it."
You call the greatest brothers and say that we we, the threats of the destruction of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think about Indian populations and we meet Rousseau and the old story of wildy wildy of wildy wildy in its simplicity or maybe we invote Thorm and maybe we say these populations in the Earth are closer than the Earth of us.
The indebed indebed is not feeling ners from our days' treatment.
There's no space for these things in the malaric stages of the Tibet, but because of the time and the rate in the geliths of the Earth is not about the concept of being aware of being aware of that, but on a little bit closes: the concept that the Earth can live because it's infuse of human consciousness can live because it's not used by the human consciousness of the human consciousness of the human consciously.
What does that mean?
It means that a girl of Ande who grows that grounds is a mountain is a spirit Apu that will leise his own own fabulous deep and it will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that is a very different relationship with the mountain or that growing a mountain of the mountain or that a mountain of rocks that are going to be taken in the way you are boundarized and it is a founded with a mountain of rock of a mountain of the mountain of rock of rocks of rock of the board of the rock of the roc
which is the dimore of a spirit or a little bit of a mineral core is irrelevant.
What is interesting is the metaphor that define the relationship between the individual and the natural world.
I grew up in the rainforests who were in Britannica creating that the forest and eventually lived to be cutted.
And that made me a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forest are the forest of Hukukukuk and the spirits of the paradies that live in the world north of the world, the spirits that are living at the world of the spirits that are going to live in the Hukukuk and the spirits that they think about the eastern the world that are going to be different at the eastonishing of Hukukukukukukukuk and becutl of the Gars of the Gars of the world of the world of the Gars of the
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually create different reality, you can actually start to understand some sense. We make this plant. We make this plant.
I took this picture of aprile in the nornorthern Amazony.
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuas, the most powerful substance of the chamanic repertoive repertoies.
What makes it fascinating the ayahuass is not the potential farmer of the support, but its processing. It's made by two elements.
And from a hand, this lian list that contives a series of beta-carboline, harmine and mols, harmine and harmine mols, and hard-better.
And then you take the only plant plants a fellow coffee that alters a little bit of consciousness, but it's measured with the leaves of coffee family, the coffee of the coffee coffee is Psychotridge.
This plants powerful poweres that powerful is powerful like the serotonine, methoxyptamine-5, methoxyltryptamine-5, methoxyltryptamines.
If you ever see the Yanomami tiring the nose the replacing supports that make from a different set of species, they are methoxymethoxymethoxyltryptamines.
Tiring that policy on the nose is a little bit like being disappear by a firedunts of boardment paints and land on a sea sea of electricity. It makes a distorsion of reality. It makes the dissolution of reality.
I was often I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who made the psychological fungs in the 1930s in Mexico.
I think my text is not able to classify these triptamines because if you are made not tell anyone to be hallucink -- you can't tell anyone to be hallen in the intamines that can be an extra encnobody who is because they're denaturated monoxidayss.
It's possible to assule just if you put them with other chemicals that denaturate chemicals MAO.
Now it's the beautiful beta-carbols that are inbating, in this lian inbently inbently to potentiate triptamines. The question spontaneous question that is avologizes spontan: in a four-h-death -- how these people are they going to find two dead-defologically not the millions that if you put in this way, believe a white version of the part?
We use the great euphemism of proof of the proof of of the proof infrutting.
But if we ask Indians, they will tell us to the plants of us talking about this."
What does that mean?
This tribes -- the Cof, Cof, Cof, who distinguish nicely in the forest, and that our eyes would come into the same species.
If we ask them how they stabilize their rate rate they tell us how to be able to be able to be stants, the rest of you don't know everyone y?" I said, "No."
The solution is: you take the 17 variety in a night of the full and each one will be able to a different different tone.
With this is not laurea Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to count stams.
Now, [unclear] the problem is that even the ones of us who have heart people who have to get them painting them in the margin but somehow reducts to the marges of the history of our real world and goes beyond the rest of the hamones.
In fact, the X-century, 300 years, will not remind for its wars or technology, but rather like the one of the technology that but rather like the age that we are stopped and we have embracing the destruction of the planet. Now the destruction of biological biological and cultural and cultural biological and cultural of the planet. Now the problem is not change.
All cultures through the century have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians have no stopped being Siouxywrote and free fresh and fresh as Americans have not been stopped being Americans when they put away from the horse and calmity;
It's not the change or technology that threatening the ethnosfera. It's the power.
The flight-fly of domination.
And if you look at the world, you will find that these are not cultures are unculture destined by disappears.
They are living creatures and dynamics, outside the existence of the existence that are beyond their ability to adaptation that are beyond their ability to adaptations.
I'm going to be disboaring in the pathric of the Penan --
a no-made population of Sarawak, in the Southwest aside, a population of the forest to a generation ago, and now reduced to a generation ago, and now reduced to the rivers of rivers of rivers where you can see the riverse of the rivers of the Clim Meria, where you can see the rid Chorneo Chinese Meria, where you can see the navi died the Japanese
and you footprint the staks with the wood subtracts to the forest
Or, in the case of Yanomami, are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the discovery of the gold.
If we move on on the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the hard flip fly of political domination.
As you know the genocide -- the physics of a popular population, but the destruction of a popular universal level, but the destruction of a population of a population of a population, not only not only convicted -- but even celebrated in the environment, because it makes part of the strategic strateury.
And you can't understand the Tibet Tibet until you start to the beginning.
I spent the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Chengdu in Chengdu in Chengdu in a young colleagues, but only came to Lhasa young colleagues, but only got Lhasa statistics that we hear about it.
6,000 monuments sacred in the pole and energy.
1.2 million people killed by military during the Cultural Revolution --
The father of this guy was listed to Panchen Lama.

One day has inadhoted a fasraffed a fasraffer Mao and, for this transgression, it was brought to the work for seven years.
Tibet of the Tibet can be inchance, but the spirit of the population is to be inhold in the population of the tends to be inhand present.
At the end, all you get it reduces to a choice.
We want to live in the world of the monoony or we want to get the policy world policy of different monoth?
The great antropologist Margaret Mead, before we died said that his greatest fear was that, in our way to this amordom vision of the world, not only we're going to see the whole legal of the human imagination in a limited limited limited construction of thinking about it, but a day we wake up as a dimention of mindnine chunk of the way that there were other possibilities.
And it's humiliating to remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolitical revolution that has given us agriculture, which made us satisock in the cult of the seminal classassroom, replacing the proof the cler's specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrialized world has to be 300 years old.
That switch me suggests we have to go back to all the challenges that we have to deal with the millennian to come in the millennian to come.
When these miriads of cultures in the world is asked what it means to be human, they respond to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all risk that all the possibility of being what we are. We are. We are very much a kind of aware that has to make all the populations and all the gardens can trust the giving artical moments.
I took this photo on the north of Baffin the North island when I went to the whales of Inuit, and this man, Olaya, he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather's grandfather.
The canadec government was not always gentles, with the Inuit and in the '50 to be able to our sounds our sounds in colonies.
The grandfather of this man refliked to go down.
The family, I was tempting for his own own and all of his attemptes.
You have to know that Inuit doesn't know the cool -- they don't know that Inuit as well.
The slits of the slits were made of the heaved of the slady of caribs.
The grandfather of this man did not put in the art of art or brought arty, or the bylizartical night or the byond of this man has not intimit or the bunch of the artical night or the bunch or the bywerdness,

We want to talk about horse? [Ris] And that, in different ways, [Applausi] is the symbol of the resilience of the Inuit and all the populations of the world.
In the aprile 1999 government canadese has redded to Inuit in the total control of an area of territory of California and Texas I put together.
It's their new pathria. It's called Navut.
It's a independent territory -- it's a dependent.
One of the splendic example of how a nation-state can reconcilit with his people.
And, finally, I think it's quite obvious at least who of us has been in these remote areas of the planet, realize that there are no remote at the world that are not remote at least in the remote that are not at the remote of the planet, realizing that it's not all of the way of the planet, I realize that they're not remote at least in the remote of the planet, I realize that they're not not remote at least in the remote of the planet,

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book I hope to call other you have already heard and I'll try to deliver some lines, in case not a naren't knockst.
I want to start with what I call "the dog" dog."
What's the official dog?
The official dog's officer of all the Western industrial societial societies, "If we want to mass to be the benefit" -- "If we want to make it is to make it as a way to make it imsemine."
The reason is is that you know, from a side, in the fact that freedom is in itself a value, is for human beings.
On the other one is the fact that if we are free, each of us can account to do everything that mass our benefit without any one that deciding to our benefit nobody who decided in the name of ourselves.
The way to massive freedom is to be massive choices.
More choices people are free, and the more freedom, the more you have freedom, the benefit is their benefit is their benefit is their freedom.
This is a retreatment, it's so deeply deeply in the society that nobody would dream to put it in the doubt in the society that nobody would have dream to put it in the doubt in the society that nobody would have dream to put it in the doubt in the society that no one would have to be able to put it in the doubt in the society that no one would be dreams in the hardbestenge,
And it's also deeply deeply in our lives.
I'll show you some examples of what progress has made it possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big.
I had a simple note on the condition of unhealthy condition for insalate
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions, without content the 10 variety of oil and the 12 balloons of oil and 12 balloes you can buy you to a huge number of consumption in the chest chairs that no one of the one of the one 75 ready ready to be your gradiment of your gradiment.
This is the supermarket
And then you go to the electronic stere: Casses, reader CD, radio, read, reader, radio, plast, the legal legal -- the present CD, radio, plast, the present of the electronic stere: Casslast, reader, the CD, radio, radio, fast, the CD, radio, radio, plast, radio, plast, reader, radio,
And in this single electron store, there's a great number of audio components of audio.
We can do six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in one negoties.
You have to admit that there is a lot of choices.
Some of the trucks the world of communications.
One, when I was a kid, they could get all the services, they could have all the advanced phones, that they were fornes from mama Bell.
He was known the phone, you didn't buy it.
A consequence of that, in the other, was that the phone is that the phone is not a mostly one.
These times are gone.
We have a variety of telephone variety of telephone cell phones --
Here's the cellphones in the future.
My favorite is the one in the middle, reader MPPPPP, and the hidden of the nose crym of the nose crashes.
If you don't have seen it even in the store under the house, you're good trying to get there.
And what the end is the people in the stores of the things in the negod and this question and the question and the question and said, "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much stuff.
So in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water, you mean the same explosion of choices.
Law exsistance. It's not going to happen in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor what you have to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor says, "OK, we could do A, or B" "Well you can do that, "Be's these benefits and these risks and these risks and these risks. What do you want to do?"
You say, "Doctor, what should I do?"
And the doctor says, "A has these benefits and these risks and the Bs has these and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks and the risk says, "Buts,"
"What do you want to do?"
And you rebrought up to him, what to do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not leift."
The result we call the "malat" of malato," expression that makes it a good thing.
But it's not a lot of a moving to move the weight and responsibility to make decisions by somebody who knows something, which is the doctor, to somebody else who knows -- and so it's not not not in the ideal condition to make decisions which is not in the patient condition to make decisions which is the patient of the patient decisions by making decisions of the patient decisions from somebody knows that you know something -- and it's not
There's a huge marketing of drug products of drugs, directed to people like me and you, if you think that if you think it has no sense, that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, why are they public because they were they they pulled them it?
The answer is that they want to domorning, we call the doctor to ask the doctor to make the recepty of changing the reception.
And the thing of so fundamental as our identity is a question of choice, as you see in this factoo. We don't want to force the babies. We don't want to force the right time to the right time. We don't want to get an identity." We don't get a longer identity; we need to invent it.
And we can reinvent, how many times us
which means that every morning -- you have to decide that kind of person wants to be.
And it respect to the family, a time the perspective is common -- and it was that you married the most premise to anybody could be able to do the most premise possible.
The only real choice was with chemicals that chemicals didn't even what to do later.
Orrly, it's all to play out.
I think of a lot of smart, and I do a 20 percent of work in less work.
And because they're not brilliant, not because they're less diliging.
But why are they impossibly asked, I mean, I should I do that?"
"Would I have to marries late? I have to think before the kids or care?"
I'm a logist.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implemented not completing the tasks that you asseat and not get a good voice to my exame.
And they must really ask it. They are important questions.
Now, the work of the work, we're lucky, like Carl underlying in technology allows us to work every day, from the new corner of the planet, except from Hotel Randol.
And in parents, there's a corner, and I'm not going to tell anyone where the WiFi works.
I don't say that because I want to use it.
What means, this incredible freedom of choice we have about the work? It's we have to continue to be decide, and continuously everything, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our boy playing, with the cellphone in a tile tight rate in the other, and the notebook, tipically, a knee.
And even if they're all sorts of the same time we see our boy rolling the headline, we're asking this call?"
"I have to answer this email? I have to emailing this letter to this letter this letter on?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of your boy is a very different experiency from what it would be in other conditions.
So, anywhere we look at all we look at things -- things and style and style of life, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: Ovo, there were some possibilities, but it was not a question of choice.
The world today is the world today, the dilemma is the dilemma is it that it is a positive thing that is you or negative thing.
The answer is Scil answer is System.
The positive side of the positive side of them, so I'm going to talk about the negative side.
All this choice behavior two negative effects on the people.
The first one, paradoxy, is that produces instead of freation.
With many options between the choose, it becomes very hard to do it.
I give you a significant example of this is a conducted on flick.
A colleague had access to the data of Vanguard, the giant companies of pension, with about a million-customers in 2,000 different companies in 2,000 companies in different companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are being offered in more, the percentage of adedession of 24 percent.
With 50 sources, there's 10% in less than degrees when they're available to only 5. Why?
Because with 50 founds in which you choose to the choice is very difficult decider, and choice is remainly hard to the questions.
And to questions, and I still ask questions, questions, and of course, and questions, and of course, they were not going to be making.
You know that not just means that you can just be that these work from the people to dogs because they don't have enough money, it wants to say that decision is so obstate that even the funding founds of the work of the works.
Not participating -- they're losing until 5000-dollar data, which would be good to deal with it.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too much choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally, for finding ethryming: "Wom," or a maine?"
You might just make the right decision if it's for ethothness, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong condition to the wrong condition to the wrong condition
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we can avoid to avoid the paralyside, we're less satisss; we are undabyss from the outcome,
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions between which you choose and you buy one and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine you would have to imagine that you could be better choice that would be better than the alternative imagined us with choice, and the rempise of the choice, and the rempise remitting the rempise of the rempise of decision --
even when it was a good decision.
More choices are easier to disappear with any detail that is unsodly incomfortable option of choices.
Also, there's what economists call the cheap of the cheap of opportunity.
Dan Gilbert closely staking very well stamattines that we talk about things we concerned about what we concerned about.
Del rest, when there are so many options possible is to represent the characteristics of the alternative cars and being less soddisconnected to the option of the option that you have choice.
Here's an example. I took me with all the ones that are not in New York City.
But that's what you probably thought about it.
There's this copy of Hamptons.
A place of luse.
Spilled up splendid. Octima day.
It doesn't lack is nothing to thinking. But what he thinks is, "Well, maledibling."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are alive.
"I could parrowing right in front of home."
And it goes two weeks with the idea that it's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking where you want.
The opportunity costs is decreenable to the satisfaction for what we have, when choice was excellent.
And the more are the options we have to consider -- the more the features are going to come back against opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
It talking about living the moment, and maybe live slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you choose to you choose to not do the others of it.
The things that we don't choose is a lot of attractive what we do.
Third point: the spiral growing of expectations.
I tried it on my skins buy a new jeans.
I was almost always jeans.
Once jeans were just like, you buy them and they were west, they were swest, and they were swest, only after you had them a life and work a lot of times, they started going to go good.
So I went to buy a couple of jeweled when the old people went and said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cutt."
The committed told me, "You want slim fit, relaxed fit, relaxed it?"
Who's wants to the cerniera or with the "Hed" or "acidd."
"Where wants to be rotat?"
"Who wants to be hangers or close? Ble was the bla-up ble -- he was he was will.
I was sancest, and after a little bit of I could say, I I want the kind of chee," that was the only one guy who was so I tried all the malean idea of whildying, and then I came out of the negoties, and then I came out of the negoties, and then I came out of the best jewel, and after I had ever happened.
It was the massive choose I had the choice of the choice I had the better.
But I felt worse
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I I was worse is that with all the choice was my waitative expectations were altism was very perfect.
I was expectations of minimum at the beginning of anything when he was there was only one of the one of it, but when it was a guy had to be perfect.
What I had watched was good, but not perfect it.
After having paragoned that I was trying to incomfortable in confronted confronted to the expectancy.
The adding add options in the lives of people don't make the expectations that these have respect to the options of the options itself.
And this will produce less soddisfation, even when the results are good good.
None in the world of marketing if it makes it content.
Because if you know what I'm talking about.
The truth looks more like this.
"He'd better when he was worse when he was worse when he was worse is that when he was worse that when he was worse to the pleasure of evolution.
On the world we live in -- opulent industrialized citizens with the expectancy of perfeation -- the maximity that we can hope is that things are at the height of the expectancy of expectancy of expectancy of expectancy of expectancy -- the world we live in --
You'll never have been enjoyed because your expectations and my expectations -- my expectations are ingiant to it.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is "Basasassum." "Yeah, you want."
I mean -- a little bit of a fabulous moment -- which is really married and my wife is really stumy.
I couldn't do better, I didn't have to do better, I don't have to do better.
But account is not always a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of buying jeans -- I sweening when you have only that jeans is that when you are not satisfacts, and you ask you "Why?"
Who is responsible?" The answer is clear.
The world is responsible. What could I do about that?
When there are hundreds of jewels of jewels, and you buy a inspectacy, and you ask you who is responsible responsible for you to be your responsible responsible you are responsible you to be in the responsible you are responsible for you to be your responsible responsible for you you to buy a inspect
You could have got better better.
With hundreds of variety available varieties of unsuccess.
So when people get decisions, even though the result is valid, they feel insoddened and they give the hitself.
In the past years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think a significant factor -- not the unique, but important -- of this depression is that people have deludent experiences because the standard are too high at the standards because standards are too high.
And when they need to explain this situation is they think that the hitself is them.
So the final result is that in general we're in better, objectively, but we feel worse.
Let me tell you about it.
This is the official dog, what we all get for good and it's completely fail.
There's no doubdubble that a little bit better choice is better than that you don't have a lot of choice is better than a little bit.
There's a critical value value of it. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have been sure that we have over, the level where the choices are going to make our life.
Now, from political point of view, I have almost finished -- from the policies, the noccile is the following of political view.
What it allows all of this choice in industrial societies is the chealth matters.
There are many places in the world, and you know about that, where the problem is not that they have too much choices.
The problem is they have too much of it.
So the faccense that I'm talking about is a malachieving of modern society in the richest society that Western society.
And what makes you depress and angry is this: Steve Levitt talked to you about how the expensive and seats are useful constants. It's a money.
I mean that these choices, complicated and dispendious, it's not just inutible.
I'm even deleterious to be aditious.
We are worse
If some what people have been in our societies allows so much choice was reverse in those where people have too much possibility, it would not just be the way that you can't just make their life improve and nose the use.
This is what economists call a paretyan improvement improvement
A redistribution of redistribution. It's good to all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in a local choice in a lot.
To conclude -- "Food, you can become what I wanted, "...
Voo, people of culture, they think "What does that make that fish?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a vetrow of wall."
"A fall-falled vision of the world."
and I also got it so I got it so foreign this beginning.
But then, I thought about it, I realized that that that fish the mountain of the long time.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you sent the mouse of the mouse in the way that "everything is possible," you can't get freedom. You get the freedom.
If you break the mouse so that everything became possible to be able to be decrecreated.
You get to get the paralysis, and you get the benefit to wealth
Everybody need a sphere.
This is almost certainly too closed, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic skin, temo, for the infectim, and road for the infecties, and I'm going to be a recipe for the infectiming of some symbolic symbolic symbolic sym
Thank you very much.
