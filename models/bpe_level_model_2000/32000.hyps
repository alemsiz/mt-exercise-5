The last year I showed these slides to show that the artical glacial slide that for almost three million years had the United States of 48 percent.
And this is the floor of the problem because it doesn't show it of, it doesn't show it of the ice ice of ice ice ice --
The art glacial climate is, in a sense, the heart heart of global climate system.
You expanded in the sumer and you get back to the sumer of the summer of the summer and you get back to the sumer of the summer and you get back of summmer and you get back of summer and and you get back to the sumest.
The next slide will be a rapid rapid on the last 25 years.
The glack lost are drawed in red red red one.
As you see it all the way to the blue screen.
That's the ice ice in the winter winter --
You can see that the ice called the glacious glacious glove, five or more, it's like the blood of the body.
In 25 years it's spent from the way, like this.
This is a problem because the interested climate to the art of the art of the art of art where there are huge amount of carbon that sheets that microbies.
Rememployed to the totality of the atmospheric warming from global warming that amount could radicate now.
In some of laka little deep in Alaska deep floor, and in the water.
The professor, Katey Walter of the University of Alaska has recated team a team in the team of the team of the University of last last year.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: Wow! You know, it's good.
A reason is that this exchange that this termal exchange the Greenland the Greenland from the north.
This is a glacial river.
The leved levels that never reached levels like that.
This is the Kangerlusaq, in the south of the Greenland of the Greenland
If you want to know how the level of the sea leveling to the skin the land down here is where the sea level of the sea level of the sea level.
These corrups are increasing rapidly.
On the other side of the planet: Antarcticl, the biggest of the planet.
The month, the scientists have declared that the balance of the ice is in negative negative and that Antarcts, which is particularly running in the submarine, is particularly rapid in the shoot.
Except to six feet level, like in Greenland in Greenland in Greenland in Greenland water in Greenland in Greenland water in Greenlevel.
On Himalaya, the third largest block of ice ice block of glacious gaxiety few years ago were ice and the glacium of ice ice ice blocks.
40 percent of the world's population recovered half the potakeable of the potaken from the shape.
One is Ande: this ice is the founding of water of this city.
The door is increased up.
But when it decrease the same ack water potablins.
In California the neve Sierra Nevada is decrease 40 percent.
The drive of the drivers are in crisis.
The predictions, like you have red, and they're graves.
The growing of the world door to a remarkable audience of incended.
The environmental disasters are increasing a resive out of the normal and without previous previous of the normal and without previous previous of the normal and without previous precedented by the normal and not previous of the normal and without previous precedented by the normal
Four times more number in the last 30 years of the previous previous to 75.
This is a glaction of unsustainable of all the
If you look at it in the history of the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 to 25 million tons of CO2 to 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the area of the oriental Pacific, from America and the west, from America, and on the west, and on the sub-continent in the oceans.
The major global warming, together to the deforestation, together to be the 20 percent, is the use of fossil fuel.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse even worse is even worse even worse
The United States are one of the two countries, together, together.
And it proposed to build a lot of other carbon dial carbon dialt of carbon and proposed to build a lot of other carbon dibon.
But we're assisting a shift of direction.
These are the annulled in the last few years and some alternative proposed alternative projects
At the way, there's a political lotly in our country.
The carbon industries and oil industry have spent 250 million dollars in the last year carbon promoting clean oxial clean obxide oxium.
That image reminded me reminded me a --
Natal, in Natmamal in Tennessee, where I live a 3.8 billion liths of carbon dibon dial carbon dibon dibon dibalt billion liths
Maybe you saw it on the news of the news of it.
This is the second biggest flower of scories in America.
It happened around Natmaine.
The natalized publishing one of the carbon industry was these.
Video: Most charbay is a float and happy happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty carbon is more and more and more cleaner.
It's a good price, loved and workers keep the workers are keeping the stypendent style.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The biggest society on the mountains is Massey Coal. This is the administrator.
Video: Don Bllank: I'm clear clear -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelosii, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Proteon the Proteon of Clima has launched two campaign walks.
This is one of it.
All of the COALery COALery we see the climate change as a threat to our business to our business to our business to our business to our business.
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a broad, public effort and confused the charging truth,
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it is a good fumelt -- it has a good fum.
So not preous about climate change of climate change
Let me do to do it.
Video: All right.
So let's take a gyellow frameworking on a clear structure for clear carbon dialt of clean.
Straordinarily machines are a little roof, but this is the sound of the technology.
The consumption is between the main of the main warming of global warming, but the technology of carbon that you see changing everything.
To look look at the eye of the clean technology of carbon dioximately clean opposed clean eye of clean eye of clean object.
Al Gore: Finally, the positive alternative positive is connecting to economic and the national security and that of national security and the national safety of national security.
Video: Comment: The America is in crisi; the economy, economy, the national safety climate crisis
The filter that colleagues all of the fact that our dependence on the fossil fuels and the importantly oil and the important.
Now, there's a new new audience, you have a new new audience.
Big power America: 1,000 of birth, 10 years.
They plan to stand America to work in America to work safer and help us stop global warming global warming.
Finally, a solution that you can solve our problems.
They America. It bought more.
Al Gore: This is the ultim.
Video: Comment: It's about re-energy to America.
One of the fastest ways to bring the dependence dependence on the floors that kills our planet.
She goes es up here. I mean, it's here. I sole, a new energy network.
She shared 2: Noves investment for places to work well.
All right, Repower America. It's time to be realist.
Al Gore: A old old old African proverbable African proverbable African sun.
If you want to go away together."
We need to go away quickly.
Thank you very much.
The year at TED fect at TED fect in the LHC.
And I promise to go back to the how machine.
So I got it. And for those who the other time you were, the LHC is the biggest scientific experimented -- 27 kilometers of circumstomer circumstomer of circumstomer circumstomer of circumstomer surrounds of cir
His coming to reach the conditions that were under than a billion a second of the universe -- until 600 million times a second to 600 million times a second.
And all this is simply environment.
This is the Gineva.
We photographs Bang Bang Bang inside the relief of these mini-Bang Bang inside the relief of these mini-Bang Bang Bang Bang within the releevers.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's 44 feet and has a 44 feet and has a 22 feet of meters.
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can see proportion proportions.
The 10 seeptember of the last year we access the machine for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was immenses festate in the control.
It's a first image of the first particles that had done all the game, in the LHC, entering collision, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spread particles, and spreading particles,
In other words, when we see that image the 10 settember, we understand that machine work, the machine work, the machine work, which is a great liftye.
I don't know if it was to experience more or about Google and I went to Google and saw that the beginning was this one to Google and saw that the beginning was this one.
That means we had a cultural impact over to that scientific cultural impact.
It was a week later, there was a problem with the machine, and it had to these files here -- these slands here -- these slands -- these sleeps -- these sleeps -- these sleeps -- this is a problem with the machine, there was a problem with the machine, there was a problem with the machine, it was a problem with the machine,
These files taking 13,000 feet when the machine works on the massive powerful.
Now, technicians between you look at the movies and they say, "It's not true. I'm films too underly."
And they can do it because when they're very quickly telling movies become the superconvictors.
So, at less 271 degrees, to a inferior to that space between the stars, these files can bring that corrupt that running is running to the running of the space, and they can bring that corrup.
In one of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a fabrication defection of fabrication of fabrication of fabrication in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the files surrounded up read and 13,000 feet meeting and 13,000 feet meeting a electrical resistance of electrical resistance
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressioning if you think that these magnets are more than 20 tons -- and that came up with about 30 centimeters.
They are damage about 50 magnets.
We had to share yourself, what we did that.
We have repristined and add them and add justed them and add it.
Now they're now returns out all the way to the ground.
Englise the end of the LHC will be new integrated in the big time.
We let it out, and we expect to get the data or him, and keep it or him, and keep it for our wind to find out what the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain four-way faith, these crash the value of science and engineering. It's easy to conft.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think it's the value value of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the words of a scientist scientist of a science science Inuseful Davy, where, in defense of inuteful experiments of his pupll, his clean was a dangerous defense of the human mind of the human mind of the human mind is the deal with the progress of the human mind degress that are defined by the way, that we are not completed in nature, and in nature, which is not about the experiment."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about this, from kids, you play myself, playing matter matter matter burbs.
As you realize them and reach them and reach them and realized them and resolve them and resolve them to think and solve problems and resolve problems and manipulating relationships.
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us.
So, by information informed by the usual objects of our interaction with physics, together to my collaborator Jeevan Kalaniths, I started asking myself, I started asking myself, "And when we use a computer, instead of the mouse as a computer -- that moves up the mouse as a pastre-digital degyal with ent, physically an information with ent, physically an information with an information with both objects of our own own physically information with a hands,
and it to our pleased please?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided we decided we decided we would build the Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a great interactive computer as a birth of discover.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a great interactive computer as a birth of discover.
You can move them with hand, they can see "them" between them, they can feel the right movement and a wireless wireless.
But more of physics, as physics, like matter matter and just to be simply realizing them to be realized with it.
The Siftable is the example, a new ecosystem of tools to be digital information.
And as they get more physics, you know about the motion, of the motion, others, and as they get more physics, and as they are more physics, and as we motion, of the motion, of how we motion, we can explore new interactions of interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show the video -- if you inct it including a direction, the video will go back to the other side back.
These interactive riticians are aware of the others.
If you are them interested in what they are going to be well.
If they are surrounded surrounded and they can agger a bit.
If they are surrounded surrounded and they can agger a bit.
They also have their movement and inclination.
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use of data, as a color, "are" as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated as seck of green and I can use them to go to the colors in the central central color.
and I can use them to go to the color in the central central where they mix they mixed up.
If we can do it too much of it, we can put a little bit of it up.
They're also beautiful to learn as a language, mathematics and play logical and games where people can try things quickly, and see the except of logives you immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacus that I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a word game is half between Scarabeum and Boggly.
Big in the roof, I got a letter to every row Siftl, Pratically, to every turn and you get a house in any Siftable, and as you try to get words of the words of control words himself on a dictionarie.
Then, after about 30 seconds remissing, and you have a new set of lects, and you have a new possibilities to try to try to expect and new possibilities to try to go.
Thank you.
Here's the children came to the Middle Lab, I did in the Middle Lab, I did a video.
They were pleased a lot of them are please.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of education.
You have to say, "The word of the words, and they know exactly what to do.
Here's some other people who try it.
This is our newest matter head, there to the right.
It actually wanted to be mainly implemented it.
It only was a morning, for him.
Now, this is a application of a interactive carton of interactive carton of a interactive carton of a interactive carton application of a interactive application of a interactive application of a interactive carton.
We wanted to build a tool to learn languages in Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new characters, to slide Siftable their associated with their associated associated with their associated associated with their associated with their associated with the Siftable and associated with Siftable and associated the Siftable and associated with their associated with their associated with the sews of the scene, and it can inserve the Se
It can inserve new characters, to slide Siftable their associated with their associated associated with their associated associated with their associated with their associated with the Siftable and associated with Siftable and associated the Siftable and associated with their associated with their associated with the sews of the scene, and it can inserve the Se
So it's doing the sun.
Video: The only is smigene.
David Merrill: He brought a treat the scene.
Video: The treatment is arrange.
By it work!
So schooling Siftable and sets can interact each other, can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing their story.
Video: Caw!
DM: It's a story with final aped, and it can decide how you get away.
DM: It's a story with final aped, and it can decide how you get away.
Video: Vole, you know, the juggled --
DM: The last example, I have time to show you is a tool, recently recently to be a recently detect and music.
it's a tool, realized recently and to execk and music.
The Siftable here is agiss like based on the bacteria.
Each of these has four different variation, and you can choose what it use.
You can inserve these sounds in a sequence to a sequence to your floor of your floor of the floor of the please.
And it just modify it by making a "sound play "a sound sequence."
These are effects that you can control from live, like the reverse and the filter.
I attack a particular sound and then including it into the floor.
And then there are the general effects like time and volum, which is applied to the sequence.
We look at how it works.
DM: We're going to start a base in two Sift-sequence, we start a sequencing sequence, we system, the extend to be a series, and we add other bases.
Now I put a lower line.
Video: DM: Now add the percent of ussion.
Video: I will put the move filter to the bacteria, so I can control effect from living.
Video: I can fast the entire sequence inclining time by a side or one side of the time to the other side.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the movie to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombining the sequence "what."
So I didn't have to planning the first one, but I can improvise, making it more stronger or more corty.
And now, finally, I can get the entire sequence including the entire sequencing the Siftable "volution"
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new interface, building new interface, and more more more more and more more more and more more more and body's brain and body's body's going to see our brains and the body's body machines that are our brains and more more more and more more more more and more more more and
And I had time to show you one of the results of this percording to you one of this percording to the lab out of the lab out of the lab to the lab out of the lab
The concept that I want to transmit you to you have this new generation of objects to interact with digital media that will bring information in our world that will bring information in our world that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a write write.
Soring books is my profession, but more than that, of course, of course,
It's also the love and the love of my life.
And I don't expect that it can change it.
But, I said, something particular was recently successful in my life, and my career -- that he brought me to realibrating the whole realm reported with this work.
The particular thing is that I recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prgia, Ama" -- my previous previous -- for some reason -- and I became a big sensational.
And the result is that everywhere from now, the people who are treats to me as if I was convicted to me as if I were convicted to me.
To -- convicty, convict!
They come from me and they were all worried and they say, "You fear more to be afraid to do better?
You can't afraid to continue write to write all life without any more to be able to create a book that can matter someone who can matter somebody els?"
that can matter someone who can you this?"
It's making sure that you know.
But it could go worse on the worst of the most than 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writtric.
I would met to the same based by the fear reaction of the fear.
And people said, "Don't be successful in the time I couldn't have success?
You don't have you fear that the humiliation of the reject that you kill?
You don't have to do this wide, and you don't fear to do this mestiate and drive on a cumulation of frankled shared with the mouth of falt with the mouth of falliment?"
You know, you know, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is, "Y."
I fear of all these things.
I always had fear of it.
And I also further than many other things that people might not have to it.
As the alga and other spraftling things.
But, as I write about this writing what I thought and I was asked to be ultimly why is?
Is it rational?
And everyone who needs to be expect to be expect by a work that you feel like to do it.
But what is that particular in the impresely creative impreseven to the mental health mental health in a way that other career doesn't do?
How my father, for example, he was a chemistry and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if it was asked to be able if it was walking to be engineer if it had to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer than he was asked to be able to be able to engineer in his fashion the activit
It never was -- that that block of the engineer John, how do you know?
Don't work?
Onestly, the engineers who don't have to be able to the several cutation of course, the reputation of being alcoholed alcohype of maniacs that are maniaged by maniaged by maniagement of maniaged to be alcohypes of the clusters.
We have enough of the reputation, and not only enough writers but creative of all of the general reputation of all sorts of using instable to be enormously instable instable instable in the reputation of all.
And it's not realized that looking at the context of the magnific deaths that are creative in the 20th century, they were young and often for them to hand often for them hand.
And the ones that they don't have suicide seem to be really disagreed by their women.
Norman Mailer, before I did, in the last interviewed in the last interviewed a little more." And I killed a little more deal with with the work of life.
But we don't food, when we feel that we heard these things that are so much about it in some way-interior and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering that the creativity and the suffering and the end, it will always be a thrill.
And the question I want to bring all of the way that I want to bring all of the ide?
It goes you do this -- because it looks at it from a centimeter of me -- it doesn't go to anything this supposed to do about anything this supposed to be a centimeter of the distance of myself to you do that -- it looks like.
I think it's hodiout.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see perpetuated in the next century of the next century.
I think it's better to encouraging our great minds of creative minds to live.
And I know that in my case -- in my case, in my case, it would be very dangerous to that feeling towards that I would have a dangered wall of the circumstances where I'm in the career.
Of a -- insome, I'm quite a young young -- I about 40 years.
I still have about four decadecadecades in me.
And it's very likely to be write that whatever write in the world as the work that he used to be judged after the work that was a very success of my last book.
I'm going to be skying, because we're all more or friends here -- it's likely to be a best friends and my greatest success is to my spas.
Oh, Gesus -- that thous!
You know this is the kind of thinking about the person to start a person to start drink holds to the nine morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would keep doing this work that we are.
So, the question become about?
And so it seems to me after a lot of reflections, that the way to work is to create a psychological cooling psychological cool, okay?
I have to find a distance of safety among I am write, and my natural natural reaction of the anks that I written E, as I was trying to get E, as I started to look through the time to look through the time that we start to look through the time that we can have more other societies to see if they could have more society to see if they could have more more societies to see whether they could have more more more societies and healthy to see if they could have more and more more more society than the way to see if they can have ideas to be able as a deal as
about how to help people create people to deal with inerents of creative emotion.
And that research and the ancient research and Roma.
You skemitems because it turns out to the slight back.
In the ancient Greea and the ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity came from humans, OK?
And it was thinking that creativity was that they look like, and that came to the wine and that came to men from a few surface and unknown, for distant and unknown.
The greater of these spirits of the creatians of creativity "demons."
Socrate, wonderful, wonderful, of course, he believed to have a demon wisdom.
The Romans were the same idea, but they were called the kind of spirit without body's body a genius.
The thing is great -- the Romans didn't really think that a genius was someone particularly smart.
They believed that a genius was this kind of a kind of sentity that he believed living in the walls of an artist, a little bit like Dobby, and that came out of the Dobby, and that was the work of the art and modeling the outsult of that work.
Exctional -- et, that's the distance of the distance of which I talked to -- that psychological construction that you protect you from your work.
And everyone knew that was so that it working, right?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things, like for example, right?
If your work was exceptional couldn't get all the market, everybody knew that was helped by this genius.
If your work work failure, it wasn't all your own floor, right?
Everybody knew that it was your genius to be a unable to be a inability.
And so people han conceived creativity in Occident for a long time.
And the Rinasciseed and all of the change, and the great idea; we put the huge human being; we put the human beings and the mysteries and no longer and no longer and no longer and without leaving space of the divinity.
This was the principle of the rational humanmanity, and people started to think that creativity creativity came from the idu.
And for the first time in history, it began to refer this or that artist as a kind of genius as a rather than genius with genius.
And I must tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think that allowing someone, a very simple person to believe being like a recipe of being like the foundation, and the surgery of all the people who are creative and ethernal and ethernal and ethernal responsibility to be a film that we can get to human fragile fting human fragile --
It's like to ask someone of the engineer to ask the sun.
It shape and it's completely the ego and creates all these expectations on the performance.
And I think that was this pressure to destruct artists in the past 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think it is, and I think, and now?
Can we do it different?
Maybe I go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and creative mystery creative to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystered to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and creative across the more of human relationship between human relationship between human relationship of the relationship between humans and creative action.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we cancer in a room of rational thinking, in a 18 minutes.
And you probably have people between the audience that would suspects of scientific suspects of scientific notion that they follow people are following their projects.
I probably don't convinced you all on this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why is?
Why don't you think it in this way?
Because it has more sense than any other thing that ever heard to explain the exasperant impredictabled to creative process of creative process of creative process.
A process that as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so much fundamentally, everybody here -- yet you don't get rational.
And, in fact, it can sometimes that seems completely paranormal seems completely paranormal seems completely bad.
I did this meet with the extraordinary poet Ruth Stone, who has 90 years, but it was a poet, and it was a poeter for all life and he told me that during his surface in the survey of the round Virginia, and I feel him was the poem of the landscape.
He told me that it was like a fragorous fragorous rain.
And he came rolling to the landscape.
I heard it turned out, because he had to get the land underneath his feet.
He knew that that he knew to do to that point and he was like, "to run how a morn."
And it turned to the home and it was following up in this poety; it wouldn't be a piece of paper and a fairly house and a fairly house it and the translated and it on the page.
Other times couldn't be fast, and he could go fast, so correced and correcked out and the rolled rolled the rolled rolled through the lands and she would keep roten through the landscape, and she would continue to roll the landscape, "another poet."
And there were those times -- this piece never forget it -- there was a moments that was almost losing the time that was almost losing almost losing --
So, he was running home and he was looking for the card and the poetry went through and he was going through a mathematic, and he was going to be a matheme on the other hand and the engineer and the off.
He was the poetry poem from the coda and the reputs in his body and the page.
And in these cases, the poem would be presented on the perfect page, but in the last word on the last word on the first side word on the first major against the first one --
So when I heard -- it's crazy exactly the same as a creative process to my creative process to my creative process to my process process to my process process to my process process to my process to my process of creative -- it's exactly the grid of my creative process.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a mule, and my way to work and my way to see it is, I can see me at the same hours every day and souldn't get it up and go up and go on the goods.
But even in my head, I was a text against that thing, at the time.
And I imagine that many of you have a lot of you have han done.
You know, even if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas I gave you a certain foundly source.
What is this thing?
And how can we relate to the head, so that we don't lose the head, rather than hold us sam?
So I was about about it, the best example, the best example, I have the Tom Waits, which I interviewed different ago for a day-day --
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life was the artist of the artist of contemporary artist to control, and dominate these kind of empulses of creative impulses of creative interior.
But then he was driving and a day he was driving on the highway to the Los Angeles, he changed all for him.
He was going to fast and all of a feat that small fragments of a melodia, which comes into his heads as the inspiration, elusive and the wish and the wish wish and the wish wish and the wish wish and the wish wish and the wish wish and the wish of it.
It has no piece of paper -- it has no mathemity, it has no recorator.
So it begins to feel this kind of old old old old old old old him, "I'm going to lose and I will get hoxisioned by this song.
I'm not quite good enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to go to the panic panic --
And he did the whole mental process and he did something new completely new thing.
And he just looked at the sky and said, "Scuse, you can't see that I'm driving I'm driving do?"
"You seems that it can write a song now?
If you really want to exist, you know, you go back to a little more opportunity when I can get care of you.
Altries, you go to matter someone else today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process working on the job.
Not the work was still dark as it seeds to be able to do it.
But the process that the fish floor that was released when the genius was released when the genius was going to be a very problems and remained it from the other problems and remained it from where it was a whole thing and I was going to be an interior and back back back to the mind.
but well-culiar piece of well, wonderful bizarre collaboration a conversation between Tom and this strange and external thing that lost was Tom.
So I felt that story began to change a little bit of a way I was working and I was already saved a time.
This idea, saved when I was writing "Mangia, Prgia, and I fall in one of those of the disperation where we are working on something and we can start thinking about something and we can start thinking that it will be a worst book.
Not only bad book right written --
And I started thinking about designing this project.
But then I remember Tom that I talked to the air and try and tried it.
I stand I stayed my face on the handling and I would say, my comments to a angle of the room of the room room.
And I told you, "You ent, both both both you know that if this book doesn't be brilliant not going to be brilliant, right?
Because as you see me all I haven't been seeing anymore.
So if you want to be better and you have to be a little bit and do your parts.
Okay. But if you don't do it, you know, I don't know it, you know about it.
I'm going to write the same because my work.
And I would like to flew that I today I today is I presented to me to do my part, because -- the end is -- the end of the Africa of the North Africa -- se-several in the Africa of the dances and sacross the dances and sacross the sacred and until hours and the today to the hours and the floor and the until hours and the floor and the today until the fle-up and the favor and the floor and the flew and hour,
And they were always magnific because the ballers were professional and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic fantastic and they were fantastic and fantastic and they were fantastic and fantastic and they were fantastic and fantastic
But every one of the fact that it was going to be a transcending artists became to reality translent.
And I know what I know about what I know about it, because I know that you view everybody, a performance there.
It was as if you stopping and the dang walking through a kind of laptop, and it wasn't doing anything different from the usual -- but all of alleny.
And suddenly not appeared as a human human human --
But it turns out to the deline and underneath the divinity of divinity.
And when this happened to the them, the people knew what it was, they were called his name.
They had hands and they started singing, "Ah, Allah, Do ah, God, "Oh, God, God,
That's God, you know.
And he note the south of the South the Morors of the South Spne, this habited with them and pronunced their own and pronunced by "Allah, Allah, Allah, and the "Oh, Allah, who's stay or flower corrides or in the flow, the flow,
In Spain, when a artist made something that was impossible and magic -- "Oh, oh, oh, oh, bad, you know, I brought -- a floor -- a score," an unknowable, except -- a floor --
And it's great about why we need it.
But, the problem goes on the ballery ballery itself, when you wake up and discovers that are the 11 morning, and the God is not morning.
It's just a mortal death with the knews and maybe never be able to achieve more to the high high at that high high height to that allow.
And maybe no one will be the name of God while it's still to do it with the rest of his life?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most driwellest dolorous real-like creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so anguy if you can not believe -- if you can not believe it, in fact, that the most extraordinary expects of your being as you can come from you to yourself.
But it believed you that you have data in the instanced by a squisite part of your life that you have to go to someone else when you finished.
And, you know, if we think in this way way.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought for different months during the book, I think, about a book that I'm going to public book -- the dangerous speaking, the dangerous charge of my great success.
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electrical feeling on this is, not afraid to be afraid to be fear --
Don't short your work.
He slighten to presenting you to your parts, whatever it can be.
If your work is ball, dance, dance, dance.
If the drive that the drive to the draw of leaving some kind of wonderful things, for a moment through your effort, and then "Ole!"
Altries, you do it the same dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself.
I think it is to teach it.
"Ole!" to yourself, just for yourself, just for human and heading to the human and head.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
And you know I already know about some of these projects on human genome genome of these projects on the discovering new genes.
Now we're starting a new floorse of it, we started to degyzing biology and now to go from that code code from that code code and now we are entering a new phase of biology, designing and synthesizing lives.
We always tried to bring big questions.
"What is the lifes?" is something that many biologists I think they tried to figure out how to various levels.
We tried different approaches, reducing it to the minimes of terms
We're digitalizing by almost 20 years old.
When we sequenced the human genome was going to go from the analogical world to the digital world,
Now we ask us, can we regenerate life, or create new life from this digital universe from this digital universe
This is the map of a small organism, the Mycoplasma paritalium, which is the smallest species that can authoreplicated in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more than a little bit of a little bit more than that.
We can be able to eliminate a hundred genes of the about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the metabolic map, it's relatively easy to the nows.
I read up my own -- this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimind, one to the time, it's very unlikely to bring a living cell.
So we decided that the only via to progress to progress in a progress so that we could modify the components to the components to the components to some of these foundings.
And so we started the wind of "We can synthesize a cromoun?"
Can chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never got to create before that?
And, in fact, we can make a crumosound?
A chromosome, it's just a piece of chemistry chemistry of chemistry chemistry is just a piece of chemistry chemistry of chemistry chemistry is just a piece of chemistry chemistry piece of chemistry chemistry is just a piece of chemistry is just a
The speed that we are able to degyze the life is growing up to exponential exponential that we are able to deal with exponential that we are able to dealing with exponential rhythm that we are able to degyze the life is growing up to dealth.
Our capacity to write the genetic code of genetic code of it, but it's better about.
And our most recently results results the brand a exponential curve.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has requires a lot of passing and beginning with a biothic revision before we started the first experiments.
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult.
There are decades of thousands of machines in the world that produce small segment of DNA, the longer than 30 to 50 labor and it's a degenerative process is longer than the segment is longer and it's a lot of degenerative machines are abled longer than the segment of machines and it's a degeneration process of
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct the middle and rors rors.
And this was our first attempt to particular information from the digital information genome of Phi X 174.
It's a small viruses that kill bacteria.
We designed the fragments, effects of errors and got a molecule, and then we had a DNA for about 5,000 letters.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemistry and we put it into the bacteria and we put it into the bacteria started reading this genetic code and producing the genetic particles.
The virals are then released by cells, they were released by cells, and they destroyed Els.
I talked about recently with recently members of the oil industry says that they try to understand that they try to understand this model.
They have more than that.
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build the same hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things more in big.
We wanted to build the whole batterie.
I'm 580 milar genetic code of genetic code of genetic code.
So we thought I built it in the size of virus, so we could change the scale of virus, so that we could change the cassets to understand what the living components of a living cell.
The design design is crucial information and if we start with digital information in a computer, these are must be very accured.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the accurateful standard was a mistake for every 10 miles baside.
We found out of the original sequencing, 30 errors. If we used that original sequence, we would never be able to do it work.
One part of the process is to designing along to 50 letting that you get to all the other segment with all other segments of 50 letters to build underunit together.
We do it objects here.
You probably read that we read that we read about the filight that we read the filight that we read to the filight that we read to the filight that we read about the filight of the filight of the filight of the filight of the filight of the filight of the fill.
Think about this way: we have a genetic code genetic code on four liter: A, C, and T.
Three of those letters together with about 20 friends of levels and there is a specific order to put every adminoacid for every adminoacid of lects,
So we can use the genetic code to write words, though.
What we did in the beginning was automo-the-the-the-away.
Some have been deluses from the fact that it wasn't poe."
We designed these segment segment to just just building with the entire segments.
There are enzymes that repaid them and they put them together.
And we started assembling the parts, starting with five to seven thousand liters, and it segment to form 24 miles of lectape 24 mile lects, and it turns to seven the liters.
At every drive we produced these segments in abundance so that we can sequenced by creating a extremely robbbrobuster -- how you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatizing the process.
So, this seems to be the folks of a basket.
When we get to these very longments, more than 100 miles, more than 100 miles -- they will not grow more directly in the E.
It comes to the limited tools of the molecular biology biology.
So we looked at other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called "recombination of a homologists that in biology to repair the DNA to repair seats.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiodurans, can allower three million radiation of radiation
You can see in the high school, as his cromosomes that it comes destruct.
In 12 -- 224 hours is reached exactly as it was before.
They have thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be completely sect out of the time.
They can live under the well.
I'm absolutely sure that life exists in space, and you moved to find new environments of water environments of water.
In fact, NASA showed that this availing that this avail.
This is a molecular image that we built using these process, just using these process, by using the lievised design appropriate to inset up the segment of segment to inset up the size of the molecules that we built using these process, which we built using the lievised image of the molecule that we built using these process, which is
The lievised automatically.
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope with a microscope microscope microscope microscope with a regular microscope.
It's a molecules that we can see it with a microscope with a lawer.
These are photograph that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the advertising that we did a little time ago.
I'm 580,000 lects genetic code genetic code of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecules that never created by the man.
It has a molecular weight in 300 million of them --
If we walked with a 10 paper, without 10 pages without spaces, they would just get 142 pages this genetic code this genetic code of genetic code of it.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we activate it?
Of course, you track a virus.
It's a little more complicated when they use the bacteria.
It's also simpler when it comes to the eucariot of the eucariot as our reals, you can simplest to be an other, which is practically the process of clonation.
In the bacteria the archaea the chromosome, it is integrated inside the cell phone, but we recently demonstred that we can do a complete cromosome.
We can have a shrimp of a partment crumosome.
The two are different how men are fun from the tough of the tough men are drivers.
We added some genes in more way that I could decide what you choose to this chromosom for this chromoth.
It turns out to kill all the proteins.
And when we put in the cellum in the cellphone -- and you appreciate our softwice -- and you appreciate our softwo-stick cell phone.
And we started thinking we couldn't go over there, but we tried to go over there.
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third or a third of some away from the other hand, in a second thousands of new tracks to that species.
So who thinks about evolution as a gene to evolution as a gene that it has not understood part of the biology.
They have DNA. They are called "restrial restranding of DNA.
The chromosome, he was in the cell that it was in the cell that it was in the cell that it was in the cell that it was in the cell that it was in the cell phone.
The cell phona-to-cromosomes that we put it out.
And it turns out that the other crum, and he recognized the other hand, and we found with only the cell and we found with only the crum.
it became blue to the genes that we put genes that we put in.
And in a short of time, all the feature of a kind of a species are gone lost species, and it turned out of all over the new species, the new software so that we put in the cellphone.
All the proteins have changed it, the membranes are changed, and when we wood the genetic code genetic code of what we transfer is what we transfer to you.
Now, this could seem alchemiia altery but altering the software DNA we can change things in the fabulous enough of the finger-enough software like genetic.
Now, I explained that here is not about genesis -- but to progress from three million years of evolution, and I said that maybe we're making a new version of the explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of new species on this digital process of the degital process of the digital process of the genesy of this degyal process of the genesis that maybe we can do a new version of the genes
Why do that?
I think it's enough obvious when we think about our necessarily necessarily
We're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give example, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each other existing in 1940 years, there are going to be four.
We were having problems now to find food, water and clean water and bashion, clean and gased drugs and a half billion people.
It will even be more harder for nine billion billion --
We can get more than five billion carbon dibon of olix.
That means a million barbels a day.
When we try to find biologists, or any kind of process to re-piece process to re-pirate and a challenge chally.
We have to keep the whole of CO2 emission of all of these materials that finished in the atmosphere.
At day, thank you to scientific discoveries around the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the designed components for the future.
The electronic industry has only a dozen dozen of components, and think about how many different things came out.
Our limits here are main reality by biologic reality and our imagination.
Now we have techniques, thank you very quickly in these synthesization, in able to create what we call genomics combinatories.
We can build a big robots that can build a big romosomes that can produce a million chromosomes a day.
Think of a process of process of these 20 million genes or drugs, or to try to get the process to produce or drugs, new vaccines, we can change and make more biology and create more biology and create more biology biology and create more biology science.
And it's just a standard selease.
We can choose for chance of survivors, chemistry or carbon chemistry or carbon getc.
This is an instantly some software programmed with some software programmed to be able to seat us and designing species to computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they will be no.
We know exactly what the genetic code.
Now we're concentrying on the urant carbon of fourth generation.
You see that you can see the ethanol from the grand was a finished experiment experiment of the way.
We have a second further and third generation that will use enough purants to be pretty much more value than the highest person as the eight types of butanol.
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without major impact the food of food and limiting the food of food and the disease, which we're working on the CO2 in matter than we are working for cells to design cell that they can reach these things, and we think we could reach this discovered the first of a 18 months.
The sunlight with the CO2 is a methodom -- but in our found out in all the world, we found different metods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean deep about 2500 feet deep feet of the water temperature of the water temperature of water.
It put from CO2 using by CO2 using molecular energy source of energy.
We're trying to figure out whether we can be a CO2, that can easily be transported by text tracks, to drive that CO2 in carbon to drive this process.
So short we think we could increase what we could increase what the basic question, "What is the life" is Not -- and we have the dest goal -- we have the goal of oil oil industry the oil industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do that?
It would become a main of energy source of energy.
Inoless methods to use the same methods to create vaccines.
You saw this year with influence, we're always backward a year and a dollar and a dollar, in less when it comes to find the right.
I think that that that it can change building vaccinable in an anticips.
Here's how the future could begin to be changing, now, the evolutionary tree of evolution, acceling the evolution with synthetic bacteria and indeed cells.
We are so much from the best people.
Our purpose is to live enough to try to live enough to try to do it very much.
First of all I'm going to see the most quickest possible work that we brought to the Microsoft in the new technology that we brought to Microsoft in a year ago exactly a year ago.
It's a environment that you can interact is the local levels that remote with a huge amount of visual data --
And we're seeing a lot of gabyte photographs with a kind of digital footom and continuous for a panoramic, avaking the images as we want to do this images as we want to do.
And it doesn't matter how big we see how big information that we see it, how big we see that it's great of these data or images.
Most of them are common photographs but this for example, it's a provenious scansion from Bilibrary of Congress, and he comes into the gamm of 300 megapixel.
Not a difference because the only thing that limited the prestations of a system as the number of place in any time. It's also an architecture in any time. It's also an architecture almost posely flexel of it.
This is a whole book, example, of data not imagines.
This is the Dickens. Every Casa Dickens. Every colon's desolated a capitol.
To show you that it's just about text and not imagine, we can do something like this, to make a thing, to make a representation of the text representation of the text of the text of the text of the text of the text of the text of the textbook, you can do something like this, to show you that it's a picture.
It could be a little artical way to read a electronic book electronic book.
You don't recommend it.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian net of the Guardian news.
Every image is the beginning of a section.
And it gives you pleasure and the beauty experience to read the version of a net read or a net of a quotidic review or a lot of half a lot of half a lot of half a lot of half a lot of half a lot of half a quirt.
We also did something with the angle of this number of of the Guardian Guardian Guardian with the Gardian angle of this number of of of this number of of the Guardian angle of this number of of the Guardian angle of this number of Guardian.
We created a high advertising high resolution -- much higher than what it used in a normal advertising in a normal advertised content -- and we put you in the extra.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the techniques.
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space.
We hope that this means to put pop on the pop and other ckets and other ckick and other clear charge.
Of course, the maping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have contributes to be giving in this field.
These are all roads in the U.S.
So now we go to something else.
This is actually from the webs; you can go to the webs; you can see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which is a two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research of computers in Noah Snavely, a student of Washington, with the Steve See Steve See See Seliskski Resear. An Rear. Aahi Rear. A-U.S., and the other collaboration.
And it's from Seadragonon-web, I was vive in the web,
You can see it when we do this kind of screen that we can go from one image to the other image on the other and have this kind of multiple resolution to multiple multiple resolution --
But the space of the images here has actually actually actually a meaning.
The algorithms of visualization of the computer recorded these images together, so that they can correspond to the real imagine, and all the real sheets that imagined -- all the neighbors in Montags -- they were taken -- they were taken -- they were taken a chanadies of a slide-show show of imagining panoramic image of a space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some more space than it is a lot more spacal of spaces.
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noah-hot Photosynynthosynynthosynynth-scoring scoreful -- to show you what I think is really clearly the clear technology -- Photynth. And it's not necessarily expect the environments that we put in the web.
We had to worry about legal aspects and saying it.
This is a rebuilding in the Cathral's rebuilding by Flickr. Basta digym, and Dame in Flickr. And you get images of the types of the field of the field of the field of the field of the field of the represents a picture that it's a image that it's set of the model.
So they're all images Flickr and they were all colleged in the space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never think I would never think of it ended to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratify to receive this kind of active acres here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of fun fun of fun fun of the phones that are cell phones SLR, a meaning number, a meaning of significant environment.
And if you can try to go to the strange the strange of the strange to look for those strange strange.
Many are they blocked by down, etc.
Of here is a few of photographs -- execkly.
This is a Notre Damam's poster correcorrect of court.
We can go from the poster to the poster physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment. This is taking from all of the whole memory of visual as the Earth, the visual point of visual data together.
All of those photographs become connected together, the major of the same.
You have a model of the land that is emerge.
Think about this as the modeling of Stephen Lawler on the Earth
It's something that grows in complexity as people using that people use, and the vantages for who use.
Their pictures are honto other people.
If you get someone is the idea of contrashing all these several sands says the name of Notre Damimproved suddenly recognized all of the data, and I can use it as a point of engine, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, using the space, using the photograph of anyone else, and have a social experience of a skype and cross-user.
Of course, a consequence of all of the things are virtual models of all interesting in the land, by the way, doesn't just just from the planet -- not only by the planet and similar, but the memories and similar, but from the collective collective virtual model.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Is it figured out what your software is that you can do is that at a certain point, the next years, all the photographs shared by everyone in the world will be practically colleged together?
BA: Yeah. That's what it's doing is doing is actually discover.
Shyperlin, if you want to hyperlink in images.
And it's doing it in the based on the contents.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think of the information of information that many of these images can education images that many of these images can education --
As when you do a research of images on the web, you told a and the web on the web page, has a lot of information about photos of photos.
Now, what if that picture is connected to all your picture?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of real-like real-like reciless of the retasy of the network.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the main of the major when you travels and one of the ethnographic research is the power live between who has no anti-traditions, between the wind, the touch of the plant -- the drivers of plants.
Basti to think that the samans Jaguar is even over the Mily Waya, or that the myths of the ancient Inuit is still listed me or that in Himalaya, the budhold-stand the idea that the central respirit of the anthropologia, and that idea that the world we live in sense that the world we are not existed in a sense of reality, but it's just a model,
the consequence of a particular choices that our stirps that our stirps of adaptation that our stird generations ago.
And, of course, we all share essential trath of essential tratics.
We all all procreated.
We are subjects to begin the action of the beginning.
We have to deal the inexority of death, so we don't surprised us and ballim --
all of we have an art art.
What it hit is the very sharing is the very particular song, the rhythm of every culture.
Not matter to the Worl, or the Borneo, or the following Haiti, or the Haiti, or the Kaisut in Kaisut in Kaid in the Sahara.
He was my journey companied in the desert of yak in yak in yak in yak in yak in the world.
All these people teaching us that there are other ways of thinking about thinking, other ways to think, other ways to think, other ways of thinking, other ways of move in the world.
And, if you reflect a moment, it's a concept that it can give you hope.
Teem, my miridge of cultures create a ragnader and cultural life and cultural cultural and cultural to be the planet and it's important for the well-being of the planet so as biosphering biofer.
And you can think about this rather cultural as an ethnos: an ethnose and you can define the eth, the etho-to-op-to-total -- myth, dreams, myth, intuitions in being from human alba consciousness of the consciousness of consciousness and the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of all the concept of the concepts of all the concept,
The ethnos: The fantastic remonugly real-
It's the symbol's and what we can be in a kind of inquisist that we can be in a species.
And as the biosphere was floored high-re-like floor, as it happened to the etnose and purposes to the etness rapidly.
No biologist, for example, it would say 50, it was about 50th is the hours of all the way of extinction -- in the most apocality, the apocalthics -- in the most of biologic diversity -- and not near wer -- the most optimistic diversity -- that of the cultural diversity cultural diversity -- that of the cultural diversity -- that is the most of the cultural diversity -- the way of the biologist,
The indication of all of this is, of course, the perdity language.
When you were born there were 6,000 languages on this planet.
One language is not just by a vocabolary or a series of rules of rules of rules makers.
One language is the human spirit of the human spirit of spirit of human spirit spirit of spirit spirit of human spirit spirit of spirit of human spirit spirit of spirit human spirit spirit.
It's the mean with which the animation of every culture comes into the material in the material in the material.
Every language is a forest of mind, a wind, a thinking, a thinking, a thinking, a spiritual system.
And of those 6,000 languages, while we are here sitting here in Monterey, at least half the half of children.
They don't go more teached to children, the ones that it means not not cambs something, which are already dead.
What is more than the sader than being fle-floloved by the way, to be the last type of the advanced wisdom of advancing the wisdom of children?
And I did did this is the state of someone in some part of the world every two weeks: every two weeks a dioxillabes and with the last few weeks of a anguy anguy's wind language.
And I know someone you say "Isn't it better like?
The world would not be a better place, if we were all the same language?" Bensyny, then we talk yoruba. We talked him. We talk about the yoruba.
We talk kogi.
Scovered networks of a tract thing that you can not talk about your language.
I would like to do a journey through the etnose of the etnose --
a little journey in the etnose of what we're losing is that we're lost.
Many of us forget that when I say "different different ways of existing existing exists of exists of exists of existing exists.
We take for example, this birth Barasas, in Amazon sector, the popular anaconds, which creates the milk of the west to the milk of the west sandwills of the west sandwalks.
It's a population of a popular that it's not able to distinguid the blue cabled blue color, because the celest, the population of the forest, from the well.
They have strange language and a mathematic, "examy languagotic examy language, you have to a person who talks about a different language.
And all of this has radicated in the mythological past, all the way of the particularity is that in these families are talking about six or seven languages to be a language.
They listening to listening and then they start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived in the World Worans of Ecuador Ecuador who had the first contact in 1958.
In 1957 missionaries have tried a connected contact of a fact that they had a fact that they had a fact that they had a fact that they had tried to be a fairly commit misionary mission of 195.
They made up from the high floor that they were reached that they were reached friendled that this population population had never seen anything in the plug of plug forest had never seen anything about bi-dimensional bi-dimensional photographs that were reaching amice.
They collected the foots from the land they knew that they turned to a shape or a figura -- and they kill out of the diavole, they killed the diavold, and they killed killed the five mixsionary with the lances.
But Waorans didn't kill foreign the strangers.
They knew between them.
Five percent of mortality was caused by them st.
We were risalited to eight generations and we found two natural death and when we insisted for knowledged that one of them was aging that one of them was dead, and then they killed it killed him itself. And then they killed it killed it up.
The cactors were able to recognize the animal 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the first '80s, I was assigned a very interesting comfortable when my professor Harvard professor Haiti to intrupholared to intrupholarms to the based on the power of Duvested the power of Duver and TonMacoutes and TonMacoutes and Tonombs.
To give a sense to the miraculous culture Vodouble culture Vodouble culture and that the Vodough is not nera.
It's pretty much of a metaphaphysics of the world.
Very interesting.

So you live the spirits.
You know, you walk from the Great Aca, the Great Aque, they answer the dance of dance and replace it to the dance of the way that for a short that for a short fast.
So you have to say "You white love white a white church to talk about God.
We damage in the temple, and we become God."
And as you can do it you've got to you, is the spirit that you drive you,
So it looks at these incredible events of these incredible events of trance in the trance that touching points that touched a rather forward of the power of the mind when it was catalyzed in a state of extremely excited in a state of exciting exectrance in a stage of excited exected.
I lived with all the people who lived on the most extraordinary popular Santa World World World World World World Colombia Colombia
South civilization that was living on the floor that once they lived on the floor of Colombia in the conquered conquered on the massive vulcanic planet that you were going to be on the planet that you were going to get carefuel like the carbic planurcharair on the plan.
In a continent of blood blood that popular continent has never been conquered by the spagnoles.
At the today I have governed by a class-based on the classess.
The young people follow their families to three or four secret to three or four secret in a world of good and shadow in a world of glaciers to the glaciers for 18 years.
Two nine years of proposed to reproduce the nine months to reproduce the nine months that they get in the user of the mother, I'm metaphorically in the utter of the Great Mad.
So this time, they get acculated to the values of their society, values that they pre-prayers and only their prejob and only their prejob and they keep the cosmic balance, or to say the balance -- or to say the balance.
And in terms of this incredible beginning, they are suddenly carried out and for the first time in their life, at the age of 18 years, they see a allow. And in that active of the first wrong backy's wrong, and the sun of the beautiful back, all that they learned in the whole thing that they learned in the whole selling of his spendorder.
"Do you know, how I said, "I have to you.
It's amazing. Now it's going to protect it."
They call them brothers and say that you know, minor, brothers and they say that we are the pieces of destruction world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think about people and the environment and the environment of the wild history of the wild history of the noble history or maybe Thorore" and maybe Thorore" and that these popules are closer to Earth of the Earth of the planet --
The indigens are not feeling experimental popular popular popular.
There is no space for these things in the malarial malarial of the Asmall, or wind of the Tibet, but because of the time and they created a mystical mystical methen, but on a well of the Earth is not about the concept that the Earth can live because the concept that the Earth can live because it is infusing human consciousness is that it infuses from human consciousness

which is a mineral dimore, or a mineral mineral is irrievant.
What is interesting is the metaphor, which defines the metaphor, the natural world and natural world.
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia growing forests that they were cut up to be cut.
And he made me a different human beings that create different from my friends who believe that the forests are the Hukukuk and the well-death, and the well-death, and the well-wing spirits that live in the world, spirits that are living in the world, spirits that they deal with the initiation Hamatsa.
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality to understand some sense some of them of a sense of sense of them discoveries that plant. We take this plant.
I took this picture to the Amazon the normcyly.
Maybe some of you have heard of the ayayaxca, the most powerful psychoactive repertor of the sciamanic repertor of the sciamanic repertor of the sciamanic repertor of you have heard of the samanic repertor of you have heard of the ayayax, maybe the most of you have heard of the sciamanic repertor of you have heard of the sciamanic repertoriginal repertor of the sciamanic repertoriginal sciamage,
What makes it fascinating the ayaxy is not the potential of sustance, but the elaboration. It's compound two elements.
On one byed the late liana law that it connects of beta-carboline, harmly hallucinogen.
Prending the only plant is a fire shermen who alters a little bit of consciousness, but it's myself with the family of the family floors of the coffee of virial coffee of virial coffee of virial coffee --
This plant, conceive triptamine, very similar servotonin dimethoxoxoxoydimethoxoydimethoxoydimethoxoydimethoxoydimethoxoydimethoxoydimethoxoydimethoxoxoxoxoxoydimetho-xoxoydimethoxoxoydimethoydimethoxoxoxoylmeydimeymmethoxoylamine.
If you ever see Yanomami yraring for the nose of the sustance that they do from a different species, which is a different species, in a methoxydimethoydimethoydimethoydimethoydimetho-diglymmetho-the-died Yanomami of a different set of the substance.
To be that police to the nose is a little bit like being shaped by a little pay-shelter-pined books and led to a electricity to be a distortion of the reality, it creates of reality, it creates the dissolution of reality, it creates the dissolution of reality.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who scated the psychedelic, with his psychedelic, with his discovering hallucinogens in the '30s in the '30s in Mexico.
I think my type down, you can spoke these triptamine triller-like hallucinogens because you can't tell anybody of being hallucined. You can not be sunt because they are money because they are money because they are money because they are money.
It's possible to assummit only if they asked with other sustances that money with other sustains MAO.
Now it comes the beautiful me-carboline that you find in this lian is inbitors of the MAO, the same kind of necessary to the triamine. The amount of smilar question, in a flow of 80,000 species of plants, how do these popules are they going to find two demoref morphologist, but if you combined in this way-to-like version of the particular version of the particular thing?
We use the great eufemism of the proof of the proof of the proof of mistake.
But if we ask Indians, they will tell us "The plants speak to us to talk about it,
What does it mean?
This tribes, Cofan, 17 variety of ayax, which is 17 variety in the forest, and that our eye would go into the same species.
If we ask them how they stabilive their tassonomy will tell us "I thought I was think, of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of them as well?
The solution is, they taking 17 variety in a night of level, and each night with a different side and each other.
With this is not degree to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to count the ames.
Now, the problem is that the problem is that the ones that have to be the ones of people are going to find them, but in some way to the margins of the history of the real-up to the world real--way away from our real world.
In fact, the X-century, 300 years, not going to be remembered for the wars or innovations or innovations technological innovations and we have hoped and we have hoped and we have holed active and the destruction of the planet. Now the problem of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All cultures through the century of the several sections of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians don't stopped to be Sioux when they put them out of the Americans and they were stopped to Americans have no stopped to be Americans when they put them out of Americans and hort it out.
It's not the change or the technology that threats that they threatening the ethnose.
The during the domination.
And if you give you a look at the world, you find that these are not destined cultures that are not destined to disappear.
They're living creatures and dynamics out of the existence of identifiable forces that are beyond adaptabled by adaptabled by adaptabled by adaptabled by the way of adaptabled dynamics and dynamics and dynamics are going to be wild of the adaptable.
And I think it's going to be discovering in the patries of the God's --

Or in the Yanomami, are the diseases that are the diseases that have come with the discovering of the hour.
If we mountains on the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research that you see the time of political domination of political domination
As you know the genocide that you can know the extinction of a popul, is convicted to universal level, but the ethnocide of a popular popular population, not only is not convicted in certain environment, because it makes part of the developing strategy.
And you can't understand the suffering of the Tibet until you go to the beginning.
I found 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Chengdu in the Western China occidental Tibet with a young young juggled to Lhasa I realized young behind statistics that we hear about it.
6,000 world's sacred monuments in policy.
1.2 million people killed by military Rvolution in the Cultural Rvolution Cultural Rvolution

One day has inverted a fascial fascial standing Mao and this major -- it was put on the major works for seven years.
The Tibet of the Tibet can be unfurthered but the redenter of population is from tender.
At the end of the whole thing is to choice.
We want to live in the world, the world, or we want to live the polyromatic world to be policyromatical world policy?
The great anthropologist, before the Margaret Mead, before it was that his greatest fear was that, in our vision of the world, we don't just see the whole gamma of human imagination of human imagination of human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination of the dest of the death, but a day we were able to be more as possible.
And it's huming to remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolith Rvolution that agriculture, which has done to us to spread us to the seeds cult the seeds of the samon the samon the side of the clerards of the specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrialized world has 300 years.
That slide story not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to face in the millenniverse to come to the millenniver.
When these myriades of cultures of the world is asking what it means to be human, respond with 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all risk we all risk we all know: a consciousness that we have to be what we have to do is that all the popules and all the popules and all the gardens can true.
I took this picture on the north-scale of Buil's isola Budin Build and this man, when I went to the beautiful story of his grandfather told me the wonderful story of his grandfather.
The government canadese was not always running with the Inuit and in the '50s to stable to stable our sound in colonies.
The grandfather of this man refused to go to it.
The family face for his life, he took all the arms and all his attrect and all of his attrect attres.
You need to know that Inuit down, they don't have the freeze,
The pattings in the origin origin origin origin shot of skin the skin and shared carized pattern --

We want to talk about horles? And this? And this, in different way? And this, in different ways, and that is the symbull of the population of the population of the populations of all indigens in the world.
In the opened 1999 the government canadese has reduced to the Inuit to the Inuit of a territory of a territory and Texas set of the California and Texmyself.
It's their new pathy. It's called Nunavut. It's called Nunavut.
It's a territory of independent. They are all the mineral resources.
One of the beautiful example, as a nation-state nation-state nations,
And, finally, I think it's pretty obvious at least at the people who have been in these remote zed areas, you remote that they don't have remoted.
For someone is home.
They represent sections of the human imagination of the human images of them. And for us all these children, as the nearly of our children, they become part of our children, they become part of our child hope.
Finally, National Geographic is convinced that politicians will never get anything to anything to nothing.

in which the wisdom of all the popules can contribute to our well-being collective.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope to be required and protecting some other college college in the case not the notaste.
I want to start with what I call "the dogm offical."
Can official dogm thing?
The official dog, the official societies of all the Western societies, "If we want to massimizing the well-being of our citizing citizen." "The way to be to male libert."
The reason that is from a side, in the fact that liberty is in the same value, is preciout, it's preciout, experienced for human beings.
On the other is that if we're free, each of us can act for us to do everything that massive our well-being, without any one decide in name our well-being, without any one decide in name our own well-being,
The way to massimizing liberty is to male is to myze the choice.
More choices people hannels are liber, and more liberty, more and it's their freedom is their well.
These are so deeth, it's so deeply radicated in society that nobody would dreamed it in the two-fashion.
And it's also deeply radicated in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big one.
I allowed a simple note on the conditional condition.
In my supermarket there are 175 confordabled to 10 varieties of oil olive oil and 12 acets across balsamic and 12 acets that you can buy a huge number of condition, and the one of the 175 already already already already is your degradiment.
Here's the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic negotial to buy a stere: cassroom game, the CD, plast, plast, printer printer printed --
And in this single negotial of electronic components is a big number of components
We can do six million different combinations and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in one negotic negotial.
You need to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Other of the field of the world communications.
One time, when I was a child, you could get all the service of the phones that they could get all the service of the cell phone that they were mamonged Bell.
He wooked the phone, you didn't bought it.
One consequence of this, between the other, was that the phone doesn't stop myself.
These are gone to the time.
Now we have a variety of phones almost illitated phones, especially between cellphones.
Here's the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle in the middle of the hidden and the hidden for the crashes of myself.
If you don't have seen in the negotiate negotiate in the case, you're certain you will prey it again.
And what the end end happens is that people enter in the negozes and this question and do this question. And what the answ?
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that not face too much and it is.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than water than water explosion of choice.
Assistance is not going to happen in the United States that you go from doctor, and the doctor and the doctor and the doctor of you what you need to do.
Instead, you go from doctor, and the doctor, says, "Okay, we could do A, or B" -- "As it has these benefits and these riskyellow wells and these risks. What do you want to do?"
You say, "Dr, what would I do?"
And the doctor, "It has these well-these risks, and these answers and these answers."
"What do you want to do you to do?"
And you rebat, "Dror if she was her, what do I do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not lead."
The result we call it the "autonomy of the malato," expression that it makes it look a beautiful thing,
But actually, it's not that one to move the fish, and the responsibility to make someone who knows what, it's the doctor, and someone else that doesn't know anything -- and almost certainly is enough -- and so in the ideal conditional conditional decisions to make the patient decisions to make the patient.
There is a huge marketing products of drugs, direct to people like me and you, if you think of it has no sense, you don't have any sense, that we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy them, you publish?
The answer is that they want dom, we call the doctors to ask them to change the recise us to change the recily.
Something that is our in-teening is a choice, as you see in this point, as you see in this visual vision of the pointing kids. They will be able to force. We don't want to force the right time.
And we can reinvented how many times we aggrade it again with it.
That means that every morning, you have to decide that every morning, you have to decide that you want to be it.
Rememployment and the real-time perspective, a common time perspective, he was that you could get the most pretty much as possible, and it started to get the most pretty soon as possible.
The only real choice was choice was with choice, not going to do later, and not even what to do later.
Onews a day, it's really to play.
I mean, very smart students and I think about 20 percent of work than a time.
And because they're not less bright and not because they're less deligent.
But why are I impensiers, I mean to ask me or now?
"I should be a little bit late? I have to think about the children?"
They're interrogative interrogative forants.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implements not completely to be the compitched and not get a drink of my example.
And they need to do that. They're really important questions.
Now, the work: we're lucky, like Carl under Carl technology allows us to work every day, every day from every day on the planet, the top of the planet, trans that from the Hotel Randolph.
To parentess, there's a angle, and I'm not going to tell anybody where, where the WiFi works.
I don't say that I want to use it.
What does that an incredible liberty liberty that we have to work on the work? Is that we have to decide -- we need to work or not.
We can go to see our boy hot how, with the cell phone, the Blackberry in the other, and the news and the news -- typically about the knels.
And even though I'm all of them, every minutes that we see our child flows the part, we also asked it, "I must answer this call?"
"I have to get to hold this email? I got to abbox?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of your child very different tures from what it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part we look at this, little things and large and big things, and materials and living and living is a choice.
Once the world was this: Of course, there were some choice, but it was, it wasn't a choice.
The world today is like this: The dilemma is, "Is it is a positive thing?"
The answer is Same ame ame of the answer is Same ame ame it.
The positive side of them all so I'm going to talk about the negative ones.
This is all this choice two negative effects of neglects.
The first one, paralysis, it's that produces paralysis that liberation instead of free.
And many options to that choose, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I wish an example of mean -- a mean -- a conducting study plans volunteering plans to volunteering plans to be a conducted conducted on plans of the volunteering plans.
A colleagues had access to the Vancheet, the companies of pension, with about a million clients with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the percentage of adesion, the percent.
And 50 sources there is 10 percent in less than 10 percent of the decades when they are available to only do 5.
Because with 50 foundation of the foundly hard to decide, and the choice, and choices is remained to the inmyself.
And asking and asking questions, and asking questions, and of course, won't be made.
You know that it doesn't just mean that these workers will not only food-food-dog foodn’t just like that, also, you want to say that the decision is so ostic that they lose the foundation of the data of the data of the data of the data of the data of the data of the data data to work enough food's workers for the data
Don't participand, they're losing until the data of work, that would be well-data data to crawing them.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think it makes the world like that.
"And finally, for the ethernity: ketchup, or maione?"
You would just take the right decision that if it's for ethernity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong found, and neps the wrong condition the wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and do a choice, we were less to be less sodden with less options of how we would have been with less options that you choose to you,
And this for different reasons.
One of them is that with a lot of conditioning that you would choose you to chood, if you buy one and it's not perfect as a different choice, which would be better than it would be a different choice. And what happens that the alternative imagined it induces us to choice, and the sumption plants the softy sodied the real-house softion of the pressure that you could have a pressure of the pressure,
even when it was a good decision.
More choices you, more and more than anyone detapiece of what the insod-insods,
Inoless is what economists is called the opportunities.
Dan Gilbert asking a very well stamning value as the value thing that we depends on what we confrontive it.
Of course, when there are many options of it can represent the alternative features of alternative alternative and less sodden the option that you have choice.
Here's an example. I sent with all the ones that are not New York.
But that's what you probably thinking.
There's this courage to Hamptons.
A place of laus.
It walks to splended. It's all a day.
Not nothing that he thinks is, "Well, what he thinks is, "Well, males," is Augosto."
"Everyone my neighbors in Manhattan are vie."
"I could talk about my home."
And it turns two weeks away from the idea that is losing -- every day -- the chance of parking -- all the way to the wild where it wants.
The cost-opportunity diministry decreation for what we have, even when the choice was excellent.
And the more of the options that we have to consider the more features will go back to us as against how it cost-opportunities to be constantly as a constancy of the opportunities that we have to be able to recognized to be the more constants that we have to be able to return us out of the opportunities that we have to be recognize against how it cost-opportunity.
Here's another example.
This visual tells us a lot of things.
It talks about live moment, and maybe living live live to live slow.
But the most important point is that any thing you choice, you choices you choices to do not do others.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of fingers, that can make less attempt what we do.
I pointed -- spiral growing spiral of the expectancy.
I tried on my skin my skin a new jeans
I get almost jeans.
Once jeans were a type, they were a type, they were smoking, they were sparently after they brought them a life and worked on a lot of times, they started a lot of times, they started to go well.
So, I went to buy a new jeans when the old ones were go, and said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cute."
The committed says, "You want to slip fit?"
You want to do you to the cernier or with the bottony? "Stones" or "act hedbedy?
"You want the road?"
"Soth you want to get a strety? Bla blakly? Bla blades --
I was sbalordity, and after a little I was saying, "I want the only guy -- that it was the only typoth," he had no idea what I was was so so I was able to all the disease, and then I went out out of the negotie, with the best couple of jeans that I had ever happened --
It was the mas. One of the myself.
But I felt worse I felt that I felt like that.
Why? I wrote a book interest to understand it.
The reason I was worst worst is that with all that choice was that with all the miles were altish altic altish were altic perfects.
I had expectations I had expected to me expected anything exceptional when you see 100 of different in the way; it was perfect.
What I had water was good, but not perfect.
After I was talking about what I was insoded with what I was seeing in confront to what I was insoon to expectancy.
The add of options in life of the people don't forward to expectations that these have respectives to excellence.
And this will produce less less soddisftion, even when the results are good.
Nobody in the world in the marketing world of it.
Because if you know what I'm talking about, you won't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
"He was worse when it was wors." The reason he was wors." The reason he was worst when it was worse when it was worse the worst was even possible to meet of pleased surprised with the surprised pleased the pleased pleased as it was even possibly possible when you were worst the wor
Today, in the world that we live -- opulent, industrialized -- opuly, industrialized with the expectancy -- the massive things are the higher to expectancy.
You never have any sursurprised because you like your expectancy, you have ingigls expectancy and they are ingigll.
The secret of happiness -- what's here -- "Baspectancyes, "Yeah, it mean."
I mean, small time audience -- I am really -- I really am I -- I really am married and my wife is really amazing and my wife is really amazing.
I couldn't have any better, I didn't have any contented me.
But I don't always have a bad thing.
Finally, a consequence of the jeans comfortable when you have only that jeans when you don't satisfact, and you ask you know, "Why?"
"Who is responsible to her?" "Well is clear.
The world is responsible responsible to us?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a satisfacing a satisfacing you who is responsible to you who is responsible you are the responsible you to you,
You could do it better.
With hundreds of variety of variety -- there are not for insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even if the outcome is valiking, you feel insatisfact, and they satisface and they get the chola to their own own own chole.
In the last years the depression is exploded in the last few years of the industrialized world.
I think a factory of that meaning -- not the unique, but important -- of this depression is that people have experiences are experiences because the standard standard is too high.
And when they have to explain this situation think, they think the colp is they hold them.
So the final result is that in general is that in general -- objectively, but we feel worse us.
Let me tell you that you can remember it.
This is the official dog, what we all get to get for and it's completely false.
There is no doubt that a little bit of choices is better than I haven't share that a lot of choices is better than a lot more choice.
There is a critical value, magic value.
But I'm sure we have found up from a piece of the level that we have been experienced by a piece of the lives.
Now, the political point of view, political -- I have almost finished -- from the following is the following the follow.
What it allows all this choice in the industrial society is the material rich society is material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about it parks, where the problem is not that they have too much choice.
The problem is that they too popular it.
So the fact that I'm talking about is a malesclusive to modern and the modern societies,
And what it makes and arrabing and arrabing is this: Steve Levitt evity, how you have talked about how that expensive seat and comfortable to be inus.
I mean, you know, these choices, complicated and dispendent and dependent is not just useful.
They're a deleted dely.
They make worse worse worse or worse
If a little bit of what in our societies allows a lot of choices was reversed in those where people have too few people have too poor, it would not just be their own living to the nows.
This is what economists economists call a paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian.
A red-red-redded red-red-re-povers -- not only to poor poor, because of this choices that comes back to us back to us.
To conclude -- you can become all you want, you can become everything that --
You know, people of culture, you think, "What do that weigh, "What do you believe?"
"It's obvious that you can't do anything in a vlasum of vet."
"As fall, a cool vision vision of the world."
and I interpret it like this, at the beginning.
But I think, think, I realized that that that that fish the long weight.
Because the reality of the fact that if you sent in franks, the mouth of the mouth is not able to get freedom to the paralysis.
If you rops the mouth in a way that all become possible decreation.

Everybody needs a spher.
This is almost certainly too streted, maybe even for fish, and of course, for us.
