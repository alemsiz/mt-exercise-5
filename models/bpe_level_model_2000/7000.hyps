The year I showed these degrees to demonths to show that the calculated glacial cryartical of 48 hours of 48 percents of 48 percent, is reflying the 40 percent.
And that is the way that the gravity of the problem of the problem of the ight.
The calculate calculate calculate the climbed of the climate system, the climate system.
You go and recycle and they rected.
The next degree of the next degree of the degree of the last 25 years.

That is the wind in the wind in the wind in the wind.
You can see that the codyner of the ighborhim, five years or five years or or slooks like the sset of the body.

And you have to build a lot of other centrate of a carbon the carbon.
But we're going to change a changing changing or a change.
These are the projects of the last years, and some product of the next years, and some product of alternative res.

Maybe you have seen the news.
This is the second more folded of scores in America.
It's happened to Natal.
The public public of the audience of the carbon was this thing.
Video: I know about the rosty carbon is a kind of a kind of happine.
It's just a lot of here in America, and it's growing our economy.
Frosty carbon is always more populite.
It's a good price, and the working and working and working it in the workers and I just depend.

Video: All ll right, COALergggain the climate changes like a lot of climate in our business.
So this first is our first priority is investing a great amount of money to a very audience and confusing the truth, and confuss on the carbon the carbon.
In fact, the carbon is not spore.
We think it's a good -- has also a good degree -- he also a good provise.
So I don't precupated the climate change.
Let me do to do now.

Now, there's a new new driven by usual solution to usn'd like to use non-degrees.
Repower America, 100-percent of energy energy in didge, in diet.
A piece of a work, to do it in the work, really, you can helping the further to the crype the global crype to global furch.
Finally, a solution that you have to resolving our problems.
Repower America. Scopy of piece of piles.
Al Gor: This is the ultim.
Video: You know, I mean, it's about the America.
One of the most of the most dependence to the dependence from the dependence of the planet.
I says, "The future is here. You know, just just a new rect energy is a new rectype of the energy.
He says is the object investments for places for places of work working about requicks.
I mean, Repower of time to be realists.
Al Gor: A lot of the physky African African you go to the money to go to the solved of money to the money to solved by the solved Africa.
If you want to go to the ty."
We have to go to to the type spects.
Thank you very much.
The year to TED physical in the LHC.
And I promise to recovered to the machine.
So I realized the other time that the other time you don't have the other time you have the largest experiment of the most experiment -- 27 ckets of conference.
His recovered is rerections that were in a billion of a billion second of second the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times of the second.
All of what is simply environment.
This is the Ginevat.
We have these photographs Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Big Big Big Big Bang Big Big Big Big Big Bang Big Big Big Big Big g Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big
This is what I call it ATA, is ATA, is a 444 meters and has a diamet.
This is a picture of ATATA, in building so you can see the product of ATA, you can find the productions.
Two settled the scorrows have access to the first time to the first time.
And this pictured was to ATLATAS.
You know, you because of immense of immense in the health.
It's a picture of the first picture of particles that had made all the HC, and the HC, and deliberated, and deliberated, with a part of the HC, and hundressslevel.
In other words, when we see that this imagine, we see the 10 settled that the machines work, which is a great life.
I don't know if it was to do it is to try to do this, when someone one on Google and vide the page of the beginning was this this was this thing.
It means we have a myself a cultural impact of the scientific scientific to what scientific scientific science that we had a cultural impact that we had a mythese.
Actures a week down, it was a problem with the machine, I had to have to these films here -- these movies here -- these movies.
These are 13,000 vidence when the machines the machines the machines of the powerful powerful machine.
Now, you have to look at the grows and degrees and dirance "I don't really really really really really the mounles."
And instead of them because when I was very quickly become codings of the surprising surprising surprising in the surprising surprising in the surface of the surprising of the surface of the surround of the surround of the surprising of the surround of the surround of the surround.
So, at less 271 degrees, a temperature of the space of the space between the space of the space of the space of the stellow space in the stelling that corry.
In one of the most emid of the most emizing of the LHC, there was a difect of fabled fable.
So the movies you recycle of the rectable to recty resively involved a resistance of electrics.
This was the resulted.
Now, this is more impressions if you think that these magnets are going to fish in the skills of about 30 centimeters.
They are dang about 50 magnet.
We had to get to meas, what we have done.
We have realized and travels.
So they're going to recing all of their crazy the ground.
Entrum the end of the marzo the LHC will be new integry.
I have to get to be able to get to expect of the data of the data or children, and then we keep that our wish to find that are the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain a certain a certain a disease of science and the debt of the science and the egineering of the edge.
I think that the fact that it is so difficult to go to the bype of things like LHC.
I want to tell you with the words of a scientists of the words of human scientists of the scientists of the inuses of the inuses of his inuses of his own or or the defloor of the human minds of human behaviors of human mind, and the degree of human human minds that are not a humans of human minds that are not a set of the ideas, and that are not a new mind of the ideas, which is a new minds of the sease,
Thank you.
I want to start ask you to rethink about you to rethink about the children, I play took a children.
While you get to realized how to make them and move them and mountains, learning and mountaking them and resolving problems and resolving problems and resolving the relations.
The reason is is propertive space is connected to the way we understanding part of the world in the world of the world in us.
So, by inforced by the inforced by the top of our interaction with the physical objects to my consult of my collaborator Jeevan Kalanith, I started to ask a computers of the source, which is a computer in the sources as a calculate of the sources as a windgital of the sken of a putting information with a little information of the information of a site challenges of the sources of the sunched in a mouldn't extoppes of the sources that we can can be iness,
and system, our place across our place across our plorry?
The question was so interesting that I decided to do the answer to build the answer to build Siftable.
In fact, a Sifty is a very big computer active as a big big as a bird like a bird in the fact that I was a bird in the point.
In fact, a Sifty is a very big computer active as a big big as a bird like a bird in the fact that I was a bird in the point.
You can move with the hand, you can see the hands of them."
But I have to be objects as the mattones, you can move simply to just just just just just to simply such it just well.
The Siftable example of a new ecool of a new information to hand-information information information information to the information of the information system.
And they become more physical flock of the other ways, and they have become more physical mothers, and they become more than the motion of the motions, as a motions, as we can be exploring and different exploring new stily and different stily of interaction.
I mean, I mean, you know,
This is configured to show the video to show the video you in a direction, the video you get to a little bit of the other part of the other part of the other other class.
These are interactive interactive of the others.
If you do do it, you know, they interested ed in the time.
If they came up to condata, and they can get a little bit of a point.
If they came up to condata, and they can get a little bit of a point.
They also also their movie motion and clinked and cline.
We have a connect that one of the interesting of the interaction was the power of the interaction of the interaction of the data, "such a cycle as a liquires as a liquires of the way of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction was a liquires of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the
In this case, we have three Siftable to configured as a sects, and I can use them to be able to use them to the class of the crask of the class.
I can use them to use them to the color, where you are asked them to the midddrive to the midddris.
If we can actually put it a little bit of a little bit of it.
They also also beautiful to approach, as you can get to the English and oopes where people can square to try to make things can try to make things to be except to result the results.
Now I'm --
This is a sequency of Fibonact that I do with a degree of equations.
And we have a play of words that is in Scarabeo and Boggle.
Pratically, in the front of the received in every case in the Siftable, Procrates, and in the militerally recyle, and he certain a house of compards a detect of a decracy on a dects.
Then, after about 30 second of recks, and you have a new set of the midddrills and new possible to try to proxyth.
Thank you.
Here's the children came in the Middle Lab, I did in the Lab, I did a video.
They have a lot of a lot of it.
And one of the interesting of apply to apply is that not to tell you to the many people in many people in many people in the many of the things that are not going to give you a lot of apply to apply of the interesting of apply to just to give you a lot of apply to just to apply to to give you a lot of the things that are interesting to apply.
I just said, "I just said, "I mean, and they have to do it in the words, and they have to do it.
Here's the other people who are going to do it.
This is our best head of the most young well.
In fact, it was just imples.
They only only mattones, for him.
Now, this is an apply of a carton a interactive interactive interactive interactivity.
We wanted to build a tools for the English Lui is Felix.
It can inserve to the Exiputs in the scene, sollevents to their associates.
It can inserve to the Exiputs in the scene, sollevents to their associates.
And it is doing it using the solve.
Vide: The solved surprising.
David Merrill: One has taking a clue.
Vide: The charge.
Bel work! Sy! Som!
So I mean, Siftable to the Siftless, can make the connect people,
Video: Bau!
I inventing their story.
Vide: Ciao!
DM: It's a story with the final enough to decide as you slavery.
DM: It's a story with the final enough to decide as you slavery.
Video: Vide: I live it down.
DM: The last example of the time I have the time to show you is a tool, to recently, to recently, and exebing music.
it's a destruck of recently, to recently and exeply of music.
The Siftable here is a basic sun-based batteria.
Every different of these different different different variations, and you can get to be used to use what it used to use that us.
You can incouins these inserve until in a sequence,
And modifished to make a very simply "such a "such sequency."
These are actually actually control from the live, as the reverty and the film.
I told a particular of a particular and then you get to travel.
And then there are the effects as time and times like time and they apply to intersequence.
Let's look at how it work.
Video: D: You can institutting a base in two Siftty" -- we are going to be able to a seriously, we have to be able to add a seriously.
Now I put a bunch of basse.
Video: D: On the only of the top of the crazy --
Video: D: And I'll put the film the trum to the trum of the effect of the effect of the effect of the viewed in the fact that I can control the effect of the true.
Video: D: Do fast, I fast the whole sequence, in a time to a squence, from the other.
Video: D: And then then I will take the movie of the movie to draw more expression.
Video: D: Do I rerecombining the sequence.
So I don't have to stop the first time, but I can try to make it more than the long or more than the long or more or more than the long or more than the crype of the longer or more than the early or or more than the first time.
And I finally, I can squence, I can squence, in the squence, the Sifttable to the Sifttable to "volu."
Thank you.
So, as you can see my passion is build new interface in the whole whole whole new machines as much more than our brain and the body.
And I had time I had time to show you one of the result of this perperson in this perperson that we can actually take out of the lable.
The concept that I want to transmit you is that the new generation of objects to interact with the media degree with the dedgital in our world that we want to get to be in our world in our world in our world in our world in our world in our world way that we want to get to read with the way to be that I
Thank you very much.
I don't see the one of you have to talk about all you.
I'm a screen scrinks.
Scritical books is my profession, but it's more of this is more of this vily.
It's also the friends the fashing of my life.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But I said, "I mean, something particular is going to be in my life and my career and my career in my own own recently was to recently recently work.
The particular thing I recently have recently this book, this biography called "Mangia, Pula, Pule, and Ama" the who's in the world and become a few preceducation in the world and became a big sense of interaction, and he become a very sensition of interaction.
And the result is that everyone is that everyone to the people have been condent as if I were condence.
Davail, condent -- condent condent --
They all have to do all worry about my worry and saying, "You don't have to be able to do it more than do you can do it more than they do that?
You don't have to keep write to keep all the life without of the way you can be able to make a book that can be able to make a book?"
that can be to do you this?"
It's rasically.
But it could go to the word, I remember the most 20 years ago, when I started to say to say about people -- I was a write -- I wanted to be a write of a write of the write of the time I wanted to be a write of the time I had bego.
I memet in the same reaction of the same rected the putts.
And people says, "I don't have to have to have to have to have success?
You don't have a patient that the billion of the refied of the refty?
You don't have to be able to do this mestiate in the life without of the life that without of the mythese, and myself on a cumulo of the blood of the camazing energy of the energy of the energy of the energy?"
I know about things.
The answer -- the answer -- the answer is all these questions is, "Si."
I have to be able of all of all of the things.
I always had always been putting the time.
And I also have a lot of other things that people could not indeal to be ind.
As the other things in and other things in the other things in it.
But for what I was write I thought I thought and I thought I thought and I asked me because it is, because it is, you know,
Is it it?
It's a logical who are debed to be spect to be spring from a work that you have to be in the way to do it.
But what is so particular in the impreved to make a resect to the save to the squites that are not a way that they don't fit it doesn't make no fan of the refas?
How do I mean example, he was a engineer and I don't remember a huntil of a suntivity in the time that was asked to be asked to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to wavail?
I never -- that it was that -- that block John,
He didn't worked about it, you have to do it?
Onestly, the engineers like group like group as wing group as wing the reputation of being alcouraging to be alcoped to be alcoped in the sexual secks.
We have a written enough this reputation, and not just writers but we don't have this reputation of all generation of the general reputation of being instable to be instabable.
And it's not rest that look at the triste of the death of the death of the death of the death of the degree of the walks, and they often to square in the square.
And that you don't have a data seemed to be really, to be really, they wwomen.
Norman Mailer, before the last view in the last view of my books, my books, I had a little bit of a little bit of a little round of the work of the work of the work of their life.
But we don't have the way when we don't have to say because we heard these things that are very much much much much much much as we have interiors and accept the nurpose and the soft the soft and the sound of the way to the point of the scientist, and conduct to the sciententist, and they always heard to be a sciententists in some way of the scientist.
And the question I want to do all the way that I want to do with this ide?
You see this thing -- because it also looks like a centimeter of a centimeter of a himeter of this supposition.
I think it's a digland.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the next sexual seases.
I think it's better incording our big minds our big creative creative creative creative vivery.
And I mean, in my case, in my case, in my house -- it would be very dangerous to that I was going to feel that I was going to feel the circummmmity, and in my career in which are in my careera.
Evven -- involved -- I was quite a young young of years
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very likely that that that I write it will be in the world as I will be in the world as a work that cus, after the work that I was going to be in the last book.
It just just slavery, because we all know about friends here -- it's probable, that my great success is to mit and my balls.
Oh, Ges: OK, you think of you!
You know this is the kind of thinking about a person who take a person, to start to get to broy-mattle in the neighborh.
I would continue to keep this work that we love to do this work that we love to do this work that we love to do this work that we love to do this work that we lot.
So, the question becomes to com?
And so I mean to reflectic reflective to work to continue to continue to continue to make a couple of the protypsychological structures of reflective reflective reflectitive to continue to continue to get to to work to work to continue to get to work to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to to to continue to to get a copsychological structugical buildinging?
I had a few way of safe of such that I'm write in me, and my natural reation of course, and my natural reation is going to get to get to the E, as I was trying to do it in the way to look at the time to look at at the time to look at the time to look at the time for a few society of the way of the way of the way of the most people can have a more than than I have a much more than the way of the most power of the way to be ideas and a more than the way to do the the most of the way of the way to be able to rereact of the way of
as a creative people creative to make the inerents of the creativity.
And that researching me to the amount of Grecient and Roma.
Seguitems because I gave it and then you go back and back to the hundred of it.
In the ants of Grecicise and Roma -- people don't believe that the creative creative creativity came to the mandding?
And it was thinking that the creative was this spirit was about diving and that was seen to a few surprising of a few surprising and connected to reach the susus.
The grow of the demonths were about the demonth."
Socrates, I wonderful demon a demone of that that else of the sagain the ssagain the ssage.
The Romen were the same idea, but they called the same kind of explain a genie.
The big is that big -- because Romans don't think that a genies was someone else was a very intelligent intelligent intelligent in the fact that is a very intelligent.
They have a kind of a genide of a kind of exity in the early devine in the murchs of a little bit like a little bit like a little bit like the elfo Do Dob, and that was out of the argument of the artist of the around, and the artist of the artist of the work.
Exial -- that is the except of which is the destruction of which is the psychologic that products of the results of your work.
And all of all they were so so that was so that it was so that it was so that it was so that they were so so that they were so that they were so that they were so so that they were so that they were so that they were so so that they were so that they work.
So the artists were protype of certain the example of the too nargument for example, no?
If your work was a work that I could not take the market and all the market that are all the market that are going to help this gene of incorpore.
If your work with the work was not all the cyce, it was not all the right right right right right do?
All of all the way that was your genior to be a inability.
And so people have to concept the creative creative in Occident for a very time.
And then the Rindetaking and all the change, and we have the great idea; we have the great idea; we have the trum of the universe and the most of the ground of the ground of the details that they write from the divinity.
And it was the main the human eximent of human eximent and people start thinking about thinking about the ished creative to be completely by the ished by the istry of human eximent in the issue.
And for the first time in story, you get to referrinking this or that artist as a genie of a genium.
And I have to dively, I think was a big crazy.
I think of a very simple of a simple of creating to be like a recise of a food of the source of all the misters, creatic and surprising of the mistern and the surprising of the sket and a very much of movie or a very very much of the equal mother and the sibility of the human begin to be a great mother.
It's like a few of ingoid of ingoid the solve.
Deform and distorce and creates all these expect and creates on performance.
And I think it's been this pression to have distyed the armed in the past.
And, if this is true, and I think that I think it became to become and or?
Can we can do it different?
Magain a more than a more ants of the relationships of humans and misters.
Or maybe it down.
Maybe we don't can cell phone of thinking about 18 minutes.
And probably there are people in the audience that would be a realized me on the non-wind rection of the non-walking on the needs of folded on the earth.
I probably not just you all about all of this thing.
But the question I want to tell you is -- because you know?
Why don't think about this moun?
Because the most sense of every other thing that has never heard to explain the except of the process of the creative process of the creative process of the creative process.
A process that as anyone that you have ever tents to do something -- so much four, you don't understanding it it -- you don't understanding it uption.
And, it can seemed to seeming to seeming to be completely paranorm.
I did this instited with the extraordinary extraordinary in the same Ruth Ston the same time for all the life and he was a poet, and he was a little bit of the infected and I was a little bit of the patients in the walking in the field of the country, and I heard the recently was a country.
I said, if he was like a physical trenom in the artical food.
And that was going to get to the price of the price.
I feel heard it was to realize the land he wanted to get the land his pipes.
It was a solving thing to do to that point and he was did, he was did, says, "Do you get to a matta."
And he was to home and he was inspired to this poesia, and it would not have to make a bad of carry a piece of carry and a mathemates a mathem, as the price of the putting the putting the putting putting the price of the price and I would not have to be a putting to the price of the price of the price of the price of the paper.
Somome I could not have to be enough to be enough to be able to get to the record and the record and the poess, and the poess, and the poespecially to get through the rotough to get to roty and it would have to get to roty to ext the patient."
And then there were the times -- this piece of -- there were never -- there were no time -- there were in which the stopened that the stopped that the standy?
So, he was in home and he was trying to get to the putting the past and the poess, and he was going to go through the other squite, and then he was going to be in the other hundred and the other hand.
He was the pointed the poesise from the couple and realed in his body and realited on the pine.
And in these guys would be the way to pay the page of the page of the last word of the early word to the first time to the first time,
So when I think the thinking, is patize, is exactly iny to be a creative process.
I all my whole process -- I'm not a conduttly -- I'm not a condition to it.
I'm a muly, and my way of work is to work is, I see it is going to save me the same orary and square and square to work and square going to get to get to get to swell.
But I love in my head in my head of the type of the thing, I found that thing,
And I also imagine many of you the han han han han han han han image of you who imagine.
You know, if the work and I had the ideas I want to get to a certain a certain a certain a certainly wouldn't have to extremely slowed me to be able to wouldn't have to be done of the ideas
What is this thing?
And as we can relationship us to do not to the head that you don't have to the head of the head of the health?
For as I realized me to example or example of the musician to Tom Waits, which I interviewed in the time of years ago for a day.
We were talking about this -- and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the maybe the incarnation of the artist of the artist of control of control control of control of control species of this kind of creatizen species of a creatized cryzen of the life was interacts.
But then you invent that I was a day, and a day, and a day, and he was driving on the hydrog Angeles,
He was just quite quite a little bit of a little framed this little framef of melodia, that arried in his head as the piration, and the ske, and you know, it's wonderful and you know, it's wonderful as a him, but not as a hot of the sky of it.
It doesn't have a piece of carts, it doesn't have a recorator.
So I began to hear this kind of winkey is growing in the time, "I'm going to remarried by this chang for this chanzone of this canzone of this chang for this chang sexed by this kind of well.
I don't have enough I don't have to do it and I can't do it do."
And instead of the panic stopping in the panimal of the ball.
I will be the interest process and he did something completely new that was a new process.
I just just just just the sky and said, "Scus, I don't see that I'm not going to see that I'm not going to be young you of the way?"
"You seems to be a door a dog do?
If you really want to come back to a moment of the more opportunity when I can take me to care of touch.
Although you have to important someone else another other other other other other obs.
You have to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process working on this working in this time.
I don't have the work, the word of the sex.
But the fishing process, and the fishing was releed when the genie, the genies, the genies, the genies, the genies, the genies, and he was going to be able to read the way from where they had to be a whole thing to be a whole thing that had to be a whole thing that I had to be a whole thing that had to be a whole thing in the time.
but he swwell, I won't be wonderful to be a conversation of the Exm and this strange and this strana and that he didn't have to person was not Tom.
So how I was just just to change a little bit of a little bit of a little way I was working and I was working and I was working a type I was going to be a type of the story.
This idea, I was write when I was write "Mangia, Ama, and he said, "Mangia, and he said, "Mangia, and we have all the way we all have been working on something and I would begin to think that is going to think that that is going to be a digland and I would be a good girl, and I would never be a good good.
not just good well, just the piggaxygor written down.
And I started to think about designing this project.
But then I recovered me to the Tom that working to the aria and try to get to to a lot of them.
So I have my fact in my fact in the hands of the begin a hype of the room.
And he said, "Sent, I said, "Sent, what we know if this book, we know that if this book, it doesn't be be not going to be not going to be interactly not be going to be not to be able to your book?
Because as I see that I'm going to put all of this is not more of this -- I don't have the more of that.
So if you want to get to represents and you want to do your parts.
OK. But if I don't know that I don't know it was not quite a him.
I'm going to write I write it because my work.
And I want to favor that was recorded that I was recorded to do my te." Because I was going to do in the desert of Africa in the desert of Africa in the North th Africa in the North th of the North and music, and they were going to get to be able to the way to the bund of the way to the bad of the along and the buntil of the best of the alth.
And they were always magnific because the ballers were professionists were fantastics.
But every tant, of course, it was something happened to the arsten was actually actually transcities.
I know what you know what I know about what I know that you have all the view of a point, a performance of that.
It was like the time you stopped the ballery walking through a kind of set of different species of different suntil of different money in the solit, as 1,000 sources, but all of the suntil of the solid of the solid of the solid of the solved in the sket.
And in the vidence I don't appearly as a human.
But you have access from the digland and from the debed in the divinitivinity.
And when this happened to you, you know that I knew that was going to call it it in the nothing was called his now.
They had been and they were begin and they started to cant, "Aah, Dod God, God, God, God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know it.
He reosa name -- when Morororries the Spputting the Sprice of Spyner, and the prones that changed in the set of them to the squite, "Okay, "Ohoh, "Ohhoh, you can head in the flock of the fold.
In Sput, when a gah, a has something that I did something that you have been doing -- "Aah, omaign, you get a winke, you get to comcome, a scorrowing -- a scorrowing of God.
And it's greatom because we have to have it.
But the problem is the dadown, for the ballery of the ballery of Marteds and found that there are 11 of Marteds and the wind of Martedy of Dod is no more.
It's just a death, with the car in the original origin, and maybe not going to be able to the maybe of the charge of the charge of the challenge of the challenge of the ball.
And maybe no one will be the Dod of Dod I still know how to do you do with the rest of his life.
It's hard to him.
This is one of the most dolors of the most dolors to make a creative life.
But maybe not to deal for force to be so so that I could not believe that you don't believe that the most extraordinary of your own to be coming to be coming from you have to be coming from you in you have to be so that you have to be so much of you can be so so much as you can be so much as a lot of the most extraordinary of your own to be so extraordinary to be so extraordinary
But I believe that just just you have to get to prested in prested a instructubles of your life that you have to spend someone else when you have to spend someone when you find.
And, you know, if we think we are in this way we think about this change.
And I started thinking about thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought about different months in the working in the working in the public books that public ded, the deal of my dioxyput, the degree of my dioxized in my diox, and I was saw it to think about my great degree.
And that I have to continue to keep me when I feel feel about this is, I don't have to path.
I don't have to be the work.
He representing to representing your parts, which is almost can be all of you can see it.
If your work is ball, ball.
If the divine, I mean to make a crazy crasked a few kinds of wonderful imagine, for a moment in your sforces, "Ole."
Something you do do the same your dance.
"Ole!"
I think and I think and I think you have to teaching it.
"Ole!" " to you have to have a him, and I had to love and test to do you to get to make you to keep it to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to keep it to get to a him.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I have talked about some of these projects on the genome of human genome of the genomes.
Now we're starting to get a new percorcorcording to digitalializing biology and then in the biology of biology are going to be in a new fashing in a new fashing and winking a cryzing life.
We always always trying to realize a big questions.
"What is the lift of biological biological life, I think they have to understand a lot of levels.
We have a different approach, you reduce the minimes of the terms.
We are digitalizing from almost 20 years ago.
When we sequenced the genome of the genome of the world is to spend the world of biology of biology of biology of the computer.
Now asked us to make the life, we can regenerate the life, or create life from this universe to this universe to this universe to make the life.
This is the maps of a little organism, the Mycopplasasased genome of genome genome of those can autoreplasureplicate in the lable.
And we have to reduce the genome of the genome of a a little bit more small all small small small all all small all small all all small all all small all all small all all all small all all all the little bit more small tell.
We have to degree a centink of a hundred of genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we have a asked to his map map in the maps of rect to the now.
I redeed, this is just just just to be simple
But when we look at all genes that we can see it in the times, is very impossible to be very impossible to a cell phones that can take a vidence of the vidence of the vidence that can take a vidence of the vidence that we can take a cell of the genes that can take a cell of the genes that can take a cell in the vidence to the vidence.
So we decided that the only via to progrety was sintetizing this cromothers in a way to make a very much of these questions of these questions of these questions.
And so we have the wavaily of the "Possetycle of the Possety?
And he would be to hear the chemical consumms of a molecules that we never have to create before we never have to create before we never have to create before we never have to make it before we never have to read the chemical to produce of produce to to produce that we never have to make the chemical conversation of the big molecules.
And, in case, we can make a cromother?
A cromothers is just a piece of material material in the inerts.
The speed with which we are able to digitalized to degitalialized to exponential exponential to detect the exponential to degree to degitalialized with which we are able to degityalized to degree with the way we are going to be able to degitalized to the life is a a
Our capacity of write the geneties, instead of write and flocks, but it's better hundred of them.
And our most recents results of the result of the care of the care of the climbs.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has requid a lot of put, start with a vision of the first first beginning that first first experiments.
But we find that sexizing DNA is very difficult to DNA is very difficult to the DNA is very difficult to discover.
There are decine of thousands of the world that will product small segments of DNA, of the long ethrows of 30 to a degenerate process and it's a degeneration of the suntil of the charge is a long down.
So we had to develop a new metoh to assembling these frams and recorrect to the rest of the errors.
And this was our first tentative in the first tent, particular information of the genome of Phi Cs 174.
It's a little virus that the food that dies are food.
We designed the frames, effect the recorrection of the rection of DNA lot of DNA of DNA of DNA lot of about 5,000 literes.
The interesting part is when we have pretty this piece of material material in the batterns and we have inserve in the batters have begin this code and produce to make this kind of crazy and produce of the particle of the particle of the particles of the crug particle of the cycle of the crule of the material is in the battern.
The particles are all of the virals are release the cells, are back and they have distructures and have distructures and they distruck up and have distructures.
I talked about recent with members of the oil industry was saying, they say that they are certainly comprepretty this model.
They have more than you have more of you down.
We believe that this is a situation in which the software to build the same way to a biological system.
But we wanted to do things in biggest.
We wanted to build the whole cromother.
I'm more than 58miles the leck of genetic.
So we thought of built this in cassets of the virus, so that we can change the cassets of a cassets to understand that the vidence of a cells of a cells of a cells.
The design, and then we have to start with information with information information in a computer, these are very accurate to be very accurate to be accurate to be accurate to information in a computer, and if we start with information in a computer, and if we start with information in a computer, and if we start with information.
When we sequence, we have this genome in 1995 to the first time in 1995 to the accurates of the basis.
We find it resequence, 30 resequence. If we had to use that sequence, we had never been going to be able to do it in the way to do it work.
One part of the process is designing to design set to the long leck that you set with all the other segments of the other segments of the other segments of the bunity to build the little bit more small that works.
We can be a lot of ement in the square here.
You probably have a bad that we have to the physical physical physe.
I think about the thing: we have a genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic code and T.
And you can put them together with a codific amminoidific of the amount of the lock of the lockyet.
So we can use the code code to write words, frather than I think of them.
What we did we did was autography.
Some are states from the fact that it didn't have been a poesia.
We designed these segments for a very simply to make a very unique with thish for a middle of the degrees.
There are except that they are and put them and they are simple and they are simple them and they are all the way to be ask.
And we started to assembling the particular sect of the five to five to five to four of the way to set of the way to set of 24 hours to get to get to to 72 hours to get to 72 to 72 the lands.
And every past past these set segments in fact, so that we have to degree to sequence, we have to create a procept to create a minute.
We are trying to automatizing the process.
So, this seems to the table.
When we are going to do this very long long long long long long -- more than 100 miles the basis, not growing the most directly in E.
You get to the limbs of the biology of biology of biology of biology.
So we have to realized other month.
We know about another months of another message called rerecombination called a biology, which is to be reparate DNA gram to reparate DNA gram of unique to the segment.
Here's a example.
This organism, called Deinococks, can be redirences of three million radiation.
You can see in the requader as his cromodels as his cromost.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled as was a primal of the first time.
They have thousands of organisms of organisms of organism.
These organisms you can find completely completely square to type of it.
They can live to the way you want to get to the time.
I'm just just certain that life existing in space and you get to find new environments of water.
In fact, the NASA has showed that this was showed that this was going to show that this vien.
This is a very imagined that we built that we built these process, just used to use the design of the way of the segments of the segments of the segments of the inition of the way of a lot of a very very quickly in the way that we built using the way that we built with the way that we built with the way that we built the way to build of the chargments.
The lievievievieviews.
This is not been a scale with a microscope of the electronic disappear.
It's a very ecople that we can see the great that we can see the way with a microscop.
These are pictures that they have a period of about six seconds.
This is the audience we did a time time I did a time time.
I'm more than 58,000 leck of code genetic code of genetic.
It's the most of a largest of a structure of a structure of a making man.
He has a very evidence to 300 billion hundressss:
If we stamong a carry to a carry in a fixs, there would 142 pages just to transcities just to transcities.
Now, how do we do do that?
Of course, of course, a virus is a game of course,
It's a little more complicated when you use the battery of the batters.
It's just just when you have a cell as a cell as our recell as our rect: you can just just extremely the nuclear of the cycle of class.
In the battery of the cromother, it's integrated in the cromost, but we recently delivered that we have to make a training cromostly deling a cromoste of a cromoon a cromotion of a cromotion and another person and another crug in a crug of a cromother.
We can refit a cromox, a kind of a kind of a kind of microbial mother.
The two different are different as a men of the topis.
We have a few gene genes in the most way we decide that you can decide that you can decided to this cromos.
And then then scientists with the indegrees in the way to the protects.
And when we put in the cells was stuff, and we have a stuff, and you have the very much, the new cromother, the new cromox, and it was going to go to the cromother.
And we had thinking that we don't have to go to the type of a five to springers, we have more in the midddle of the long.
This is one of the most except of evolution.
We discovered that we found a second of a second or a second or a second of a second hungaxygene in a second of the tract of the tract of the tracks.
So, whatever you think about evolution, as a gene of the biology has not understanding of biology.
They have the deal called the restrition of restrition is that that that they addigerist DNA.
The cromosquare that was in the cell not the way it was not the way
The cell cell cromothers we have inserito---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You have a recyced the other cromother, as a cromother, has the mastice, has the mastice, and we are ritual cromos.
it became blue blue of genes we have inserve in the genes we insert.
And in a short of time, all the carcarbon a short of a kind of a kind of a species, and it's transformed in a new species, and it's transformed in the new software in the cell physical mother.
All the protein are changed the members are changed changed claws are changed to the genetic exactly what we have transferited to what we have transferits.
Now, this could seems to seeming genetic software to the software to change things in the hands of the things in the handscape of the reasons.
Now, I have already exploin that is not working about genespecies of the geness, and half a half of evolution, and I said, "I said that we're going to create a new version of the genespections that will grow new species on this processing on this process on this process on this process on this process on this process on this process.
Why do you do that?
I think it's enough when we think about our own own when we think about our our necessity.
We have to spend six billion and a half million people in the next 40 years.
Gived for a drogen example, I was in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for took a country in 1946; in 1940 years, they will be quartice in 40 years,
We were going to be problems to find the food and food, water and crashing and butts, and binal bad of people.
It will be more than it to do it for us.
We are more than five billion carbon of carbon of carbon of bars.
It means a critical cent of bars.
When we certains to find biological process of a biological process to remidddrype of a physical physical process.
In the most of all of the emission of the CO2 to CO2 to these materials that finished in the atmosphere.
Al day, today, thank you to discovered in the world, we have a datababased with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are components to think that are components to make the future.
The industry of the electronic dozen of components, and think about a lot of different components, and think about things are seven seven are seven to the except of the electronic dozen of components, and think about components, and think about components, and think about a dozen dozen of components, and think about about it is going to be sexum of a components, and think about about a dozen dozen doz
Our are the main the most main the most of the biological imagination.
Now we have a very much, thank you to these things of sintetization, able to make what we call genomic to create what we call genomic genomic combinatoria.
We have to build a big crobots that can produce a billion cromosts to the day.
Think of process of these 20 million genes of genes or a lot of a lot of a lot of a type to produce the crype of the vaccines, we can change the most of a little team, and create more than 20 years of science.
And it's just a set of standard.
We can be able to choice to the survival of survival to make a chemical chemical of carbon of carbon vaccetcs.
This is a few software of some software in which we're working to be working for a way of set to be able to make a computer.
Well, we don't know we know that we don't know how to be going to be like it will be like to know that we don't know that we know we don't know we know we don't know we know it will be like to know
We know that they are comcoming their genetic code of genetic genetic code of genetic exactly coming to genetic exactly comcoming to the genet.
Now we're concentrate in the carbon the carbon of the generation.
You also seen you can see you that you have been a fall.
We have a lot of second second and third generation that will use enough to be predicted to falling a falling of the most values as the types of banks.
But the only way that the biology can have a great impact of the major making a great mind of the wind and the answer to be transforming the answer to be transforming to design CO2 in the primal of the way that we are working for the way that we can think of the first we'll think of the first charge of the first 18 months.
The light solar combined with CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discovered in the world, we have different metodis.
This is a organism we have descriped in 1996.
You have to the ocean to the ocean to found, about 200 feet to the perature of ebolliance of water.
They read to the CO2 using of the CO2 using of energy.
We are trying to understand if we can inchchance CO2, which can be transported to be transported to be transported to be to drivertis; to drive this process.
So in the short of the way we could be able to degree what the question of the basic questions that is the life, we have the model. We have the model.
Exxype if you don't do it from TED, where you can do you do?
It would be a main the major energy.
Inoless we are working for the same standing of the same to create accines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the same way to use the same way to use the same way to use to use the stop of the same way to use to use the same way to use the same way to use the same way to use accins.
You know this year with the influence, we always have to get a year and a year and a dollars in less when you have to find the vaccine.
I think what you can change building to build vaccinable to change in anticips.
Here's how the future could start to seeming to seeming change, the evolution, the evolution, and involved the evolutions, and infinally indegree of the euclear phons, and infinally indegree to seems to be going to start to be going to start to seeming to seeming to seem to seeming the future
We are so much better than the person.
Our food is to make enough to make enough to try to try to make a long way to make a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a long way to try to make a lot of a way of living to make a long way to make a long way to be able to live to make a long way to make a long way to make it in a long way to make a
First of all you can see the more rapidly den the most working very much much fundamental work in Microsoft to Microsoft in the Microsoft in the squite exactly exactly in the midddle of the technology.
It's a environment that you can interact in the locle of the locle of data with a locle of data with a visual enormous visual enormous visual environment.
What we're seeing a lot of pictures of pictures with a kind of pictures and continue to continue to a quite quite quite a lot of the imagine.
And not how much much much much as much of information information that we see -- how much much much of these big care of these big imagins.
Most of the photographs are community in the digital example of the degree of the Congress of the Congressssh of the Congresssland.
It doesn't do any difference because the only thing that limited the prestations of a system, as this is the number of a patterns of your school.
This is a book of data not example, or not imagine.
This is Casa desolved Dickens. Ognets a hundred of Dickens.
So I showed you that it's just just a lot of imagine, and I don't imagine, we can make a representation of a representation of a representation of a representation of a photos.
It could be a little bit of a little bit of a book to read a bookelet.
Not to be a little bit of it.
This is a more realistic. You have a number of Guardian.
Every very big imagining is the beginning of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set on a sec
And you will actually actually the place and the beautiful experience of a read of a very read of a view of a view of a very very much of a very much teashion.
We also also made something with the angle of this number of Guardian.
We created a public audience, and it was a resolution -- much more than that you use in a normal normal in a normal audience.
If you want to see the carbon this authomobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or perhaps in the specific models.
And this really demonths of these ideas for the eliminating space on space on space on space on the screen.
We loving that this means you have to put it up and other port and other port and other port to be necessars.
Nature is one of the maps is one of the most obvious apply of technology.
And on this not want to tell you that I don't know that we have contributed to dropped in this camera in this camera in this camera in this camera of the walks.
These are all the roads in the USA clean imagined in the NASA.
So now we are going to past anything else.
This is actually actually actually the viewed on web; you can go to see it.
It's a project called Photososynth, which combine two different technology.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting in the computer computer in the University of the University of the University of the University of Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Selish of Mrosoft Rick Mexh.
And it's from the web, gestureed by Seadragon.
You can see when we do this kind of screen in which we can spent a picture of experience in the other experience of experience to be solution to solution of the last place of the last pattern.
But the collection of space of the images here has actually a mean.
The Grhot of visualization have recorded these images together in the way that you can recorresponse to the top of the tool of the imagins of the totypets of the Grashs of the Montagy -- are are expect of the slide of the slistable of the things of the slistable of the things are of the space of the things are in the space of the space of the space of space and and all the space of space of space of space in the space space space in the space in the suntaines of the amoritable examores.
I don't know if I have time to show you some environment.
There are some of space.
I want to go to to a type of the data of the name of the name of the name of Phosyner of Phosynthess, the first time we have to work for the first time to do you to realized you to do that that this technology, and it's really a very clear technology -- and it's not just just looking at the way of the Enth. And it is not to look at the weathess, we have to be in the weathere,
We had to worry about the ways.
This is a rebuilding in the catter of Notal Dame Dame Dame Dame is a Bast, Bast, Bast, and you get to well in Fline of the wind of the field of the field of these connections and saying a little bit of these connection of these connection of these connect except of the model.
So I'm all pictures of the Flickr and are all the level of space space in this mother.
And it's possible to savigate in this simple way to this simple way
You know, I would never thought I had to finding to work for Microsoft.
It's very grative recities of accourage that kind of accourage here.
I think you can see that you can see that it's a lot of different types of fotos of fotos in the L, a little bit of the rooms of the SL, a CL, a have a number of the environment.
And if you realize, I have to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to get the more strange.
Many of charge are block, I cryced by class.
And in some part of the photographs of photographs -- I knew -- I knew --
This is a places of Notsh Dame recorrectyped Dame rectys.
We can spend from the places of the views of this environment.
The point of the environment is that we can do things with the social environment. This is going to take the interest memory of how you apping the Exth, from the point of visual visual visization of the point of the point of the visual visize.
All of those picture are a lot of the most of the kind of the kind of the kind of the sket.
You have a model of the Earth of the Earth of the Enth.
You think about this as a long way of Stephen Lawler in the Earth Lawler on Earth of the Stephen crys.
It's something that grows in complexity that people are using to us, and the vantage for the needs for the us.
They are sect with metaphated with other people.
If someone is the idea of construct construct all these square the now, my pictures of the catter of the catter Dimprovish of all the data, and I can use all the data, and I can use it as a cycle of a care of extinct in the space of the crossing of the ckey and a cross the way of the crosssssh of the ssquare of the squite and a totype of the sk-t-totoo---old old old old old old old old old old old old crosssssssunch of the s' s' suscle cle idea of the cros
In course, a consequence of all the way of the virtual virtual of the interesting of the interesting of the ter, you don't just just just money and images and images of the images of the images of the memory of the memory of the memety of the memety of the memety of the memety of the connectitivity of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the tining of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the earlands.
Mille gradus.
Chris Anderson: I realized you have to realize it is that your software going to do is that a certain the next years, all the photographs of the next years, all the world in the world will be connected to connected to the world in the whole world in the whole world will be connect?
BA: Yeah. What is is doing it in the practice is discovered in the practice.
She creating the hyperleck of the imagins.

Once the world was this was a lot of choice in the world was some of choice.
The world is going to be like this is the delem, but it is, "It's a positive thing --
The answer is Shot is Sequal Seech.
The neglevels we all know about the negative negative negative negative views.
All of this choice has two effects of the negatic effects on the gent.
The first time, I was that realized to realized to invent that they are very instead of the bodid.
Con the type that the choice becomes very difficult to do it.
I want to give a example of you a study conducted with the planet of thinking about the planet of thinking.
A type has to have access to the Vancient of the Vanesthese, with about a billion of a billion clients in 2,000 clients in 2,000 vidence in 2,000 vidata in 2,000 different companies.

Because with 50 four-foot choice is disease, and the decided to decide to be to institutting to indetains to indetains.
And I think of questions, and I want to ask questions, and of course, and of course, I don't have to be mays.
And that doesn't mean that that I don't know that these working in the vech of the wind for cans because they don't have to be enough to say that the decision is so that the decision is so that the decision is so that they also loving of work.
They don't have a dead of the way to 50,000 dollars a year to the dator of work, that would be wwell in the way to write of them to do it.
So the paralking is a consequence.
And I think that makes the world here.
"And for finish: "The thetch, you can be a mays?"
You have to take the decision to do the decision is for the right right to the thright?
You don't want to wrong the found, and the swrong condition, and the swrong condition.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we have to get to be able to get a choice and make a choice of the result of the result of the result of the result of the options of options that the first time you have to be with less to the options of the second of the first point that would be able to be able to be able to result to be able to be able to be able to the result.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of the food of the wish of the women and it's not perfect and it's not perfect to make a different choice that would be better to do a different choice that would be better than the machines that happens is that the way that the way that it was a bunch of the sources of the sket, and the swooil.

"I could be just just just in front cas."
And in two weeks in two weeks of the idea that is perdriving -- the possible of parcheck of parchect to where you want to get where it want.
The opportunity to opportunity to that we lock the sodddwell, when the choice was exciting.
And more than the options we have to realized to the carbonies we have to recovered as a hope to be as a opportunities.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
We have the living of the lives of the lives of the living of the living of the lives.
But the most important thing is that that you can be all the choice of you can not do the other thing to do not do the other.
The things that we don't have a lot of foot that we don't have a lot of the active to reach that we do it.
Terzo you cry: I crawing the expects.
I tried on my pelling on my pelling a couple of jeans.

Why? I written a book to figure for understand it.
The reason that I was working is that with all of the choice was that the choice were swells of the jeans had to be perfects.
