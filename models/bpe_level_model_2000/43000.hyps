And last year I showed these slides to show that the calculation that the calculation that for almost three million years has had the 48 dimensions of the 48 States of 40 percent.
However, this underestyer the problem because it doesn't show the of, because it doesn't show the ice of the ice --
The artic glacial clean is in a sense, the clean clean climate heart.
You expands of inveries and the summer.
The next slide will be a fast-reached carlled on the last 25 years.
The gaus are signed in red it.
As you can see, you expanding until blue up.
That's the ice in the winter in the winter of the summer.
You can see that the cosidglacious glacious glacious -- it's like the blood -- it's like the blood of course from body.
In 25 years was spent like this, at the same time.
This is a problem because the interests is in the arrain the ocean in the ocean that are art where there are huge quantity of charcoal quantities that sheet that sheet methan.
Ript to the totality of the atmospheric pollution by the pollution of global warming, super-radoubl, this pollution of not return.
In some laghi deep-deep, in Alaska metan haws on the water.
The professor. Katey Walter of the University of Alaska has recated team recated lago last team in the winter of last last last last one.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: You're going to be well. The question is if we are also going to be even now.
A reason is that this exchange that this termic exchange the Greenland from north.
This is a fiur river, glacial Rivery,
The taken never reached levels like that.
This is the rivers of the Greenland-east of the Greenland.
If you want to know how the level of the sea level of the sea level of the lands on land.
These corrups are increasing rapidly.
From the other side of the planet: Antarctics, the greatest block of the planet.
The last month, the scientists have declared that the balance of the ice is in negative, and that the Antarctics that are western in the water in the subject, is particularly rapid in the subject of the under of the under bunch of the ice,
Since six feet in the water and level, like in Greenland.
Sull'Himalaya, the third largest block of ice ice in the laghs, that few years ago were ice.
The 40 percent of the world's population recovered half of the inner population from the skying.
Sulle Ande: this glacier is the source of this city.
The door, it is increased.
But when he decreases, the same according water.
In California the snow on Sierra Nevada is deccreates of 40 percent.
The drive of the backs.
The predictions, like you read. They've got read.
The growing growing world to a remarkable increasing inincendededs.
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm and without precedented it.
Four times more in the last 30 years in the last 30 years of the previous previous previous previous about 75 years in the last 30 years of the previous previous for the previous previous previous of the previous 30 years of the previous previous previous previous about the previous previous previous of
This is a whole thing of unsustainable.
If you look at the context of the history of the consequence.
In the last five years we've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the East of the oriental Pacific Pacific Pacific in the continent, where there is a pretty much poveriment of oxygen in the oceans.
The greater than global warming, together to deforestation, together that is 20 percent, is the using of fossil fuel.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is a bad bad to worse it.
The United States are one of the two countries with more emission, together with the China.
And it propose to build a lot of other carbon disease in a lot of other carbon and proposed to build a lot of other carbon to build a lot of other carbon to build a lot of other central central charge.
But we're seeing a change.
These are the annulled projects in the last few years and some proposites.
All of the way there is a political lotly in our country.
The carbon and the oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting the charcoal charcoal -- which is a oxy-sides.
This image reminded me reminded me to do something --
Natmal in Natma, in Tennesse, where I live there was a 3.8 billion gers.
Maybe you saw that the news news.
This is the second greatest flow of scories in America.
It was happened around Natal.
The natalizing ad, one of the carbon industries was this one.
Video: Hight. Frosty carbon is a type and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it grows our economy.
Frosty carbon is increasing more and more clean.
It's precise to price, lovely and workers keeping the stypendent stypending.
Al Gor: From here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The greater than the mountains is Massey Coal. This is Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankship: I'm going to clear -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelogiven -- don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gor: So the Proteation for the Proteation of Clima has launched two campaign.
This is one of it.
Video: Atype of COALery see the climate changes like a threatened threaten.
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a advertising effort and confused to make public and confused the choon the charge.
In fact, the carbon is not spor.
We think it's cleaned -- it's also a good fum.
So not preocupatents of climate change.
Let me do to do it.
Video: Atype -- you cleaned -- you heard a lot of talking a lot of things.
So let's take a gyoung structure.
Suntraordinary cars are a little noisy noise, but this is the sound of the technology.
The carbon is between the main causes of the main the main causes of global warms, but the night technology of the cleaning carbon that you see change.
You look at a look at the technology hate carbon technology.
Al Gore: Infinally, the positive alternative is connecting to the economic security and to that national security.
Video: High: The America, is in crisis, national security climate crisis.
The filter that college is that the connection of our dependence from the fossil fuels, like the dirty and the important.
Now, there's a new new time audance for using it.
America: 100-America: 1000 percent of clean energy in 10 years.
A plan to put the work, to make us safer and to help stop, and help stopping the global warming.
Finally, a solution that you have solution to solve our problems.
By America. You cover. You cover.
Al Gore: This is the fast.
Video: Comment: It's about to re-energy energy in America.
One of the fast further ended to dependence by the combusts that kills our planet.
Again: The future is here. Roo, sole, a new network.
She shot number 2: Noves investment for places of beautiful.
M: Repower America. It's time to be realist.
Al Gor: A old African old African old African old old says, "If you want to go to fast out.
If you want to go away away, you go away together."
We have to go away quickly.
Thank you very much.
Last year TED fect last year in the LHC.
And I promise to go back to how the machine.
So here I got it. And for those who are the other time was not there -- the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment, never tried -- 27 miles of sunconference.
His to recognize the conditions that were less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
And all of this is simply environment.
This is the underneath Ginevra machine.
We photographs these mini-Big Bang Big Bang Bievators.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's large-four-foot diameter and has a 22 feet diamet.
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS image in so you can see proportion in the purposes of it.
The 10 seeptember of the last year we have accesor the first time.
And this photo was taken by ATLAS.
It was causing to immenses festray in the control.
It's a picture of the first particle of particles that had done all the same, and deliberately done in collision, with a part of the LHC, and spread particles, and spread particlevator.
In other words, when we seen that image the 10 secten that machine, we realized that the machine worked -- which is a great life.
I don't know if it was to exultate us more opposed to Google and he went to Google and saw that the page was this --
That means that we had a cultural impact that scientific impact to the scientific impact.
About a week later, it was a problem with the machine, just had to these shared files.
These files bring 13,000 prints when the machine works in the maximum of power.
Now, technical technical of you look at files and say, "It's not true. I'm not true. I'm films under too underly."
And they can do it because when they're very cold when they are very cosids, they get cosid-superconvicts.
So, at less 271 degrees, in a rather temperature in the space of stars, these files can bring that corrup.
In one of the most of the most of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a fairly defection of factory of the most of the magnets in one of the most of the magnets in one of the LHC, there was a fairly deft.
So the files were heating up and 13,000 prints of a suddenly met that was suddenly met resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets are over 20 tons of tons and that have moved about 30 centimeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to take it, what we did it.
We have them repristine and addition and addition and addities.
They're now now now now they're going to the ground.
Englise the end of the marze, the LHC will be new integraph.
We're going to accenge it, and we expect of the data or slumn, and continue so our adventure that are the matters that are the matters that constituency the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain further way, these crashes the debate of science and engineering. It's easy to conflict to confuture.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think that's the value of things like LHC.
I wanted to conclude with the words of a scientist scientist in the inuseful -- which is that imagine, in defense of inuseful experiments of his pupll, his clear was Michael Faray, said, "No it is so dangerous for progress of human mind as the experiment. And there are no myself, which is precious to be in nature, and there are no longers, and there are no new money in nature, and that are not completely new world."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about this -- as a children, playing with a children, playing cool matter to the bricks.
And as you realize how to reach them and resolve them and resolve them, and learn them to think about and solve problems and solve problems that are falling and hand-ading relations.
The space reason is deeply connected to the way that we understand a lot of the world around us.
So, as an information inspired by using the uses of our interaction with physical objects, together to my collaborator Jeevan Kalaniths, I started asking myself, I started asking myself, and when we use a computer, instead of having the only gital gital digital that moves on a gital information with both ent.
and to our please?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided to explore the answer to the answer -- building Siftable.
In a words, a Siftable computer is a interactive computer as a cool birth.
In a words, a Siftable computer is a interactive computer as a cool birth.
You can move them with hand, they can see it in them, they can see their movement and have a wireless.
But about, I'm physics, as physics, as the matter to be simply to stay remaining them.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools for hands to digital information.
And as we become more physics, you know, you know of their movement, of the others, and as they get more physics, and as we get them to be more physics, and how we can explore and explore new interactions.
I'm going to start with some example.
This Siftable is configurated to show video -- if you including it in a direction, the video will go back to the other side of the other side of the back.
These interactive rities are aware of others.
If you saw them in the face what they are going to be there.
If they are surrounded surround, and they can get a little bit.
If they are surrounded surround, and they can get a little bit.
They also have their movement and inclin.
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was to use gestures that we have a couple of the interaction as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three configurated as secks of green and I can use them to use them to use them to the color in the central central central in the central central same.
and I can use them to use them to use them to the color in the central where they mix mix.
If we can get a little bit of it, we can put a little bit about it.
They're also beautiful possibility of learning, like language, mathematics and games of logical things to try and see the logical results, and seeing the resultype of loy-results.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacus sequence that I do with a program of equations.
We have a words of words that is half between Schabeo and Boggle.
By every turn and get a house in every Siftable, in the Siftable, and you get a house on every Siftable, and as a certain coming home on a house of words on a dictionary.
Then, about 30 seconds remissing, and you have a new set of letting and new possibility to try it.
Thank you.
Here's the kids came to the Media Lab, I did it and I swalked a video.
They are pleased a lot of them are please.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of education.
You just have to say, "Compons of words, and they exactly what to do.
Here's what other people trying to do it.
This is our youngest bete, there in the right.
It was actually wanted to stay them.
They were just just a matter for him.
Now, this is a application of a interactive cardboard.
We wanted to build a tool to learn languages in the Lui is Felix.
It can put new characters in the scene in the scene, and the Siftable their associated associated with their associated with them.
It can put new characters in the scene in the scene, and the Siftable their associated associated with their associated with them.
And that's doing the sun.
Video: The sole is smigene.
David Merrill: Now he's taken a treat in the scen.
Video: The arancient treat.
Bel work!
So school and putting them to interact with the characters can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing their story.
Video: Hellaao!
DM: It's a story with final aped, and it can decide how you do it.
DM: It's a story with final aped, and it can decide how you do it.
Video: Video: Vole,
DM: The last example, I have time to show you is a tool, realized recently to be a recently and exective to music.
it's a tool, realized recently to sample and a music.
The Siftable here are coming from sounds, based and batteria.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what use.
You can get these sound sound in a sequence to be able to your please.
And to modify it by making a sound and a "sequence."
These are effects that you can control from living, like reverbery and the filter.
And that is a particular south and then including it.
And then there are the general effects like time and volume, which applies to the sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to start putting a base in two Siftable sequence, we system, the system, we get to the extent on the size of the extend.
Now I put a lower of both line.
Video: DM: Now add to the cussions --
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the effect from live.
Video: I can know what you can fast the entire sequence the entire sequence that you can fly in the other side or from the other.
Video: DM: And now I'm going to add the movie to the base to give more expression.
Video: I can get the sequence of the sequence to the sequence "Some."
I didn't have to plan to plan before, but I can suddenly improvise to make it more longer or more stranger or more strong.
And now, finally, I can let the whole sequence inclining the whole sequence of the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new interfaces in the world and more more more and more more like our brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the outcome, and some of the outside of this and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept that I want to transmitting you to be that is coming this new generation of designed things to interact with the digital media that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
They're a write write of it.
To be a write of my professional extension is more than this, obviously.
It's also the love and the fascine of my life.
And I don't expect that it can change it.
But I said, "Well, particular is happened recently happened in my life and my career, which brought me to realibrate the entire rely recalibrating the whole report with this work.
The particular thing is that I recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Ama," what my precedented -- for some reason in the world and became a big sensational.
And the result is that everywhere now, people are like to as if I was convicty as if I were convicty.
By -- convicty!
They come from me now all worried and they say, "You don't fear more to do it?
You don't fear to continue to write for all life without any life without any more power to create a book that can be able to make someon?"
that can care about someon?"
It's reassured -- you know.
But it could go worse and I remember that I remember more than 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a write -- I wanted to be a write write -- I wanted to be a written scale.
I was going to meet the same reaction by the fear.
And people say, "Don't do you were not going to success?
You don't fear that the humiliation of the reject that humiliate you do?
You can't fear to do this mester in the whole life without any life without any swimming and die on a headathrows with the fallocation of sets with the fallip?"
So you know, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is, "Si."
Si.I fear of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also fear of many other things that people might not have to mean able.
As a algae and other things --
But as I think about what I thought I was thinking about what I thought about and I wonderly wonderly is why is it?
Is it ration?
It's logic, who needs to be expected by a work that you feel that you feel that you feel to do.
But what is so particularly in the imprecise creative to make us about the mental health mental health in a way that other career doesn't do it?
How my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and not remind of one time in its 40 years of activity that was asked if he had been afraid if he had been going to be able to engineer if he had to be able to engineer if he had to be able to get chemical engineer and I don't remember it?
It never was -- that I had never -- that John, like it?
It was not working like this, you know?
Enestly, chemical engineers like group don't have certainly in the secoupset of being alcohype to be alcohy-smanaces.
We have enough this reputation, and not just writers but creative not just writers but creative of all kinds of us -- we have this reputation of being enormously instable to forward.
And it's not recording to look at the contains of the magnific of magnific tristers who are young, and often young, they die and often for them.
And the ones that are not suicide seem to be really disdded by their womans.
Norman Mailer, before I die, in the last interview said, "Ogns my book had killed me a little bit more about their life.
But we don't bad to be able when we heard about because we heard these things that we had these things that are so that somehow we were completely interior to the notion that creativity and suffering it to the art, and it will always get art, it always will always conduct to the angood, it always will always leading to the angood, it will always get to the angood, it will always be a little bit of a way that creativity and the art, and it
And the question I want to ask all of here is you agree with this idea?
You know, it goes this -- because I also looked from a centimeter of the distance of me not good for anything this supposed to do this suppose --
I think it's hodious.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see it in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our big minds creative to live.
And I sure that in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- would be very dangerous to that I could suppose of supposed to be obviously supposed to be in my career.
Okay, I mean, they are pretty young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four work in me.
And it's very likely anything that I write about what I would write from the world as the work that used to be right by the world as a work that was going to be successful.
I'm going to be sunky, because we're all about the source here -- is likely that my greatest success is to my greatest success is to my shoulder.
Oh, Gesus, who think!
You know this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to begin to nine the nine of the morning.
I would continue to do this work that we love with this work that we have.
So, the question become, what?
And so I seemed to me -- after a lot of reflection to keep and to continue to write is to create a psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological constructive I think, right?
I have to find a distance of security of me, that I'm write of me, and my natural anxiety that I write the reaction of the reaction of the way I started looking for all the way to look through time, and seeing how to find whether they could have of better ideas and seeing if they could have better ideas and more healthier and more health and more healthier health and more healthier ideas.
how to help people creative people to help creative people in emotional recty inherents of creativity.
And that research, he led me to the ancient Greea and Rome.
Seguitems because I turn to go back and back.
In the ancient Grecia and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity came from man, OK?
And it was thinking that creativity is this about divine and that came to manner, and that came to men from a few hundred disease, for distant distant and unknown.
The Greeks called these divinspirits of the "demonished creativity of the demoni."
Socrate, wonderful, wonderful, he believed to have a demon that elarged wisdom.
The Romans were of the same idea, but they called the kind of spirit without a genius.
And that's great, because Romans didn't really think that a genius was somebody in a particularly intelligent to be a particularly intelligent --
They believed that a genius is this kind of divine that was living in the walls of an artist, a little bit like the elf, like Dobby, and that was out of the argument of the work of the argument of that work.
Except -- here is the distance of which I would talk about -- that psychological construction that protects you from your work.
And everyone knew that was so that was that worked, right?
So the anties were protected by certain things, like for example, how to do it for example, right?
If your work was exceptional work was you could take all the market, everybody knows that were helped by this encourage that I was helped by this encourage that you could have been helped by this encourage that you could have all the market, you know, you could not take all the market, you know, you know, you could not take all the market, you know, you could not take all the market,
If your work failure, it was not all your whole whole thing your whole job, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a unable to be a inability.
And so people handed the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then Renaisment came and all of this big idea; we put this great idea; we put the human being; we put the human beings and no longer and leaving space and without seeing space and without seeing divinity.
This was the principle of the rational humanity, and people began to think that creativity came completely from the ispring.
And for the first time in history, he began to referring this or artist as a rather than a genius with genie.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big mistake.
I think that allowing someone that you can make a simple person to believe that they can be like a recipe, and the source of all the mysteries of all the hythese, and unknowable's a movie or a great deal of the human beings.
It's like to ask someone to ask the sun of the sun.
Defform and histors the ego and creates all these ingestibles on the performance.
And I think that was this pressure to destroyed artists in the past.
And that's true, and I think that it is, and I think that is, and now?
Can we do this different?
Maybe you can go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and creative mystery.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't care about 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes.
And there is probably people in the audience that would have been suspects on the notion of scientific notion of the notion of the notion of them to do their projects.
Probably not convince you all about this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why do it?
Why don't don't think about it in this way?
Because it has more sense than anything that ever heard to explain explain exximpredictable.
A process that, as anyone who has ever tried to do something -- so, basically -- yso, all here -- yese, you don't get rationally.
And in fact, it can seemems completely paranormal seems completely paranormal.
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poeter. Ruth Stone, which has now 90 years, but that was a poet, and he said that during his childhood in the survey of the Virginia, working out in the fields, and I felt it in the fields, and I was going to feel.
He said that it was like a further away that was like a further away from air further away that it was like a further further away that was like a further tren.
And that was coming round to her rolling up to leaning her.
He heard it goes, because he was doing it under the earth under its feet.
He knew that we have one thing to do to the point and it was to do that point and it was to run as a morning.
And so it was going to home and it was following from this poetry, and it should not have to do that take a little piece of paper and a pretty fast, and a pretty fast, and it would collect it and deal with it on the page.
Sometimes couldn't be enough to be enough quickly, and corrective without managed to get in home and poetry it was going through and she's going to keep and she would keep rolled through the landscape, and she would go through the landscape, "another poet.
Then there were those times -- this piece don't forget -- there were the moments that was almost lose -- there were about losing almost lose --
So, it was running at home and was trying to paper, and he was trying to get a major a broky in the time it was going to be in the past, and then he said, it was like to further and the off.
He coad the poetry from the coda and the reputs in the body and the pink on the page.
And in these cases, the poetry would be presented about perfect and intact to the perfect and the last word to the first one of the first one to the first before.
So when you heard about -- it's crazy -- it's exactly the same as I felt at my creative process.
Not my creative process -- I'm not a convicty!
I'm a mule, and my way to work is to see it in the same orary orarian hours every day and south and and go over and spend it on the top of it.
But even io, in my head, I skilled against that thing, at times.
And I imagine a lot of you have done in the han.
You know, if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas would give me a certain a certain tiny I could not honestly know.
And what is this thing?
And how can we reremaining us in a way that we don't lose your head, but it makes us stay, what do you do it?
And for me about it, the best example of the most example I have is the Tom Waits, which I interviewed interviewed years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life was the incarnation of the contemporary of the art's argument, dominating these species of totally interiormyself.
But then he was hot and he hot hot and a day when he was driving on a highway to Los Angeles, changed everything for him.
He was going to fast and all of a exactly this little fragment, that it was to be a hundred in his head, elusive and exacting, and the wants, and the wants, you know, it's wonderful, and you know, it's wonderful, but it doesn't know how to take it.
It has no paper, it has no paper, it has no mathematically.
So we start to feel like this old old old old old old old old that I can say, "I'm going to lose and hope, and I'll stop by this song.
I'm not enough and I can't do cel."
And instead of going to stop in the panic --
It was a whole new mental process and made something new about it.
Look at the sky and said, "Scuse, don't you see that I'm driving I'm driving it?"
"You seems to write a song?
If you really want to exist, you know, when I can take care in a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
Other advanced to matter someone else today.
You go to Leonard Cohen."
And his worker changed after that.
Not the work, it was still dark as it always seed.
But the process, and the fishing anxiety was released when the genie, the genius, that the genius, which was that he had nothing that problems and remained it realizing that it was realizing that it was realizing that it had to be an interior.
but well, this is a very beautiful, wonderful bizarre conversation a conversation between Tom and this strange and external thing that was not Tom.
So I felt that story began to change a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a fold.
This is a saved when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Ama," and falls in one of those cave of those dispertion in which we all have when we are working on something and began to think that will be a disaster book never write to be a worst book.
Not only bad book, just the worst book written --
And I started to think about throwing this project.
But then I remember from Tom who was talking to the air and sudden.
So I went up my face on the handwrite and I would say, my job at a folding of the room.
And I said, "Yeah, what you know, both is, both both it wouldn't be brilliant not be brilliant not be brilliant not be very shore, right?
Because as I see as I am putting all of it.
So if you want it to be better and do your side and do your side.
Okay. But if you do it, you know, I don't mean anything.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to do that was recorded to today I have today I presented me to do my part, because -- at the end is that, in the end of the North Africa in the deserts of the North th and sacred and sacred it for the long dances and sacred and until hours and until hours to the falb.
And they were always magnific because the ballers, they were professional and they were fantastic.
But every one of them -- rary, something happened, and one of these artists became transcend.
And I know what I know about it, because I know that you all all of them to a point -- a performance of it.
It was as if you stopped and dang walking through a kind of land-walking species from lapsing and was not doing anything different from usual -- but everything is actually furniture and it was all folding it.
And suddenly suddenly as a human human one.
But you access to the degree and under the divinity of divinity.
And when this was happening, the time people had to know what it was, they knew what it was called it with his name.
They were given hands and start to sing, "Ah.Allah.Allah.Allah, God God."
This is God, you know.
He had a name historical -- when the Morder, the south of Spain, they would have this habited with them and pronounced in the secockets of "Ah, Allah, whoh, who's still going to be in the float.
In Spay, when an artist did something impossible and magic -- "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, bad, bad, has, you know, I mean, except -- a score.
And it's great because we need.
But the problem comes the day down, the dancers day, when you wake up and discovered that they're 11 of Martedday and found that they are 11 of Martedday and last last few of God don't more.
It's just a death-death, with the knews and maybe never be able to get to that alteapoint.
And maybe no one will be going to lead the name of God even as I walking, and what do with the rest of his life?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most dolorous reconciliations to do in a creative life.
But maybe not to be so anguishing if you can not believe that it doesn't believe -- that the most extraordinary aspects of your being coming from you as you are.
But believe that we simply that you give you a squist from a source of this squisite that you have to go to someone else when you finished when you find.
And you know, if we think of it all changes.
And so I started to think about it, and it's surely as I thought about for several months during the work's book that I published -- the dangerous, charge, fearly followed my big success.
And what I have to keep when I feel electricity to me, I don't fear you have no fear.
Not to be arguable. It's just your work.
It inues you to present you to you in your parts, whatever could be.
If your work is ball, it's dancer.
If the divine, you know, I assurd to assigned up to let some kind of wonderful to be a few times of wonder, for one moment through your effort, then "Ole!"
Other you have the same same as your dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself.
I think it out, I think it should be to teach it.
"Ole!" to yourself, even for you, even for human love and testing gain the human and testing talks to continue to do you continuously.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen.
As you know I've been talking about some of these projects on human genome projects on human genome of genes.
Now we're going to start a new furniture -- we started to type biology and now from that code code. We're entering a new fase of biology, we're getting in a new fase and synthesizing and life.
We always tried to bring big questions.
"What is life?" is something that many biological biological to understand how to various levels.
We tried to be a several approach, reducing it to the minimes.
We're digitalizing by almost 20 years hour.
When we sequenced the human genome was going to go from the analogical world of biology to the digital world of the digital world.
Now we ask us, we can regenerate the life, or create new life from this digital universe from this digital universe in the digital universe --
This is the map of a small organism, the Mycoplasm genitalium, which is the species from the smallest genome of those who can autoreplicate in the laboratorium.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit a little bit smaller.
We're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the around 500 that are here.
But when we look at his metabolic map at his metabolic, it's relatively easy about us.
She's a delivery,
But when we look at all the genes that we can helightly elimind, it's very imlikely that this can bring to a live.
So we decided that the only way to progress to be to synthesize this chromosome, so that we could modify the components.
And so we started the winning adventurs of "Post a cromom of a cromom that we can synthesign.
Can chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never managed to create before?
And in a grant, we can make a chromosound?
A chromosome, it's just a piece of chemical material inert.
The speed with which we are able to type the life is growing up to exponential exponential to the exponential real.
Our ability to write the genetic code, instead, progress, but it's better deeth.
And our recent most recently the door to a exponential curve.
We started over 15 years ago.
The process has requires a lot of past, began with a biothic reviewed reviewing the first experiments.
But we found that we synthesize DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produce small sign sign of DNA, of the 30 to 50 to 50 to 50 to 50 to 50 to the land-a-a-to-land is a long time there are there.
So we had to develop a new methodd to assembling these fragments and correct the errors.
And this was our first attempt to start by the gital information of Phi X 174.
It's a little virus that batteries killed batteries.
We designed the errors of the errors and made a molecule, and I got a molecule.
The interesting part of this is when we took this piece of inert material and we put it in the bacteria, the bacteria, and they began to read this genetic code.
The particles are then released by cells, they went back to the cells, they went back and destroyed the E. cools.
I was talking about recent recent industry says that they certainly understanding that they certainly understanding this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build the same hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the more in big things.
We wanted to build the whole chromosome.
They're more than 580 miles les, genetic code.
So we thought we build it in the cassets of virus, so that we could change cassets to understand what the cassets are a living cassets of a living cell.
The projection is crucial and if we start with digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 to accurate was a standard for every 10 thousand basis.
We found it, resequencing, 30 herrors. If we had used that original sequence we never had been able to do this work.
One part of the process is to design, that you can go through the lengths that are overlapping with all the other seats of 50 letters of the 50 letters of levels of the smaller working together.
We do a unique elements here.
You probably read that we read about the fall.
Think about it. We have a genetic code genetic code.
Three of those letters code together with about 20 wind baid -- and there's a specific order of letting for every adminoacishing.
So we can use genetic code to write words, though.
What we did in the beginning is automorrow it.
Some of them were deused by the fact that it was not poetry.
We have designed these segments to just just just joining them with the entires.
There are gaps that repaid them and put them and put them together.
And we started to assembling the parts, starting with segments from five to seven miles, once it holds of 24 miles of letting 24 miles on them to 72 milands literally until 72 milliters.
For we have produced these segments in abundance so that we can sequence, so that we're trying to create a extremely robuster -- as you will see, as you will see, in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this looks like the tabellon a basket.
When we get to these very long-scale segments, more than 100 miles aren't going to grow it in E. cool.
You get to the limited tools of the modern biology tools.
So we have other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called a omologist, which is in biology to repair the biology of the segments.
Here is an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiation can absorb three million radiation of radiation.
You can see in the high school require as his chromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours is just like it before.
There is thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can sected.
They can live under the empty lives.
They're absolutely certain that life exists in space, and you go to new environments of water.
Actually, NASA showed that this view that this view of this lives.
This is a molecular image of the molecule, which we built using these process, just using the box, using the box.
The lievidence them assembly them self-assembly of it.
This was not taken with a electronic microscope, but with a rular microscope that was not taken to rule.
It's a molecular molecule, which we can see it with a lawer microscope of law.
These are photos that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a long time ago.
It's more than 580,000 lects, genetic code.
It's the greatest molecules of a defined structure that we ever created by man.
It has a molecular weight to 300 million of them --
If we spend it with a 10 cararacter 10 without spaces, it would take to a code.
Now, how do we do it? How can we do it?
Of course, you can experienced a virus is a game play.
It's a little more complicated when you use bacteria.
It's also eucarios when it's about eucarios as our recell as our res: you can simply extractly the nucleus and insert a clonation process.
In the bacterium chromosome, the chromosome, but we recently recently shown that we are able to do a complete transplant traplant that we are able to do a cell further and activate it.
We can reficiated a chromosome, a microbial species
The two are different than men are quite as men as men as man.
We have add a few genes in a way that we decide to decide what choosing for this chromosoun.
And he skilled with the people in a way to kill all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cellum was wonderful -- and you appreciate our so-physticatos -- the new chromosome, the new chromosome, the new cell phone.
And we started to think that we couldn't go beyond it, but we tried to be going to push.
This is one of the most extremely evolution.
We found that many species have added a second or a third or a third or a third of a few hundreds of new tracts of thousands of new tracts of new tracts of exacts.
So who thinks about evolution as a only gene that is a lot of the biology.
There is people called the restriction in the restriction is that further digerisming DNA.
The chromosome, that was in the cellum doesn't have one of it.
The cell phone; the cromosome, we put it up-hand there.
It's expressed, and recognized the other chromosome, and we have masticked it with only just the cell and we just just with the cell and the new cromosoun.
it's became blue to cause, of the genes we hoped it.
And in a short time, all the characteristics of a species went out of the whole whole new species, and it turned from the new species, based on the new software in the cell phone.
All the proteins have changed, the member of proteins have changed, and when we read the genetic code of exactly what we have transferred you.
Now, this could seem alterny, but by altering DNA we can change the software as sustain.
Now, I have already explained that this is not about genesis -- but by three million years of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion that you can create new species on this gital process.
Why do that?
I think it's enough when we think about our own necessarily necessarily necessarily.
We're going to spend six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one of the existing existing in 1946, there are going to be four of it.
We're going to have problems now to find food, fresh, fresh, fresh, down-half billion and a half billion and a half million and a half million and a half half billion people.
It's going to be more laster for nine billion.
We can lize more than five billion carbon of 30 billion bards.
That means a day.
When we try to find biological process, or any kind of process to stay them, it's going to be a huge challenge and to be a huge challenge to be a huge challenge to be a huge challenge to be a huge chally.
And in the more of all the way of CO2 emission of these materials that end up in the atmosphere.
At the day, thanks today, thanks all around the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes of genes, and I like to think that are the design components for the future.
The electronic industry has only one dozen about components, and think about how many different things came out.
Our limits here are data principlely by biological reality and our imagination.
Now we have technical technics, thesization, thesization, in grab of creating what we call combinatories.
We're able to build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
Think about a processing these 20 million genes or to try to get the processes to get optimize the processes or drugs, new vaccines, we can change a little team, and create bigger than in the last 20 years of science.
And it's simply a standard section.
We can choose for possibility of survival, chemistry or carbon or carbon gams.
This is a few software programmed instants that we're working for seat, and designing species to be able to seat, and design.
Well, we don't really know necessarily as they will be there.
We know exactly how they are their genetic code.
Now we're concentrating on the fourth generation.
You saw you that you can extract ethanol from the grand was a finish.
We have a second further and third generation that will use enough pretty soon as a higher carbon as the higher price or functions like the eighth of fun kinds of fun as the eighth types of the butanol.
But the only way biology can have a big impact without a big impact without a big impact and limited the cost of the food, and we think we were working cell in the first materials that we are working on the plans that can reach this discocourage this discocovery, and we think we could have the carbonds that can reach them in about 18 months.
The sunlight with the CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries all around the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean deep in the ocean deep deep-foundation of equal equipment.
It creates handing CO2 using hydrogen using energy as source as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can get CO2, that can easily be transported by making care carried by the charge, to drive that CO2 in the carbant carbant, to drive this process.
So in a short we think we could be able to get what the basic question, "What is life, what the basic is Now, truth. We have the goal of oil to repiring the oil industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do that?
It would become a major source of energy.
And also, we're working for using the same way to use the same way to create vaccines.
You saw this year with influence, we're always background and a dollar, and a dollar, under when you treat the right when you treat the right --
I think that this is going to change building vaccinable in an anticipating.
That's how the future could start to seem to change it, now, the tree of evolution, accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria with synthetic bacterial cells.
We're so much to be so from better to improve people.
Our purpose is to do a way of live to do it. Thank you.
First of all I'm going to show you the most quickly possible, a fundamental work that we took to Microsoft in the followed water in a year ago.
It's a local environment that you can interact is to the local level, which remote with a huge amount of visual data --
We're seeing a lot of gabytes of photo-digital footo-fast fast and continue, to be a panoramic, to say the images as we want it.
And it doesn't matter how big information is the amount of information that we see, how big these data or images.
Most photographs are digital photographs, but this for example, it's a coming scansion, and it gets in the gam. And he reaches in the gam.
Not a difference because the only thing that is the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any moment. It's also an architecture almost flexible architecture.
This is a book -- this is an example of data not images.
This is the Dickens. Every coon-desolated Dens. Every coonn's column represents a capitly.
To show you that it's about text and not images, we can do a thing, to do a very thing, to see really that it's a real representation of the text of the text -- not a photo.
It could be a little argument to read a electronic book a electronic book --
I don't think of it.
This is a more realistic. It's a number of a Guardian for Guardian example.
Every image is the beginning of a section.
And it gives you the pleasure and the beauty of read the very chart of a magazine or a magazine of a magician or a quotidian version of a half a lot of meet.
We also did something with the angle of this number of this particular Guardian angle of this number of Guardian angle of this number of angle in the corner.
We created a high-resolution-resolution-resolution, much higher than what you use in a normal advertising -- and we put in the extra.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other other models, or even the techniques.
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen.
We hope that this means to put pop-up and other similar, and other parts of similar, not to be necessary.
Of course, maping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose that time, if not to say that we have contributes to give it in this field.
These are all the roads in the USA overreplaces on a NASA.
So now we go to something else.
This is actually from the vive on the web; you can go to see.
It's about a project called Photosynth, which is two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research, a very interesting research, a student of the Washington, with the University of Washington, with Seitz of the U.S. and Resear. Seitz of Microsoft Resear. Research. See Research. See Seaddition and a collaboration.
And it's from Seadragon the web, range.
You can see when we do this when we do this kind of screen that we can go from one image to the other kind of experience and have this kind of experience to multiple resolution.
But the space colloses here has actually actually actually actually a meaning.
The gorithms of visualization of the computers recorded these images together, so that makes the real places that imagined -- all the closer to the Grashes on Montags on Montags -- have been taked. Have element -- have been taked. So here are all the face of a slides or imaging of a slides of spatial levels or space in space -- and these things are all in space in space in space --
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environments.
There's some of the more space than it is a few more space than them.
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noahynthy -- and this is from a precedent prototynthy that we have done for the first time you do what I think is really the key to show you what I think is really the key with this technology, Photosynth. And it's not necessarily very evidence that we put in the web. And that's not necessarily very evil.
We had to worry about legal aspects and sading.
This is a rebuilding in the Notre Dame is a rebuilding in Flickr. Basta digitate in Flickr. And you get images of these types of types in the machining field, and so on.
So they are all pictures up by Flickr and have been all colleged in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never have thought about to end up to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratifying this kind of column.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of fun of different kinds of frames of those cell phones to the professional lands: like significant, a significant number of meaningful environment.
And if I can try to look for those strange.
Most are blocked, etc.
Somewhere you have a series of photographs -- and her.
This is a Notre poster of Notre poster Right.
We can go from the poster to physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do with the social environment. This is now taking from all of the way -- from the entire collective viewing point of view -- and it all those data together.
All of those photos become college, more of the size of the parts.
You have a model of the land that emerge.
Think about this as the Stephen Lawler work.
It's something that grows in complexity as as people useful as people us, and the vantages for people who us.
Their photos are marced with other people.
If someone is the idea of contrast all of these sants saying the name of Notre Dame improvided up all of those data, and I can use it as a data of all those data, and I can use as a point of all of those data, and I can use the photos of anybody else else is using the photos of anybody else and cross-model.
Of course, a consequence of this is virtual virtual virtual models of every interesting part of the earth, and so on. They don't just as a view airplane and similar images, but by the memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood about it? What your software going to be doing is that at a certain point, in the next years, all the photographs shared everybody in the whole world will be basically college in the whole world will be basically college together?
BA: Yeah. That's what it's doing is basically discover.
He's creating a hyperlin, if you want to him, between images.
And it's doing it in the bottom of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the rich information that many of these images can him.
As when you make a research, you know, you deal with a sentence, and the head on the web has a lot of information about the images of the picture.
Now, what happens if that photo all of your photo?
Then the amount of interconnection and the amount of rechemical and the recipe of rective that is really huge classic. It's a classic effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible. Compliments.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the main pleasures when you travels travels of the ethos of the ethods, who has no anti-traditional researching the past, the people who are true, the pasts of the ragiven of the rain of the ragiving plants.
Basti to think that Jaguar, Jaguar, or the Vily Way, or that the myths of the ancient Inuit still meant to be meaningful for meaningly that in Himalaya, to remind the reminds of the anthropologister of the anthropologist, and the idea that we are not a sense of the anthropoloy -- but it's just a model of reality, but it's just a model of reality,
the consequence of a particular choices that our stirps that our stirps have done in the consequence of it.
And of course, we all share of the essential trates.
We all got it. We all procreive.
We're subjected to be initiation.
We have to deal with the inexority, so we don't surprising us if we don't surprising and whales --
all of us have an art.
What it is the particular is the particular song, the rhythm of every culture.
Not matter that they are the Pars of the Borneo, or the Voodoo Haiti, or the Voodoo warriors of the Sersut in Kenya settentries, Curgan an an Sahara.
He was my journey companion the desert of yak in the desert of yak in the valley in the valley in the valley in the world.
All of these people teaching that there are other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of moving in the world.
And if you reflect a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
Insidly, my riadies of the world create a ragnateffort of spiritual life and cultural that it fly has a nice to the planet and it's important to the planet as a raise like an raising biopen bioses as biosphere.
And you can think about this rather cultural as a as a a way and you can call the ethnose. And you can define the ethnos; myth, dreams, ideas, inspirations, inspirations, inspirations, intuitions in being from the awareness of the awareness of consciousness.
The ethnos: The ethnos: The ethoddy of humanity.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we are in as species as species --
And because the biosphere was free free of securred as it was very quickly as a lot more quicker and purch.
No biologist, for example, it would say that 50, it would say that 50, it was just about the orle of the aximum -- in the apocality, and not even near the pocality, and not even near the most of the biological diversity -- that is not even near the most optimistic diversity.
The indication of all is -- of course, the language.
When you were born there were 6,000 languages on this planet.
One language is not just by a vocabolary or from a vocabolary or a series of rules.
One language, it's pushing of the human spirit of spirit language.
It's the means that the animation of every culture comes in the material.
Every languages is a forest of the mind, a thinking, a thinking, a thinking, a thinking, a spiritual ecosystem of spiritual possibility.
And of those 6,000 languages, while we're here sitting here sitting here in Monterey, at least half the horses;
They don't be teached to children, which means that you want to say not to be a little bit of it, which is already to be dead.
What is more than being folded by silence, of being fold, the last tongue about the language of the tonguage of the daughters?
This is a fellow was the state of somewhere in a few weeks -- every two weeks a walking away and leads a gun-d-sillabe language.
And I know that someone of you will say, "Is it it better than that?
The world would not be a better place if we all have the same language?" OK, then we are all slightly speaking all yoruba. We spected.
We talk to a love kogies.
You'll be covered a tract thing that you can't talk about your language.
I would like to do a journey through the ethnos:
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a sure of what we're lolosing.
Many of us forget when I say, "different ways of existing existing really different exists.
Let's take for example, this birth Barasan Amazon the Scentriony of the anaconda, which creates to the military of the west sandwide, which creates of the head of the skys.
It's a popular that it's not able to distinguished the blue color, because the time is identified in the forest, from the forest, from which it depends on the forest, from which it depends on the forest, which is identified to the popular blue of the wind of the green courage is identified in the forest, which is identified in the forest, from the green because the blue of the wind is not able to distinguished in the po
They've got a strange and a mathematical rule, "languagod, language, "English, you have a different language.
And all of this has been in the mythological past, the particularity is that in these families that are talking about six or seven languages because of the mystics of a language.
They listen to and then start talking about.
Let's take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived -- the Waorang of the Ecuador who had had the first contact in 1958.
In 1957 five missionaries have tried a contact of a fact that a fact that a fact error.
They made up from the photographs that were rety that had been writing them in a population that this population of the plugly forested that this population had never seen anything in the biggest dimension.
They raised the photos from the ground, they turned to a form or a figura -- not finding anything -- they were concluded that it was the diavol, and they killed the five with the langes.
But Waoranese don't just kill the strangers.
They knew in one of them.
Five percent of the mortality was caused by them of them were several for them to them.
We have been at eight generations and we found two natural cases and we found two natural cases and when we insisted that one of them was a lot of them was instead of that was dead and then they kill it himself. And then they kill it a knowledge. Satee every time, they had a knowledge.
The hunters were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognized the species.
In the early '80s, I was assigned a very interesting tong, when my Harvard professor when my Haitites asked me if I wanted to go to Haititi in the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes, and making myself, and impossessed me to do the zombies.
To make sense to the miracle, I should have understanding the Vodoun culture, and that is not nera.
It's a quite metaphysics of a metaphysics of the world.
It's a very interesting.
If I ask to tell me the big religions of the world, what would you say?
Cristianym, Islam, Budddhism, English.
A continent is always left out, thinking that sub-Saharan Africa, and it doesn't feels to religious and the Voodoo is not that the distilled of these religious concepts that are very deepted away in the tragics of the tragics of the slavish of the slavish slavies.
What makes you interesting is that it is the intense of life and death the death of life and death.
So you live to live the spirits.
You know, you can be invocated by the Great Grande Aqua, they replace to the dance of the dance and replacing in the soul of the way that for a short of the way that it becomes the dio.
So the voodoodoodoods, they love to say, "You white people go to talk about God.
We damage in the temple and become God."
And since you're going to sit you, is the spirit that drives you drive, how can you do that?
So you know, it looks like these incredible events -- following your instates that touch touches ink-infire demonstration of the power of the power when it was catalyyalyzed in the body when it was catalyzed in the way of exciting exciting in a state of exciting exciting state.
And I lived with the most extraordinary popules are the most extraordinary Kogi Sierra de Santa Mara, in the Santa Mara, in the Colombia.
Finentent scendent of the ancient civilization that once they lived on the floors of Colombia in the conquery, the population was going to be on the vulcanic plan.
In a blood lady of blood that this popular was never been conquered by specnostics.
They're governed by a class today, but their formation is decided, but their formation is a very extraordinary --
The young follows are taken by the family at three or four years and living in a good world of buy and shadow in a good and shadow in the base of the glaciers for 18 years.
Two nine years of choices to reduce the nine months of the gestation that turned into the user of the mother, now I'm metaphorically in the user of Great Mad.
For this time, they get acculate to the values of their societies that predict that their praying and only their praying and their praying the cosmic balance.
At the end of this incredible inition and that was suddenly carried out and for the first time in life -- at the age of 18 years, seeing an alba. And in that awareness of the first cutter, when the sun kyrows of the beautiful g, all that they have learned in the whole whole thing that they have learned in the whole whole of of his beautiful.
"Right? Proroprise how I said,
It's wondering. Now it's about you going to protect it."
They called the greater brothers and say that we have, brothers are the pilling of the destruction of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think about indigenous populations and the environment invoke Rousau and old the old story of the noble history of the noble or maybe Thorewild Thoreasily popules are closer to the Earth of us.
The indigenes are not feeling under unexperimental under our algiving.
There is no space for these things in the malaric stau or in the Asmall wind gelies in the Tibet, but because of time and they created a mystic of the Earth based on the concept of it. But in a little bit of a lot of behavior. It can just live the Earth can only live because it has been infusing human concept that the Earth is going to live because it is infusing human concept --
What does it mean?
It means a bunch of And, who grows believing that the mountain is a spirit of Apu that will be a deep human beingly being deeply and will have a very differently different and it will have a very different, with a little girl, or that place that grows a mountain and a further Montagan is a bag of rocket.
That is a dimoral dimore, or a mineral mineral is irrievating.
What is interesting is the metaphor, that defines the report between individual and natural world and natural world.
I grew up in the forests of Columbia creding that the forests serving that the forests served to be cut.
And he realized me a different from my friends who believe that the forests are the forests that believe that the forests are the Hukuk and the spirits of the paradisease and spirits that live in the Hukukuk and the spirits that live in the Hamatsa.
If you start to look at that these cultures can create reality reality that can start understanding some of them of the discoveries of sense. We take this plant.
I took this picture to the top in the northwestern Amazon the normal Amaz.
Maybe some of you have heard about ayax, the most powerful psychoactive repertoive repertor of sciamanic repertor of sciamanic repertor of the repertor of the repertor of the repertor of some of you have heard about ayayax, the most of you have heard of the ayayaxcal repertoize the repertor of the skill.
What makes it fascinating ayaxis not the farm, but the elaboration. It's compoint, but its elaboration. It's compointed by two elements.
On one side, this lian, that conties a series of better-carbine, harmine and harm, slightly hallucine, slightly hallucine, slightly hallucine, slightly hallucine, slightly hallucine, and harm, slightly hallucine, harmly hallucine, and harm, slightly hallucins a series of between.
Taking the only plant is a blue smoke a little blue that alters a little bit of the family of a coffee of a house of the family of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of viridis.
This is a triploylevel, very similar fashion, dimetho-five methoximoximoxoximame.
If you ever see Yanomami guy's going to see the nose the substance that are doing from a different species, which is that same as a set of species, na-a-methoxydimethoxytamine.
To be that pole on the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a pathy of paintings and landing on a skype of electricity. It creates a distort of reality. It creates a distort of reality. It creates a distort of reality.
I often often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who has been chedelic, with his fungion discovery fungs in the '30s in the '30s, in Mexico.
And in my testhesis you can't classrooms like hallucinoxens like halluciny, because if you're done in the same. Silled can be about. The triamines can not be absolutely very much because they are denied by an awful way that is in the extinct of course that is natural in the intestine, you know, of course monoxious.
It's possible to highly just if you assumption, with other chemices that denies the MAO.
Now the beautiful, the between -- the between. It's the MAO, the same kind of needs to potentially potentially to potentiate trial to potentiate trip. The question smiles on a floflying sources of 80,000 species of plants, like these popules are not a biochemical version of it, but if you can actually be a biochemical version of thession, but if you can get a biochemical version of the particular things?
We use the great euphemism of the proof of the proof of the proof of them, that can be revealed with it.
But if we ask to Indians, they will tell us "The plants speaking to us."
What does it mean?
This tribe, Cof, Cofan, has 17 variety of ayaxca, which is born in the forest, and that the eyes would come in the same species.
If you ask them how they are going to say that they will tell us how they will say, "I thought I understand plant, the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of it?"
The solution is: they take the 17 varieties in a night and each night and each dog with a different type with a different type.
With you don't have to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to count the sames.
Now, the problem is that also the problem is that the ones of us who have to care crowing them are of the history of the history of the history of the history of the real world and spends to it.
In fact, the XX-century, in 300 years, it will not be remember for the wars or the technological innovations -- but rather like it was where we stopped and we have abbrushed and we have abbrushed the mass distruction of biological diversity and cultural diversity and cultural diversity is not change.
All cultures through the century have been involved in a dance for new life.
And the problem is not technology.
The Sioux doesn't stopped to be Sioux when they put part of them and freckes like Americans don't have stopped to be Americans when they put part of the horse and hor.
It's not the change or the technology that threatening the integrity of ethnosphere.
The fly last, the fly of domination.
And if you give you a look at the world, you will discover that these are not destined cultures to disappear.
They're living and dynamics and dynamics outside from existence to the existence that are beyond their ability to adaptation of adaptations.

As you will know the genocide that physics of a popul, is convicted to universal level, but the ethnoce, the ethnoce, not just convicted to the same, not just convicted, but addiriting in the environment, because it is part of the developing of developing for.
And you can't understand the suffering of Tibet until you start in the beginning.
I have been running the 16,000 miles from China in the Western China through Tibet to Lhasa with a young and a young and a young -- and just comed to Lhasa I realized what we heard about it.

The great anthropologist, before he dies said that his greatest was that, in our further was that, in our vision was that, in our vision of the world, we don't just see the whole gam, we will not just see the whole gam, but a day we see on a sleeping modality of though, but a day we see a delease that there were other possibility.
And it's humiliating to remind that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolitical Rvolution that has given us the agriculture, which has made us us to the seed of the seed of the seed of the samp with the prosthety of the cline, creating the gerarchy of the specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The industrialized world has at 300 years old.
That shark history don't suggests that we have answers to all the challenges that we have to face in the millen.
When these myrias of cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human being, respond with 10,000 different voice.
And it's in these answers that we all responsible risk of being what we are. And we are going to be what we are.
I took this photograph on the very north of Baffin, when I went to the Buil's hunting with Inuit, and this man, and this man, Olaya, he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather.
The Canadian government was not always always compent, with the Inuit and in the '50s to stabilit our sounds, we have reined them in colonies.
The grandfather of this man refused to go on.
The family, them, I was seen for his life, and he took all the arms, and all of its inches.
You have to know that Inuit not the cold, the freeze, the exploitating.

One beautiful example of how a country can reconciliate with his popular with his popule.
And finally, I think it's pretty obvious at least to the people who have been in these remote zed areas, realized that they don't remove remoted.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope I hope to call other than I had heard and try to get some collegments, in the case doesn't have notaste.
I want to start with what I call "the officer dog.
The official officer of what?
The officer of all the Western societies in the Western industrial societies -- "If we want to massive our citizen."
The reason the side of a side of the moon is in the fact that freedom is preciout, essential for human beings.
On the other is that if we are free, each one of us can act to do everything that is about what massive our well-being, without any one that decide in name our own own own nobody that decide in our name of our well.
The way to massixmize freedom is to male freedom choice.
More people hannow, the people are more free, and the bigger is their freedom, and it's their well.
This, this is so deeply deeply in society that nobody would be dreamed to put it in the doub.
And it's also deeply deeply in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has made possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly great.
I allowed a simple name on the conditions.
In my supermarket are 175 conditions, without containing 10 varieties of oil and 12 acets of oil and 12 acets that you can buy for you to do a huge number of conditional conditions, in the surrounds in the surrounds of the skilling that nobody of your degradiments is of your degradid.
That's how the supermarket.
Then you go to the electronic store a stere: class, cassroom, charg, charge, printing charge.
And in this single negotic negotic negotic negotiats.
We can do six and a half million different half of combinations using components that there are in one negotid.
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Other than the field: the world of communications.
Once, when I was a child can get all the services for the phonical phones desired, and pact that they were proviited by the mom Bell.
He was reading the phone; you didn't buy it up.
One consequence of that, in the other, was that the phone doesn't rops out.
These days.
We've got a variety of phones almost illitated phones, especially between cells.
Here's the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle, letter MP3, cheleli cute, and form in the nose for the nose, and form in the nine.
If you don't have seen in the story of the store, you know, beyond you will pretty soon to pretty much reverse it will be pretty much pretty much house in the store, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's going to be a good store in the store.
And what happens is that people are in the story is that people go into the story and asking, what is the answer?
It's not possible to buy a cell phones that don't do too many things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water of the choices that are a lot of choice.
Assistency health is: It doesn't happens in the United States you walk from doctor and the doctor of what you do.
Instead, you go from the doctor, and the doctor says, "Okay, could we do A, or B," "As it has these well-shopes and these risks. What do you want to do?"
You say, "Dr, what should I do?"
And the doctor says, "As these goods, and these risks, and Brit: and these risk."
"What do you want to do?"
And you said, "Dr. If you were to be what to do it?"
And the doctor: "But I am not here."
The result we call it "autonomy of the malat," expression that makes it seems to be a beautiful.
But actually, it's not that one is that a shift and responsibility of taking decisions from someone who knows someone who knows about someone who knows that doesn't know -- and so in not -- and so in not in condition, and so in not in the ideal condition to take the patient.
There's an enormous marketing products pharmaceutics, if you think about people like me and you, that if you think of it has no sense, that we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy them, because if we can't buy them?
The answer is that they want domor we call the doctor to ask them to ask the recipe recipe to the recipe recipe of it.
Something like this is our identity as our identity is a question of choice, as you see in this svignet. We don't want to force. We don't want to force. We don't want to force. We don't want to get more an identity: we need to invent a bunch of identity: we need to inve.
And we can reinvention us how many times we can get it.
That means that every morning, you must decide that every morning, you must decide that kind of person wants to be.
Rips to the family and the marriage, a time time perspective, ungry for anyone -- it was that you could get married the pretty soon as possible, and it was going to get the pretty much pretty soon as possible.
The only choice was with choice was with choice -- not here, and even what to do later.
Ogam, it's really to play.
I teach them very smart students, and I think about 20 percent less of a time.
And not because they're lewing, not because they're less diligent.
But why I'm impensiers, I mean to ask you, I should get married or now? I should do it now?"
"I should get married more targuing? I have to think about before the kids or career?"
They're a logating.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implementy don't completely recognize that segen and don't get a good vote to my exam.
And they have to really do it. I'm important questioning about it.
Now, the work: we're lucky, like Carl under-sky, because technology allows us to work every day, from every day, from every day, from every day, from every day, from the Hotel Randolph.
To parentess, there's a corner, and I'm not going to tell anybody where, where WiFi works.
I don't say that, because I want to use it.
What does that mean, this incredible freedom of choice that we have to decide about the work? Is that we have to decide, if we have to work or not.
We can go to the cell on the typical play with the cell phone in a task, and the notebook, and the narrow -- and the knews on the knews, typically on the knews of the knews of the kney play in the task.
And even though they're all scent, every minute that we see our son boy to see the gamount of boy, we're also asking this call?"
"I have to answer this email? I have to ablease this letter?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes experience of your child very different than what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of the look at thing, things and big things, and big objects and life, life is a question of choice.
Once the world was this: Of course, there were some possibilities, but it was not a question of choice.
The world today is like this, the dilemma is, "Ilemma is -- "Is it a positive, or negative negative or negative now?"
The answer is the Shim.
The positive side of the negative side of the negative sources.
All this choice of two neg-effects on the people.
The first one, paradoxment, is that it produces instead of free instead of free instead of free --
With many options of the options that becomes very difficult to do it.
I offer an example of an example of a fairplanes on the plans of voluntarian example of voluntarian example of the voluntarian example of the voluntarian example of a fairly example.
A My colleagues to the Vancertain the Vancers, gigants of a million sources of pension, with about a million companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the more, the percentage of the 22 percent.
With 50 sources there is 10 percent in less than when they have been available. Why?
Because with 50 source in the way that choice, is maledetail, and choice, and choices is remained to question.
And asking and questions, questions, questions, and questions, and of course, questions don't feel there.
You know, you know, it doesn't just mean that these workers will be able to have food, because they don't have enough money, it means that the decision is so ostic that decision is so ostic that decision is so ostic that is so osticking the founds of work.
Not teipand, they're lost to 50, in the worker of work, which would be well displaced to versate them.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think it makes the world like that.
"And finally, for the ethernity: "How do you fe?"
You would just take the right decision, if it's for ethernity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong source, and neps the wrong condition of it.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we can avoid the paralysis, we end up to the end end end of how we would have been able to be as a result of how we would have been with less options that chooses.
And this for different reasons.
One of them is that with many of them is that with a lot of choice, if you buy and it's not perfect and it's not perfect to do a different choice, which is that it would be better at it. And what happens is that the alternative imagined it induces the alternative foot and the reduce the softwtion of the faith. And the recovery.
even when it was a great decision.
More choices us, the more is easy to dispive any details of the option.
And also, there's what economists called the cost of opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asks, very well stamacting as the value that we depend on what we confrontive to what we confrontation with it.
And in the stay of the options of the options of the alternative options of the alternative choices of the option that you have choice.
Here's an example. I example. I example.
But that's what you probably thinking.
There's this copy to Hamptons.
A place of lux-sussix.
Find day. It's all about them.
Nothing that he thinks is what he thinks is, "Well, maldition is Augsto."
"Everybody of my neighbors in Manhattan are alive.
"I could be a parking park in front of home."
And it goes two weeks away from the idea that it's lost -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants.
The expensive opportunity decrease for what we have, even when the choice is that we have, even when the choice was excellent.
And the more are the options that we have to consider, the more characteristics will be returned out to as a cost of opportunity.
Here is another example.
This is a lot of things.
It talks about living the moment, and maybe living slowly to live it.
But the most important point is that any thing you choice, you choices you choices don't do anything else to the others.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of four that can make less attention, what we do.
Third point: A spiral growing expectations.
I tried on my skin my buy a new jews of jews.
I think about almost always jeans.
Once the jeans were one of the type, they were bought and clothed by bestived and they had a life and worked a life and worked a life and worked a lot of times, began to go good.
So I went to buy a couple new when the old old were going, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cutt."
The comfortable told me to say, "You want slim fitty?"
Would you like it with the cernier or bottonight? "Shed." "What?
"Dathan?"
"Of course them wants large, or stretch, or stretching it elenough.
I was standing up and after a little I was managed to say, "I want the only guy -- that was the only typoth." It had no idea of what I was going to try to do all the males' said, "jeans, I went out of the negos, I went out of the negos, I had a better jeans that I had gone to do.
It was the male of the whole choice had had the best.
But I felt like that.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice is that with all of the expectation was high for the whole choice, the jeans had to be perfect.
I had expectations -- I didn't expect at all, when I had only existed when 100 of them had only one type, but when 100 different people had to be perfect.
What I had water was good -- but not perfect.
After I had paragoned what I was trying to get with what I was trying to confront in the expectations.
The add of options in the life of people don't like to forward expectations that these have respect to excellence.
And this will produce less soddisftion, even when the results are good --
None in the world of marketing if it makes it count.
because if you know it, you won't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
"You were better when it was worse when it was worse when you was worse when you was worse when you was worse when it was worse when it was worse was even possible to meet the surprisely surprising surprising surprising and surprising the pleasant to the floors.
Today, in the world that we live -- opulent, industrialized with the expectancy -- the citizens that we can hope is that things are at the high of expectations.
You never will be surprising because your expectancy, my expectancy, my expectancy, they are injug.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is -- is "Baspectace," "Yes, "Yes, I mean."
I mean, little time audience -- which is really married -- which is really married and my wife is really wonder.
I could not have been doing better -- I don't have a content.
But you don't always have a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of buy a couple of jeans when there is only that when there is only that when you don't mean and you ask you, "Why?"
"Who's responsible?" And the answer is clearly.
The world is responsible. What could I do about it?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a satisfacing that you have a responsible insods, and you ask who is responsible to you are -- you are you.
You could do it better than you do better.
With hundreds of varieties available, there are no excuse for insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even if the result is the outcome, you feel insatisfied and damaged and gives the same.
In the last few years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world
I think a meaning factor -- not the unique, but important -- of this depression is that people have experiences to be that people have experiences because the standard standard standard is too high.
And when they have to explain this situation think that the cope is them.
So the final result is that in general is that in general -- but we feel worse we feel that we feel worse it.
Let me reminds you that you remember it.
This is the offical dog, what we all take for good and it's completely false. It's not true.
There is no doubt that a little bit of choice, and it doesn't have a lot better not to be a lot better than a lot of choice.
There's a critical value, magic value. I don't know what it is.
But they're sure enough that we have been by a piece of the level that choices the level that we have been a lot of them are sure that we have been safe to be pretty sure that we have been sure that we have been pretty sure that choices that choices are sure that we have enough to get out of a piece of the level
Now, from the political point -- I've almost finished -- from the view point of view, the following point.
What it allows all this choice in the industrial society is the material recharge.
There are many places in the world, and you know about it in which the problem is not that they have too many places in the world,
The problem is that they have too popular.
So the fact that I'm talking about is a bad to the modern of modern, rich societies.
And what makes and arrabby is this: Steve Levitt evitt tells you about how the expensive and comfortable of the car seats are inuseful. It's a waste of money.
I mean that these choices, complicated and dispendful, it's not that they simply inuseful.
They're folks are deleted.
They make it worse in the worst of it.
If a little bit of what in our societies allows a lot of choices was reversed in those where people have too poors have too poors to be better but also now.
This is what economists call a better paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian.
A ridiculation of the reddwarps is well in -- not just to poor -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice that comes back to us.
To concluding -- you can become all that you want to be everything that wants --
And you know, people of culture, you know, what does that weigh, "What about the fish?"
"It's obvious that you can't do anything in a vetron in a veter."
"Again, a confiddence, a limited vision of the world."
and I was charged this to the early of this in the beginning.
But then, thinking about it, instead, I realized that that fish, that fish the long way that that fish.
Because the facts is that if you go to frankly, the ms the mouse, so that you can't get free," you don't get freedom. You get the paralysis.
If you rom the mouth in a way that you can become possible sods.
You accept the paralysis, and you reduce the well.
Everybody needs a sphere.
This is almost certainly too strect, maybe even for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic of a few symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic set.
Thank you very much heart.
