<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is about three million years had the size of the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, it's <unk> <unk>, it's <unk> <unk>.
So, this <unk> <unk>, because it's not <unk> the <unk> of the ice.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is, in a certain sense, the heart <unk> of the global <unk>.
It's <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red red.
So you see, you get it back to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which is <unk> <unk>.
You can see that the ice <unk>, of five years, it's like <unk>, which here is how blood blood, which is <unk>.
In 25 years is <unk>, so that.
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> in the ocean <unk>, where there are huge amount of <unk> that, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>,
I'm going to <unk> <unk> <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, that we can't <unk>.
And in some <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> team, <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: <unk> is good.
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> of <unk>.
If you want to know how you <unk> the sea level of the <unk> <unk> on <unk>, here is where the sea.

<unk> other side of the planet: <unk>, the largest <unk> of the planet.
The last month, the scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk>, and that <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
They're going to go to six feet of the <unk>, like <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the third <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which was <unk>, which was <unk>.
The 40 percent of the world's population <unk> <unk> from the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: This is the <unk> of this city.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when we <unk>, the same happens to the water.
In California, <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk>.

<unk> times <unk> in the last 30 years to the <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the <unk>.
If you look in the context of the <unk>, you can see the <unk>.
In the last five years we've been <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day.
Look at the <unk> area, <unk>, from <unk>, and on the <unk>, and on both the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen.
The most <unk> of the global <unk>, which is 20 percent, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and the <unk> is even even even even.
The United States is one of the two countries with the <unk>, together.
And they're <unk> to build a lot of <unk>.
But we're going to <unk> a <unk> of direction.
These are the <unk> <unk> in the last years and some <unk> <unk>.
And so, there's a <unk> <unk> in our country.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> something --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where live, there was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Maybe you've seen on the <unk>.
This is the second <unk> of <unk> in America.
It's success around <unk>.
<unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> here in America, and it's <unk> our economy.

The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk>. This is <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> -- <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- not know what they're talking about.
<unk> <unk>: So the <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
So, this is <unk> a lot of money in a <unk> <unk> to make the public and <unk> the truth.
In fact, the <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it's also a good <unk>.
So we don't <unk> of climate change.
We do it.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of a lot of <unk>.
So I'm going to <unk> a <unk> <unk> for how we're going to <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! The machines are a little bit <unk>, but this is the sound of the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is between <unk> <unk>, but the <unk> <unk>, but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see everything.
And I look at a look: this is the <unk> technology.

<unk>: <unk>: <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the national <unk>, the national crisis.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> all of our <unk> from <unk> <unk>, like <unk> <unk> and oil <unk>.
Now, but, there's a new <unk>, <unk> solution for <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of energy <unk>, in 10 years.
A <unk> <unk> for <unk>, <unk> more <unk>, and help to <unk> the global <unk>.

<unk> <unk>: A old old <unk> says, "If you want to go, you go from the <unk>.
If you want to go from the <unk>. "
We have to go from <unk>,
Thank you very much.
<unk> year I did a <unk> on the <unk>.
And we <unk> <unk> on how it works works.
So we're <unk>. And for those who were not, the <unk> is the largest <unk> <unk> -- <unk>, <unk> miles of <unk>.
<unk> is <unk> <unk> the <unk> that were less than a <unk> of a second <unk> of the universe -- until we go to millions of times a second.
All that's just <unk>.
This is the car under <unk>.
So we <unk> these <unk> <unk>.
This is what work. It's called <unk> -- it's <unk> <unk>.
This is an <unk> image of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk>.
The 10 <unk> of the last year we've <unk> the car for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> from <unk>.
It was because of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
It's an image of the first <unk> of <unk> that had done all the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with a part of <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In other words, when we <unk> that the <unk> 10, <unk> that the <unk> <unk>, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to <unk> us to <unk> <unk>, and I'm going to Google and <unk> that the page was this.
That means we've got a <unk> impact on the <unk>.
And we had a week later, there was a problem with the car, it was a problem with this <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true."
And instead of you can do that because when they're very <unk> <unk>.
So, in a <unk> degrees, at a <unk> <unk> to that the space between the stars, these <unk> can bring that.
And in one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in <unk>, there was a <unk> <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and that you have <unk> about 30 <unk>.
They're <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We have <unk> them and <unk>.
Now they're <unk> all of their <unk>.
And I <unk> the <unk> <unk> will be <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, and we get <unk> to get the data to <unk> or <unk>, and so our <unk> to find out what they are the <unk> that <unk> the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the <unk> of science and <unk>.
I think the fact that it's so hard, the fact of the <unk>, I think that's the value of things like <unk>.
I'd like to <unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk>, <unk>, which, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, he said, "It was <unk> to <unk>, said," It's <unk> for the <unk> of human mind as the <unk> of human mind, that <unk> are not <unk> that <unk> <unk> that are not <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>,
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when, children, <unk> with <unk>.
<unk> <unk> as <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, actually, <unk>, and <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> part of the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> <unk>, and I started <unk>, with <unk> objects, and my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk>, I started to <unk>: "And if we use a computer computer, instead of a computer, instead of the <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk>, with the <unk> <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> <unk>,
and we're going to <unk>?
The question was so interesting that we <unk> to explore the answer, you know, the <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> like a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> like a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with the hand, you can <unk> "between them, and they have a <unk> and a screen.
But <unk>, they're <unk>, like <unk>, you can just <unk>.
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> the <unk> information.
And they're going to be more <unk>, <unk> of the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, of the other, of the other, of how we can explore them, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I'm going to be a few example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about the video: if we <unk> it in a direction, the video, if we go from the other <unk>.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
If you <unk> them, you know what they're going around.
If they're <unk>, you can <unk> it, you can <unk> a little bit.
If they're <unk>, you can <unk> it, you can <unk> a little bit.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> that we use <unk> on the data, to example, to "a color like if it was a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk>, and I can <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
And I can <unk> for <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, where you get <unk>.
If you're too, we can <unk> a little place.
I'm also <unk> to <unk>, like <unk>, like <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk>, where people can try things things to make things things things, and they <unk> the results.
I'm --
This is a <unk> <unk> that I do with a program.
Here we have a game of words that is in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, at every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and as we <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
Then, about 30 seconds, you get a new <unk> and <unk> <unk> and new <unk> to try.
Thank you.
Here's the <unk> <unk> <unk>, I did it in a way that we <unk> them and <unk> a video.
They're <unk> very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things of this <unk> is that you don't have to people.
<unk> just say, "<unk> of the words," and they know exactly what we do.
Here's other people who <unk>.
This is our <unk> <unk>, there's the <unk>.
It wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is an <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's going to build a <unk> <unk>.
It can <unk> new <unk>, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new <unk>, <unk> their <unk>.
So, that's going to get the sun.
<unk>: The <unk> is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now he <unk> a <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work!
So we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the <unk>,
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk>, and you can decide how you <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk>, and you can decide how you <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>.
<unk>: The last example that I have the time of you is a <unk>, and <unk> music.
It's a <unk>, that's a <unk>, and <unk> music.
<unk> here, <unk> <unk> as the bottom, and the <unk>.
And you have four different <unk>, and you can have to you.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk>.
And I just'm going to <unk> a <unk>, "and a <unk> <unk>."
These are actually actually <unk> from the live, like <unk> and <unk>.
We <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> for <unk>.
And then there are the <unk> like time and <unk>, which is <unk> to the entire <unk>.
<unk> like it works.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, the other <unk>.
Now we're going to <unk> a line.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: Now <unk> <unk> --
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>, so I can <unk> the <unk>, so I can control the effect from the <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the other.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
So I don't have to <unk>, but I can <unk>, <unk> more <unk>.
And now, I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> <unk> on the left <unk> <unk>. "
Thank you.
So, you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk>, more <unk> <unk>, how they work works and body.
And today, I've got time to show you one of the results of this, and some <unk> that we're going to try to get out of the lab.
So the idea I want to <unk> is that this new generation of <unk> to <unk> with the average <unk>, which information information in our world way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the now of you.
It's a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more than this, of course.
It's also the love and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't think that can change.
But, said this, something particular is success in my life, and my career, who <unk> me to <unk> the whole whole <unk>.
The particular thing is that I wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "for some reason reason for some reason to be a big, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that <unk> <unk>, people <unk> me as I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to be <unk> and said, "You don't think that you're not going to do better?
You don't think it's going to write the life without more to create a book that can create a book that can <unk> someone? "
What can you get to somebody? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could go, and I remember the most of the 20 years ago, when I was going to say, a <unk> -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> the same <unk> <unk>.
And people said, "You know," Don't <unk> to be able to have?
You don't think the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> you?
You've never <unk> to do this <unk> for all the life without anything is ever out and <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>? "
So you know.
The <unk> answer -- the short answer to all these questions is: "
Well, I'm <unk> of all those things.
I've got <unk>.
And I'm also sure of a lot of other things that people can't <unk>.
So, the <unk> and other things.
But, for how do I thought, I thought, and I thought, it's why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anybody <unk> to be <unk> from a job that you're <unk> to do.
But what's so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don't?
So, my father was a <unk> <unk> and I didn't remember about a <unk> <unk>, and I don't remember you know, you know, what he was asked to be <unk>?
And it was never -- that <unk> <unk>, how do you go?
They're not <unk> so, <unk>?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> as a group, they don't know, in <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not only <unk>, but we have this <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And they're not going to look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, who, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> young, <unk> and often as much hand.
And also those who are not <unk> to be <unk> to be <unk> from their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, first of <unk> said, "Every <unk> said," Every book, my book <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But we don't <unk> when we've heard these things so much about that we've got these things so much <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some way that art and <unk> are in some way, and the art, and the art, and it's <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> you to all here today is, you're <unk> with this idea?
I'm going to tell you that -- because it's also <unk> from a <unk> <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better <unk> <unk> to live.
And I know, I know, in my case -- it would be very <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
<unk> -- I'm pretty young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that any thing is now in the world, it's going to be <unk> from the <unk> that I have the success of my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all all over the <unk>, it's <unk> that my <unk> is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>!
You know this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to <unk> <unk> <unk> at the nine morning and I don't want to do it.
I love to do that work.
So, the question is, how?
And so I think, after many <unk>, that the way to work to write the <unk> is to <unk> a <unk> <unk>, OK?
I have to have to find a <unk> <unk> in me, which I'm <unk>, and my natural <unk> on what we wrote to <unk>. And as we would be <unk> for all the year of this year, as we're going to look at the time, and find more <unk> and <unk>, if you have more <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, and I'm going to see the best <unk>.
<unk> on how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And that research <unk> me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
They're <unk> because they <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that <unk> creativity, <unk>, <unk> people don't believe that <unk> creativity, OK?
They <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> and <unk>, and they're <unk> to the men from a few <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
<unk> were the same idea, but we <unk> that species of the spirit without a <unk>.
So the <unk> is <unk>, because the <unk> doesn't really <unk> that a <unk> <unk>.
I think that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>, literally in the <unk> of a artist, a little artist, and that <unk> out of the <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> out out of the artist and <unk> out of that work.
<unk> <unk> here, that's the <unk> <unk> that I talk about that -- that <unk> you from the results of your work.
And all <unk> that was so that we <unk>, right?
So the artists were <unk> from <unk> things, like for example, like for example, no?
If your work was <unk> not <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, all of <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
If your work <unk>, it was not all <unk>.
All you know that, <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk>.
Then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk>, and we <unk> this big idea; we put the human <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> without more space to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without more space to <unk> <unk>.
This was the <unk> of <unk> and people <unk> to think about that <unk> creativity.
And for the first time in the history, you get to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think that was a big <unk>.
I think I would be <unk> to believe that, a simple person to believe that, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk>, and it's a <unk> <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk>.
It's like you ask somebody of the sun.
<unk> and <unk> <unk> and it's <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And, if that's true, and I think it's, and I think it's the question, and now?
Can we we do it?
They go back to a more <unk> of the relationship between humans and <unk>.
Or maybe it's not.
Maybe we can't we <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> <unk>.
And there's probably people in the public <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, <unk>, you know, people <unk> on their projects.
You probably don't know all about this thing.
But the question I'd like to <unk> is -- why don't you?
Why don't we go in this way?
Because it's more than any other thing that you've ever heard for the <unk> <unk>.
A process that's <unk>, like anybody who ever <unk> to do something -- so, so, all here -- you know, you know, you know, you know, a process.
And, in fact, it can be completely <unk>.
I did this <unk> <unk> <unk>, who has now <unk>, who has a <unk> for the <unk>, which was a <unk> for all the life and said that in his <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> out of the <unk> <unk>, and I said that in the <unk> <unk>, and then <unk> <unk> <unk>, and when a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I said that it was like a <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> it, because he <unk> the land under his feet.
I was going to have one thing to do that. And he was <unk>, "<unk> as a <unk>."
And so we went back and he was <unk> from this <unk>, and it didn't have to get another piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk>, and a <unk> enough enough, and <unk> on the page.
And sometimes we're not going to be <unk>, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> the <unk> through the <unk> and she would be <unk> to <unk> through the <unk>, and it would be <unk> to <unk> through the <unk>, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, and she said, you know, and she said
And then there were those times -- this piece never <unk> -- there were the <unk> <unk> -- OK?
So, he was <unk> at home and he was trying to the <unk> through, and he was a <unk> <unk> in the while that was <unk>, and he said, that it was how you <unk> with the other hand and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> <unk> would be <unk> on the page, but the last word to the last word.
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it's exactly the <unk> to my <unk> process.
They don't all my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; I'm <unk> to the same <unk> and work and work on the <unk>.
But even I was, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that what, sometimes.
And I think that we have a lot of you have done.
You know, even if the work and the ideas I could <unk> me from a certain <unk>, I can't <unk> <unk>.
And what's this thing?
And how can we <unk> it to it not <unk> us to do it. But, rather, that's pretty, that's a <unk> <unk>?
So, to me, the best example I've got the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, which I've been <unk>.
I'm talking about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life was the <unk> <unk>, trying to control, <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then <unk>, you <unk>, and a day as he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> all for him.
And we're going to go and all of a <unk> <unk>, that's a <unk> <unk>, which is wonderful, and <unk>, and <unk>, you want, and the <unk>, but not how to <unk>.
It's no piece of paper, he didn't have a <unk>, it's not a <unk>.
So I'm going to feel this kind of <unk> <unk> in him, "I'm going to <unk>, and <unk> <unk> from this <unk> song.
I'm not <unk> enough and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of going to go in <unk>, you know.
So, we <unk> the entire process and made something completely new.
I just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>, you know, you don't see you you see that?"
"You know, you can write a song?
If you really want to <unk>, you know, you can <unk> care of you.
<unk>, <unk> <unk>.
They're going to <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his process <unk> <unk> after this.
They didn't work, the work, the work was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that was <unk> when we <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that <unk>, the <unk> that we <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> back from the <unk>, where it was not to be a <unk>.
But I'm going to <unk> this <unk> <unk> a conversation and this <unk> <unk>, and this <unk> thing, and that was not <unk>.
So how I <unk> that story to change a little bit about a little bit that I'm going to be a little bit of it.
This idea, I was <unk> when I was <unk>, "<unk>," and <unk>, "and we're going to think about something and we're working on something and we're going to think that's going to think that is going to be a <unk>, which is going to be a <unk>,
They don't just <unk>, just the book <unk>.
And I'm going to think of this project.
But then I <unk> <unk> that <unk> in the air and <unk>.
So I <unk> my <unk> <unk> and <unk> my <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk>.
And I said, "<unk>," What, what, both we know if this book is not going to be <unk>.
Because you see it all I'm <unk> all that I have, I don't have more than this.
So if you want you to do it, you have to <unk> and do your part.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what, you know, you know, nothing.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I'd like to you that was <unk> that I'm <unk> to do my part of "because -- it's so, OK -- it's so, OK -- it's so, you know, you know, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> hours to hours and <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every <unk>, something <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually actually <unk>.
And I know you know what I'm going to talk, because I know you all, you know, you know, a <unk>.
It was like if the time you <unk>, and the <unk> through a <unk> <unk> and was no <unk> <unk>, like <unk>, as the <unk> <unk>, but all <unk>.
And it's not just <unk> as a human human.
But they <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
And when this <unk>, the <unk> people what was, <unk>, the <unk> with his name.
<unk> your hands and <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God, "God," God, "
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> this <unk> <unk>, <unk> this <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "which you can see in <unk> or <unk>.
In <unk>, when a artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- one of God.
And it's <unk> because we need.
But, the problem comes up the day after, for the <unk>, when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's just a <unk> with the <unk>, and maybe you never <unk> to that <unk>.
And perhaps nobody <unk> the name of God still, and so what's going to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the <unk> <unk> to make in a <unk> life.
But maybe it's not to be so <unk> if you can't believe, you know, that the most <unk> of your being being being <unk>.
But I just just just <unk> you from a <unk> <unk> of this <unk> <unk> of this <unk> <unk>.
And, you know, if we think that it's all.
And so I started <unk>, and it's <unk> as I've been <unk> for different months in the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>,
And that I have to go to <unk> when I feel like this is, not <unk>.
It's not <unk>.
They're going to <unk> for your part, any of it.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, you're going to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some <unk> <unk> <unk> some <unk> <unk>, for a moment through your <unk>, then you know, then "<unk>!"
<unk>, you do the same <unk>.
And "<unk>!"
I think, and I think it's <unk>.
"<unk>!" You know, you know, even for the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
So, you know, I've been talking about some of the human genome, on what we can <unk> and <unk> <unk> of new genes.
Now we're going to <unk> a new <unk>, and now now now on the <unk>. We're going to <unk> it in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We've been trying to <unk> <unk>.
"<unk> is the life?" It's something that many <unk> I think they have <unk> to understand them.
We tried to <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk>.
We're <unk> from 20 years.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> <unk> <unk> to go from the <unk> world of the digital world.
Now we can <unk> the life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the species from the <unk> to the <unk>.
And we tried to <unk> the genome to <unk> a <unk>, and we have more small.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that are here.
But when we give a look at its map, it's simple <unk> to our <unk>.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one, it's very <unk> that can bring a <unk>.
So I thought that the only <unk> <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk>, this <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
So we started the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>? "
Can you the <unk> <unk> of them, that we never have been able to create the first time of the now?
And, in case, we can make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk>.
The speed with which we're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
Our ability to write the code, instead, instead, instead of <unk>, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We've got more than 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before.
But we found that that we've found that DNA <unk>.
There are <unk> of thousands of machines in the world that we're <unk> <unk> <unk>, and it's a <unk> process: the most <unk> is a <unk> process: the most <unk> is <unk>, there are.
So we had to develop a new <unk> for <unk> these <unk> and <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, at the information of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
It's a little <unk> <unk> that bacteria.
We've got the <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk>.
The interesting is when we've got this piece of <unk> <unk> and we have <unk> in bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> from cells, they're <unk> from the <unk>, and they <unk> <unk>.
I talked about about <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have <unk> this model.
They have more than you.
So what this is a situation that the software can actually build the software to build the same <unk> system.
But we do the most things in the big.
We're going to build the <unk> of the <unk>.
They're more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought of <unk> in the size of the <unk>, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a cell cell cell.
The <unk> is <unk>, and if we <unk> information in a computer, these have to be very <unk>.
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in the <unk> was <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
We found, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If you're going to be able to do that the <unk> <unk>.
One of the process is to <unk> 50 <unk> that you have <unk> to build more <unk> <unk> to build more <unk> that we're <unk> together.
It's going to be <unk> here.
You've got to read that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: We have a <unk> code <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
And we have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and there's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk>.
So we can use the <unk> code for <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did we did at the beginning was <unk>.
Some of the <unk> that was that was not <unk>.
We've <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In every step, we've got a <unk> <unk> that we're <unk> that we're <unk> to create a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
When we're going to <unk> that much, more than 100 <unk>, not <unk> <unk>, not <unk> <unk>.
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> of biology.
So we've got <unk> other <unk>.
And we're going to <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk>, which is going to <unk> the DNA.
Here's a example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk>, like his <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
In 12 -- 24 hours is exactly how it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can <unk>.
We have to live in <unk>.
They're absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and you get <unk> to find new <unk> <unk>.
At the <unk>, <unk> has showed that this is.
This is an image of the <unk> that we built through these <unk>, just using the <unk> with the design <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> them.
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are picture that I've got a time of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we did a time ago.
They're more than <unk> <unk>.
It's the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ever <unk> from the man.
It's a <unk> weight of 300 million.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> <unk>, we're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now, how we do we do it?
Of course, with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a little bit more <unk> when they use the bacteria.
It's more simple when you're <unk> cells as <unk> as our <unk>, you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is <unk>.
In <unk> <unk>, the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell, but we've <unk> <unk> that we can do a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from a <unk> cell to another.
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> are the <unk> of the <unk>.
We have <unk> some <unk> in the way that we can decide what you want to do for this <unk>.
And it's <unk> with the <unk> in a way that we <unk> all <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk>, <unk> <unk>,
And we're going to <unk> that we don't go beyond, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the largest <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a <unk> <unk> from some part, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who think about evolution as a <unk> <unk> to the time you can't <unk> it.
They're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> DNA <unk> the DNA.
The <unk> that was in the cell cell.
<unk> <unk> <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> has.
It's <unk>, and he <unk> the other <unk> like <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk>.
It's become blue <unk> <unk> that we've <unk>.
And in a short <unk> of time, all the <unk> of a kind of <unk>, and you get it to the <unk>.
All the <unk> are <unk>, and when we <unk> the <unk> <unk>, and when we <unk> the code, you know,
Now, this may be <unk> <unk>, but we can <unk> the software, but we can change things things in a <unk>.
Now, I've been <unk> that here is not about <unk> -- but it's about <unk> -- but about <unk> million years and a half years of evolution, and I've told that maybe we're going to create a new version of <unk> <unk> <unk> in this <unk> <unk>.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk>.
We're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Right for a example: I was born in <unk>.
Now there are three people on the planet for <unk> <unk> in <unk>; there's four years, there will be four years,
We're <unk> problems now at the food, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and a half billion people.
They're more <unk> to do that for nine billion.
<unk> more than five billion <unk>, more than 30 billion <unk>.
That means percent of <unk> a day.
When we're going to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process for <unk>, it's going to be a huge challenge.
We have to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that we're going to be <unk>.
And so we have a <unk> <unk> in the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that they are the <unk> for the future.
The industry <unk> <unk> only a <unk> of <unk>, and think about how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here are data from the reality and our imagination.
Now we have <unk>, thank you to these <unk> <unk>, that we call <unk> <unk>.
We're able to build a <unk> robot that can produce a million <unk>.
Think about <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> of different or try to <unk> <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, you can change, and create more biology in the past years of science.
And it's just a <unk> <unk>.
We can have to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
This is an <unk> of some software software that we're working for <unk> and design species to <unk> and design species to <unk>.
Well, we don't know how they will be.
We know exactly exactly what their <unk> code.
Now we're <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>.
You've seen you who <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We have <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the third generation that we're going to <unk> <unk>, and we have a different <unk>, or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> that would be <unk> the CO2 in the matter of the first, to <unk> cells that can get the first <unk> that we're working for this, and we think we can think we have the first <unk> of the <unk> of the generation.
<unk> light <unk> with the CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> in our <unk>, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we've <unk> in <unk>.
It's <unk> in the ocean, at about about <unk> feet to the <unk> of water.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as the <unk> of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> the CO2, which can be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to <unk> this process.
So we think of a short think we can be able to <unk> what the question of the <unk> <unk>, "which is, we <unk> the <unk> of <unk> the whole industry.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where you can you?
It's a <unk> of energy.
And we're working on the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with the <unk>, we're going back to a year and with a dollar in less when you're going to get the right right.
I think what you can change building <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
Here's how the future could start to look at <unk>, now, the tree, <unk> evolution, <unk> evolution with bacteria, and finally <unk>.
We're <unk> so from the <unk> people.
Our purpose is to do in a way to live enough to try to try to try to try to <unk>. Thank you very much.
First of all I'm going to do, the <unk> possible, some of the new <unk>, that we've got to <unk> a <unk> year ago, almost a year ago. This is <unk>.
It's a environment that you can <unk> it's <unk> to the local level that you can be <unk> on a huge amount of data.
Here we're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, to <unk>, to <unk>, <unk> images like we want.
And it's not how big much of information that we see, how much they are these <unk> of data or images.
Most of the <unk> <unk>, but this for example is a <unk> <unk> <unk>, and I'm going to <unk> <unk>.
It doesn't have any difference because the only thing that we <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen, it's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a book, example of data not images.
This is <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So to <unk> that's just about the <unk> and not images, we can do a thing about this, to see that it's a real <unk> of the <unk>, not a picture.
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a book.
I'm not going to tell you.
This is a <unk> example. It's a number of <unk>.
Every image is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it's really <unk> and the <unk> experience of read the <unk> <unk>, which is to read the <unk>, which is to nature a <unk>.
We also did something with the corner of this <unk> in particular <unk>.
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> much <unk> than that you use in a <unk> <unk>, and we've <unk> <unk>.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or we have any other models, or even <unk>.
And that's really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
So, I think that we've got to <unk> and other <unk>, not <unk> to be <unk>.
Of course, the <unk> is one of the <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this is not going to <unk>, if you don't say that we have <unk> to <unk> this.
These are all the <unk> in the United States, a <unk> image of <unk>.
So now we're going to do something else.
This is actually actually the live on the Web; you can see it.
It's a project called <unk>, which we're going to get two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a very interesting research to the computer very interesting <unk>, a student of Washington, with the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from another another another image of experience to <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here has actually actually a meaning.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> these images, in a way that we're <unk> these images, in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk>. So you see the <unk> of <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk>. So you see the <unk> of a <unk>, and these things are all <unk>.
I don't know if I've got a few other environment.
There are some of a much more <unk>.
I want to go to one of the <unk> data and this <unk> <unk>, and this <unk> <unk> <unk> that we did this this way we've done for the first time to show you what it's really the key to <unk>. And it's not <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk>. And it's not so much <unk> <unk> that we have in the website.
We had to <unk> <unk> and on it.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and <unk> images of the <unk> and <unk> images of the <unk> and saying. We're <unk> <unk> a picture that's <unk> <unk>.
So I'm all <unk> from <unk> and they're all <unk> <unk> <unk> in this way.
And it's possible to <unk> this way.
You know, I would never thought about it.
It's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think I think you see that it's a lot of different kinds of <unk>: from those <unk> <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk>, a number <unk>, <unk> together together in this environment.
And if I can, I'm going to try to try to try those <unk>.
Many are <unk> from <unk>, <unk>.
So, in some part here is a series of <unk> -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> of this environment.
The <unk> is we can do the things with the environment. This is now <unk> data from the <unk> of the whole memory of <unk> as we <unk> the <unk> of view and <unk> all those data.
All those pictures are <unk> together, more than the <unk>.
You have a model of the entire land that <unk>.
So, you think about this as the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on Earth.
It's something that we're going to <unk> them, and the <unk> for people, and the <unk> for the use.
They have <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people.
If somebody comes to the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and I can use it <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>, and they have a social experience.
Of course, a <unk> of all of all, that's <unk> <unk> of every part of the land, <unk> not just <unk> and images <unk>.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I've got a good <unk>? What's going to do is that to do is that in the next years, all of the <unk> <unk> of anybody in the world are <unk> <unk> together?
<unk>: Yeah. What's doing it.
It's <unk>, if you want, you, in images.
And it's doing it in the <unk> of the images.
The thing is very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information that many of these <unk> images.
As you do it a research of images on the Web, you get a <unk> and the <unk> on the page has a lot of the information about the images.
Now, what happens if that picture you get to all your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that we're really huge <unk>. It's a <unk> effect.
CA: <unk>, it's really incredible.
<unk>: I'm going to tell you very much.
One of the <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> of the <unk> is the <unk> that we can't <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the past the past, the past the <unk> <unk>, the past <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I think the <unk> <unk> <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk>, or that <unk> are still <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, or <unk>, <unk>, or <unk>, <unk> <unk>, to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>, to remember the <unk> <unk>, and that the idea that the idea that the idea that the world that we have not only <unk>, but it's just a <unk> of the world, but it's's <unk>.
the <unk> of a particular particular <unk> of choices that our <unk> has done, or <unk>, a lot of <unk>.
And of course, all of course, all of course of the <unk> <unk>.
All <unk>. <unk>.
We're <unk> <unk>.
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death, so we're not <unk>, and <unk> --
We all have a art art.
What we <unk> is the <unk> of the song, the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter that the <unk> of the <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>.
He was my <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk>, on the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
All these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> to think, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of them are.
And, if you get a second, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> that <unk> the planet and important is important for the <unk> <unk> as the <unk> <unk>.
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk>, and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk>, dreams, <unk>, <unk> ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> ideas, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> ideas, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is the <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we can be in how <unk> species.
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is success.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all the species was, or it's about <unk>, because it's <unk>, or -- it's <unk>, or -- you don't <unk> to be <unk> -- and you don't even even <unk> to <unk> <unk> -- that that's that <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> on this planet.
One language is not <unk> only from a <unk> or a series of rules.
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the middle of the which <unk> of every culture comes in the world.
Every language is a <unk> of the mind, a <unk>, a thought, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we're here in <unk>, at least half the <unk> is not more <unk> in the <unk>.
They're not more <unk> to children, which means, to say, <unk>, <unk>, something that's <unk>.
What there's more <unk> of being <unk> from the <unk>, of being the last to talk about a language, of the <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the children?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in some of every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks, a <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I know somebody of you know, "is not better?
The world would not be a better place if we all <unk> all the same language? "<unk>, then we're going to talk about <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> thing that's going to talk about your language.
I'd like to give you a <unk> journey.
a little <unk> journey in the <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us <unk> that when I say, "I mean," I mean, "I mean," I mean, "I mean," I mean,
And I'm going to be <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that's not to <unk> the blue color because the blue color, because the <unk> <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule, <unk> <unk>, "<unk>" you have to <unk> a different person that's a different <unk>.
All that's <unk> in the past <unk>, <unk> is that in these families that you're going to talk about six or seven <unk> <unk> <unk>, nobody's <unk>.
You're going to go and then you're going to talk about.
I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> with the <unk>, which I've got the <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They've done <unk> from the top of the <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> <unk> <unk>, had never seen anything of <unk>.
They <unk> the picture from land, they <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk>, and not <unk>, they have <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> five <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk>.
They're <unk> between them.
<unk> percent was <unk> from their <unk>.
We're <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two cases of death and when we've been <unk> for, they have <unk>, and then they <unk> them. And then they <unk> the same. And then they <unk> the same. And then they <unk> it.
<unk> were able to recognize the <unk> animal from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species.
<unk> years old, I was <unk> a very interesting <unk>, when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
So to give you a sense of the <unk>, I would have to understand the culture and that the <unk> is not <unk>.
It's pretty much of a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Very interesting.
If you're going to <unk> the big <unk> of the world, what did?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
A continent is always <unk> out of the <unk>. And instead of course, you know, it's not <unk>. And instead of the other <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> relationship between the <unk> and death.
So <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> from <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk>.
So, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk> <unk>.
We're <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And the moment you're <unk>, is the spirit that you can <unk>, you can <unk> <unk>?
So you're going to <unk> these incredible events: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> all the <unk> with the <unk> that I've got the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a <unk> continent of <unk>, this <unk> is never <unk> <unk>.
And I'm <unk> from a <unk>, but their <unk> is <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> from the families of <unk>, and they live in a world, and they live in a <unk> world, and <unk> in <unk> <unk> for 18 years.
Two years <unk> <unk>.
So, to the values of their society, who <unk>, values that <unk> and just their <unk> and just their <unk> <unk> --
At the <unk> of this <unk>, they <unk> <unk> out and <unk> out of the first time, at the age of 18, see a <unk>. And that's in the first <unk>, when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, all that they have learned learned the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and he <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>, and he <unk> says, <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>? <unk> how I said.
It's <unk>. Now it's about you <unk>. "
They're <unk> <unk> and say that we, <unk> <unk>, we're the <unk> of the world.
This level level of <unk> is extremely important.
When we think of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk>, and the old <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> idea in his <unk>, or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these are more <unk> to the Earth of us.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk>.
There's no space for these things in <unk> <unk>, or in <unk> <unk>, but you've created a <unk> of the Earth, they created a <unk> of the Earth of the Earth <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. But on a <unk>, <unk>, but on a <unk>, it's <unk>, because it can live in the <unk>.
What does it mean?
<unk> <unk> that <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> and have a human spirit, it will be a different human relationship to be a different relationship with the mountain of the <unk> that, or that place, which is a <unk> of a mountain that <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> that <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
which is the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world.
I'm <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> for being <unk> to be <unk>.
That <unk> me a different human <unk> from my friends that believe that <unk> are the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
If we're going to <unk> that these <unk> can create different, <unk>, we start to understand some <unk> <unk>.
I've <unk> this picture at <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> is not the potential <unk>, but his <unk>. It's <unk> from two elements.
So, in a side, this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> that they do a different <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> to be <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> of electricity. <unk>'t make a <unk> of the reality; it's <unk> <unk>.
I often <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, with his <unk> <unk>.
<unk> my <unk> can't tell you these <unk> as you can't tell you about nobody to tell you nobody to be <unk>. <unk> <unk>, because they can't be <unk> because they're <unk> <unk>, because they're <unk> from a <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> <unk>, if we can <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk>.
Now, it's the <unk> that are in this <unk> <unk>, <unk> are <unk> <unk>, the same kind of <unk> for <unk>. The question: <unk> <unk> <unk>: in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, like these <unk> <unk> <unk>, like these <unk> to <unk> <unk>. But if you think that's <unk> <unk>, which is that if you're going to be <unk> <unk>.
We use the big <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if we're going to <unk>, we <unk> <unk>. "
What does it mean?
This <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, who <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes in the the same species.
If you <unk> them as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, the rest of plants, the rest of the plants, I said," No. "
The solution is: you get the <unk> <unk> in a night of the moon and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk>.
And so, you don't get <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk>.
Now, <unk> the problem is that even the problem is that even the heart <unk> <unk> them, but in some way we're <unk>, but some way we're <unk> to the <unk> of the history of our world, and over over.
In fact, the <unk> century, in 300 years, not <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk>, but rather as the <unk> was that we <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> of the planet. Now the problem is not the planet. Now the problem. Now the problem. Now,
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new <unk> of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, they don't have <unk> when they put them from the <unk> and <unk> like that <unk> don't have <unk> to be <unk> when they have <unk> from <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> <unk>. It's the power. It's the power.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
And if you look at the world, you know that these are not <unk> <unk>.
They're <unk> and <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> that go over their ability to their ability to <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> that has been <unk> in the forest to a generation, and now <unk> to <unk> and now <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk>, where <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm going to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk>.
Or, in the case of the <unk>, they're <unk> with the discovery of <unk>.
If we <unk> on the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> of the <unk>.
As <unk> <unk>, <unk> physics, <unk> physics, it's <unk> to <unk>, but <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, but <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, not just <unk>, but <unk> <unk> in certain certain <unk>, because it does a <unk> <unk>, because it's part of the development of the development.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you can't be part of the beginning.
I've got the <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk>, but we've got to <unk> with a young <unk>, but just <unk> to <unk> that we've been <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
So the <unk> that's been <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk>.
It was <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> at the age of two years, <unk> <unk> because he didn't have a <unk> of him, because he didn't have a <unk>.
<unk>, who did the same, it was <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
A day has <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and, for this <unk>, it was <unk> to the <unk> for seven years.
<unk> <unk> can be <unk>, but the spirit of the <unk> is from <unk> <unk>.
And then, it's all <unk> to a choice.
What's going to live in the <unk> world, we want to <unk> the world?
The big <unk> <unk>, before he said that his <unk> <unk>, but a day was that, in our <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world, not only <unk> the whole <unk> of the imagination of the imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination, but a day a day, <unk> <unk> that were other <unk>.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
<unk> <unk>, which has given us us, that <unk>, which <unk> us to the <unk>, <unk> the <unk>, and we talk about <unk> <unk>, and we talk about <unk> <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world <unk> has been <unk> <unk>.
That <unk> story, I don't know we have the answers that we <unk> to all the challenges that we can come.
When we're going to do these <unk> of the world is to say, we're <unk> with <unk> different <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the chance to be what we're: a <unk> species, that's a <unk> species, that's to <unk>. And there are big moments of <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> of the island of <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and this man, <unk> me, and this man, I <unk> the <unk> story of his <unk>.
The government <unk> is not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and 50 to <unk> our <unk>, we have <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, <unk> for his life, <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, and all the <unk>, and all of his <unk>.
You know that <unk> don't <unk> the <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> from the night or <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> on, you know, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> in their hand. When I did it <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> has <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, he <unk> a dog.
It's <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk>, and it's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So I'm going to talk about <unk>? <unk>. And that, in different ways, <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> and all the <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> the government has <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> area of <unk> <unk> and <unk> together.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>.
One example of how a <unk> <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, I think, it's pretty <unk> at least who's been in these <unk> of the planet, we <unk> that they're not <unk>.
For somebody is home.
<unk> <unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> of hope.
So we have <unk> <unk> <unk>, we've <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> never <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> --
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. But we believe that stories can change the world, and we're the best <unk> to tell stories of the world. Every month our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> from millions.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to our public places of <unk> <unk>, and we have to find a <unk> <unk> from which <unk>, and they <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and we have to find a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> world, and we have to find a <unk> world.
where the <unk> <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I've been doing this book that I hope you've got a <unk>, in case, in case, in case, in the case, in the case, I'm going to be <unk>.
I'd like to start with what I call the <unk> <unk>. "
<unk> <unk> <unk>?
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we we want to <unk> the <unk> of our <unk> <unk>."
The reason is, from the side, in fact that the freedom is in the same value, is <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to human beings.
And we're going to do that if we're <unk>, each of us can <unk> to do all that we <unk> our <unk>, no one that we <unk> in our own own own name.
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk>.
The choices people have, more <unk>, and more is their freedom, and more is their freedom, is their <unk>.
This, <unk>, it's so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the <unk> is possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I <unk> a simple <unk> on the <unk>.
In my <unk> <unk> there, there's <unk>, without <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy a huge <unk> of <unk> that you can buy a huge number of <unk> that nobody <unk> <unk> <unk> that nobody <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that nobody <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which nobody <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that nobody nobody <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which nobody <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that nobody nobody have have already <unk> <unk> <unk>
Here's what the <unk>.
Then you go to the <unk> <unk> for a <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> <unk>, there's a big number of <unk>.
We can make six million of different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> that there is <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: The world of the <unk>.
And I was a child, when I was a child, they could get all the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
You know, the phone, you don't get it.
One of what's <unk>, between the other, it was that the phone never <unk>.
These are <unk>.
Now we have a <unk> <unk>, especially between the <unk>.
Here's the <unk>.
My <unk> is what's in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, and <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
If you have no <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, you're <unk> in the <unk>, you're <unk>.
And what's the end is that people <unk> in <unk> and it does this question. And you know, the answer is the answer? The answer is, "No."
It's not possible to buy a phone that doesn't <unk> things.
So, in other other things that are much more important than the <unk>, you know, the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: It's not going on the United States that you're going to do.
Instead, <unk> from the <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we could do it, or" <unk>, "<unk>," <unk> <unk>, these <unk> and these <unk> <unk>. What you want to do? "
You know, "<unk>, what do you do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> <unk> these <unk> and these <unk>."
"What you want to do?"
And you said, "<unk> if she was, what you know?"
And the <unk>: "But I'm not going to have her."
So, we call the "<unk> <unk>," <unk>, <unk> that it's a beautiful thing.
But it's not that one <unk> the weight and the responsibility of the decisions of the decisions of the decisions of the <unk>, to <unk>, to <unk>, to <unk> that's <unk> -- and so not about fact, and it's not <unk> to take it for the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk> <unk>, <unk> to people like me, and you, you know, you think it's not a sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk> them?
The answer is that they want to <unk> the <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
And we're going to be the <unk> is a question of choice, you know, you know, you can't want to <unk> the children. "You don't want to <unk> the children." You're not going to <unk>.
And we can <unk> them.
So the <unk>, <unk>, you have to <unk>, you have to decide that kind of person.
I'm going to <unk> to the family, a <unk> perspective, and I almost anyone, it was that we <unk> the <unk>, and you can <unk> to <unk> children the <unk> possible.
The only choice was with who, when, and I don't even know what we do after.
<unk>, all is really <unk>.
They're going to go very smart, and they <unk> their 20 percent in less than work.
And not because they're less <unk>, because they're not <unk>.
But why they're <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> or not? "
"<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>? I have to think about the children or the career?"
They're <unk> <unk>.
And they're going to answer these questions, even if this <unk> <unk>, you don't get a lot of <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to do that. They're important.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, like <unk> <unk>, because technology <unk> us to work every day, from every day of the the planet, <unk> that we <unk> from the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I'm not going to tell you nobody, where the works.
I'm not going to tell you, because I want to use it.
What means, this incredible freedom to do that? It's we have to work? It's we have to <unk>, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our <unk>, with the phone in a <unk>, with the <unk>, and the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, on <unk>.
And even if they're all <unk>, every minute that we see our <unk> <unk>, we're also <unk>, "I have to <unk> this called?"
"I have to <unk> this <unk>? I have to <unk> this <unk>?"
And also when the answer is, "No, this makes the experience of your <unk> <unk>, very different than the experience of the <unk> that would be other.
So, we look at all, things and <unk>, things and <unk> materials and <unk> and <unk> of life, life is a question of choices.
And one time the world was this: <unk>, there were some <unk>, but it was a question of choice.
The world of today we're going to do this: <unk> is a <unk> thing, or <unk>? "
The answer is <unk>.
<unk> <unk> them all of all, so I'm going to talk about those <unk>.
So, we have two two two <unk>, <unk> on people.
The first, <unk>, is that it <unk> <unk>.
And so many <unk> of the <unk> that you, it's very difficult to do.
I'm going to give you a <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> society <unk>, with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What she found it's found for every 10 that are <unk> in the most, the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
With 50 percent <unk>, there's 10 percent in less than <unk>, when they're <unk>. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> of the <unk> that you have, and the choice is <unk> to <unk>.
And at <unk>, and again, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, you can't have it.
It's not just that these <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>, because they don't have enough enough money, even that decision is so <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> of work.
They're not <unk>, they're <unk> to five <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of work, which would be <unk>.
So the <unk> is a <unk> of the <unk> to have <unk>.
And I think that's the world.
"And to end, for the <unk>: <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
They're going to take the right decision, if it's the <unk>, right?
You don't want to get the <unk>, and <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
So that's the first effect. The second is that if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice, to the <unk> and make a choice, to the end of how you have to be less <unk> of what you have.
And that's going to be different reasons.
One of these is that with many <unk> of the <unk> that you can do, if you have a <unk>, is not a <unk>, is easy choice that would be better. And that's what happens is that it's the <unk> that's going to <unk> us to <unk> us to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk>,
And even when it was an <unk> decision.
The choices is more choices is easy to <unk> of any <unk> that is <unk> of any <unk>.
<unk>, there's what <unk> <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very good <unk> as the value that we <unk> things from what we <unk>.
And then, when there are many <unk>, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> of the <unk> that's choice.
Here's a example. I'm going to <unk> with all the New York.
But it's what we probably <unk>.
There's this <unk> to the <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>. It's all about them.
It's not <unk>. But that he's <unk>. "Well, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"<unk> my <unk> are on <unk>."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of the home."
And it's two weeks from the idea that's <unk> -- every day -- the chance to <unk> where you want.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for that we have, even when the choice was <unk>.
And the most <unk> that we have from <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> says a lot of things.
We're going to live the moment, and maybe in the live.
But the most important is that any of you, you're going to do other.
The things that we don't have many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
I tried to my skin <unk> a new <unk>.
It's almost always <unk>.
A time, the <unk> were <unk>, <unk> them and <unk> <unk>, they were <unk>, just after <unk> <unk>, and <unk> a lot of times, and they're going to go.
So, I'm going to <unk> a new when those <unk> were <unk>, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
<unk> <unk> said, "<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>?"
You want them to <unk> or with the <unk>? "<unk>" or "<unk>?"
"What's going to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> them or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little bit, I've been <unk>, "I want the kind of <unk>, which was the only <unk>." It was so for a <unk> now. I'm going to <unk> me, and then the best <unk> <unk>, with the best <unk> that I've ever had ever <unk>.
It was the <unk>.
But it's <unk> me.
Why? I wrote a book for <unk>.
The reason I was <unk> with all the <unk> of the choice of my <unk> were <unk>.
I had <unk> <unk>. I'm not going to get anything about when we're going to get a <unk>, but when we've got a kind of be a <unk>.
What I had <unk> was good, but not a perfect.
After <unk> what I was <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in life of the people don't do that <unk> the <unk> that these <unk> <unk>.
And that's good <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of the <unk> if you get it.
Because if you're not <unk> of what I'm talking about.
The truth <unk> <unk>.
"You know, when he was the <unk> <unk>," The reason that was better when he was more than the when he was <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world we live in -- <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and we can <unk> is that things are in the <unk>.
You've never <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, my <unk>, you know, my <unk>, you know.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- it's: "<unk> <unk>" <unk>, "Yeah, you want."
I mean, small <unk> -- that I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I could not have to do it, I'm not <unk>.
But we're not always a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk> of buy a couple of <unk> <unk> when you're not just that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you will you say, "Why?"
"Who's <unk>?" "" "" ""
The world is the <unk>. What I could do?
When there are hundreds of <unk>, and they <unk> a <unk>, and you get a <unk>, and you <unk>, it's <unk> that the <unk> you are.
They could do it better.
And with hundreds of <unk> available, there's not <unk> for <unk>.
So when people do, even if the result is <unk>, you get <unk> and <unk> them to them them.
In the last years, the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- I'm going to be <unk>, because the <unk> are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation that <unk> is.
So the final result is that we're better, <unk>, but we're going to <unk> it.
So you know, you know.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we all take for good and it's completely <unk>. It's not true.
There's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than it, but it's not <unk>. But it's not a lot of choice is better than a little bit.
There's a <unk> <unk>, <unk>. I don't know what it's.
But I'm sure we've got <unk> from a piece of the level of the <unk> of our life.
Now, from the point of view, I've been <unk> -- from the point of view, the <unk> is the <unk>.
What it <unk> all this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you have <unk>, where the problem is not that <unk>.
The problem is that they have too <unk>.
So, to <unk> that I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> society.
And that's what <unk> does and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> you about how <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, it's not just <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk>.
They do it better.
If you have a little bit of what we <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>. The people are too few <unk>, it would be too much of them, it would be <unk>, but our life to be our life.
This is what <unk> <unk> call.
A <unk> of the <unk> of all -- not just to the poor people -- because because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk> us.
So to <unk>: "<unk>, you can become all that you want to --
<unk>, people, <unk>: "But what's what's going to do that fish?"
"It's <unk> that you can't get anything in a <unk> of the <unk>."
"A <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk>,"
And I <unk> it, I <unk> this, at the beginning.
But then, <unk>, I <unk>, I <unk> that fish knows that fish knows.
Because the reality of the <unk> is that if you're <unk> in <unk>, the way, you can't <unk> the freedom.
If you look at the <unk> way that everything we <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, and <unk> the <unk>.
All they need a <unk>.
This is almost too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and <unk> for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk>, and <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you.
