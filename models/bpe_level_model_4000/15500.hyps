I just just show these slides of the slide to show that the calculation of artica, which for almost three million years has had the size of 48 United States of the 48 United States of the 408 percent.
But this undervalue of gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the exhibition of the ice.
The article is article -- in a certain sense, the clear heart of the climate system of global climate system.
You get a walls and you reach it into extremely it.
The next slide is going to be a quick carrelled the southern 25 years.
The eyes are signed in red red in red red red in red red red in red red by red.
As you see it, they get the blue blue box,
That's the ice in inverness, which you reports in the summer.
You can see the cost ice cosidential cosid" -- is like blood, which is like blood out of the body.
In 25 years is spent by this way.
This is a problem because the re-scale of the very interesting terraildy of the artical ocean artical amount of carbon congelated that we are transformed by microbes.
And I think of the totality of the atmosphere is global warming, that amount could double, superhitty this point of not report.
In some deep falls in Alaska methanks the metan is already rebolling from the water.
The professorse Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was reckey with a team -- low-low-based lake lake in the last inver.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: Look, it's good. The question is if we're going to be a lot of us is going to be well.
A reason is that this is that this extra termal scale of the Groenland from the north.
This is a glacial phrase in glacial.
The ported never reached levels of the website has never reached levels of the door.
This is the Kangerlussuaq, in the Southeraq, in the Groenland of Groenland,
If you want to know how the site level of the sea ice of the sea ice of the sea.
These are increasingly increasingly.
Another part of the planet: Actickes, the biggest block of the planet.
The last month of the scientists have delighted that the ice of the ice is in negative, and that Antarcticket Antarctical on some underwater on some underwater on some underwater on some of the underwater --
And it is six meters of water, like in Groenland, like Groenland,
Himalaya, the third biggest third of the ice block -- you see new laghi, who are a few years ago were ice of away.
The 40-percent of the world's world's population reported water from the bottom of the monkey.
South Ande: This ice is the bottom of the water water from this city.
The portraised is increased.
But when I diminuisces, the same thing happens.
In California neve on the Sierra Nevada is deminual of the 40-percent.
The hydrop-hydrops.
The previsions, as you have ready, they're grave.
The search growing in the world door a remarkable of the including leading of the including world of incencies.
The environmental disasters are increasing a re-out of the normal and previous precedents.
Four most numbers over the last 30 years of the previous precedents.
This is a gone of the whole whole whole thing.
If you look at the history if you can see it in the context if you can see the consequences.
On the last five years we add 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the areas of the Pacific, from Americh, which is in the subject of the suburban continent in the suburban continent in the ocean imor of the oxygen in the ocean or in the oceans.
The bigger cause, global warming, and the deforestation, which is 20, it's the use of fuel fuel uses fuel fuels.
On oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries with China.
And it was proponent to build a lot of other carbon carbon did.
But we're assisting a change of direction.
These are the annulled around the last few years and some degrees of alternative veres.
In every way, there's a political lotta in our country.
The carbon industry and oil industry has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon the carbon and the carbon on the last year to promoty and oxymore.
This image is reminminds me somewhere --
Veras Natral Tennessee, where I live, there was a loss-scale of carbon digging of carbon dixize.
Maybe you saw it on the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of news.
This is the biggest flush in America.
It's happened around Natal.
The natalien in one of the carbon industry was this:
Video: Frosty the carbon dioegry is a kind of hallegry.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is always more cleaner and more cleaner and more cleaner and more cleaner.
It's good price, adorable, adorables, and they keep the work are going to be deal.
Al Gore: From here is a big part of the West Virginia.
The biggest bigger society on the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his friend.
Video: Don Blankenship: Sarmed -- Al Gore Gore, Nancy Pelove, Harry Reid -- not know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clima Proteteer of Clima has launched two campaigns.
This is a baby, a part.
Video: Attor: Attor: ALergigives we see climate changes like a seria to our business.
So our priority is to invest a big amount of money.
In fact, carbon is not spore.
We think it's cleaned -- has a good profum.
So not predicted.
Let me do it.
Video: Attor: Carbone pulled -- you heard a lot of it.
So let's do it a structure of a structure of the fuel of the fuel of carbon be.
Straordinary cars are a little roundaries, but this is the sound of the fuel of the fuel of the fuel of the carbon technology --
The carbon is between the main the global warming cause, but the night-technology of carbon distring technology that you see it changes everything.
To a eye: this is the odiernice technology of carbon dierness,
Al Gore: Infind, the alternative alternative is connected to the economic economic and in that of national security.
Video: Commention: The America is in crisi; the national economy, the national crisis.
The filo that the connection is our dependence from fossil fuel fuel fuel and oil oil oil oil and oil oil oil oil and oil oil oil oil and oil oil oil importance.
Now, yet, there's a new new solutions to use circcle for users.
Real America: 100-year-old, in 10 years.
A plan to report America to work, and make it sure that we can make sure that global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
Real America. Scover more
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: Commention: It's about re-energy to America.
One of the fastest ways of making the dependence from the buster of the buster of the buster of our planet.
Comparsa: The future is here. You know, the future is here.
It is two 2: Novi investments for a lot of work well well retribs.
Commention: Reer America. It's time of being realists.
Al Gore: A proverbbbby proverbs says, "If you want to go speak from soldiers.
If you want to go away away from them, go together."
We need to go away away away now.
Thank you very much.
LHC. I got a introduction on LHC.
And I promise to the way you get back to how the machine is working.
So I mean, there's no one time -- the other time I don't have her, LHC is the biggest scientific experiment, the biggest scientific experiments -- 27 miles of circle.
His the way to reach the conditions that were less than a billion years of the universe -- the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million a second.
This is just all of this is just the same thing.
This is the Ginevra.
We Fotographic these min-Big Bang in the reduce reduce of it.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is a 44 meters and has a behind 22 feet and a diameter of 22 feet.
This is a spectacular image of ATLS in built so you can see the proportions.
The 10 sect is last year we have accesor the car for the first time.
And this photograph was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immense in the room of control.
It's a image of the first fashion particles that had done all the LHC, entering collision, deliberately, with a part of LHC, and spread particles inside the reach particles.
In other words, when we see that one is 10 secember, we realized that the machine is a great living.
I don't know if it was going to do more than anybody or this, when somebody went on Google and lives that the beginning was this:
That means that we had a cultural impact cultural impact,
About a week later, it was a problem with the car, he had to these movies here -- these films -- these dorders.
These are 13,000 prints when the car workers works, the massive sit of potence.
Now, the technical of you will look at the films and dird, "It's not true. It's not true. It's too underlying to the too under."
And instead of it can do it because when they're very free cosident cosident co-conductors.
So, at least 271 degrees, a smoker temperature in the stars, these films can bring that current of the stelles, these films can bring that current to the current of the space between the stelles, these films can bring that current that currently in the stars, these films can bring that current the stelles, these films can bring that current that current of the space, these films can bring that current in the stelles, these stelles, these
In one of the most nine has been nine in the LHC, there was a difeter of fabrication.
So the films will be ready, and 13,000 feet of suddenly met a electricity of electricity that they meet a electrical resistence meeting a electricity.
This was the result.
Now, this is more impression if you think that these magnets, and that these magnets, and that are slower of 20 tons of 30 centimetris.
It's damamn about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to take them to the them, what we did is doing.
We have repristined and justed off.
Now, I'm going back to their underneath their underground place.
I take the end of the marge LHC will be new intea.
And we would like it and we expect to get the right data or him, and continue and continue and continue and continue to find out what the morning, the morning.
Now, of course, in a certain quest of the way, these accidents reaccendending the debate of science and engineering the engineering of the engineering of the engineering of the science and engineering of the frontier.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyons, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I would like to conclude with the words of a scientist, Humphrey Davy, the way, the image, the way, the defense of his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, he said, "No is a lot of dangerous -- "Nither the ideas of the ideas of the ideas of the ideas of the ideas of the ideas of the human reporting of science is definitely deed, that our tries are completely completely completely completely money.
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about how to do you get the morning.
As you get it as you get them and make it it so much and move them and move them, and you get it really solved and solved and solve the resolution.
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us.
So, by informath the inspired of our interaction with physical objects with physical objects with my Pac, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi, I started asking her, I started asking her, instead of having the mouse of the mouse of the mouse that you move on a digital deal that you move on a digital deal that you can make a digital information with the information with both of the hands,
and we get it to our pleasure pleasure to get it to our pleasure to system?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable computer.
In a few words, a Siftable computer.
You can move with the hand the hand they can see their motion and they have a screens and a radio wireless and a radio wireless radio wireless and a radio wireless radio wireless and a radio wireless and they have a screening out the wireless and they have a screen's movement and they have a screen."
But most of course, are physics, like the morning, you can just move on the morning, you can just move it just down.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate information digital information.
And as they get more physics, you know, the way, you know, the right of the movement, and as they become more physics, and they become more physics, and they get more physics, and they are moving and functions, and we can explorate new and funny of interaction.
I started with some simple example.
This Siftable is confifigured to show vide: if you walk it in a direction, the video rooters it will root it down from the other hand back.
These are interactive of the other active of others.
If you take them to me what they are going to be done.
If they come back and they can get a little bit of a little bit.
If they come back and they can get a little bit of a little bit.
They also have their movement and inclination.
We then realized that one of the interesting interesting of the interaction was the common to the data, and you can be a color, as if it was a color, like a color, like a color, like it was a color.
In this case, we have three Siftable confident like a wall-up and I can use them to the color in the central in the central in the central in the central in the central in the central one of the color in the central boyes.
and I can use them to switch that in the central color in the central bound.
If we are too much better and we can reach a little bit of it.
And it also also is the possibility of learning as languages, the mathematics and games of logical things that people can try and see the speed things and see the results of the results of the immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacy of Fibonacy that I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a words of words that is in the Scarabeo and Boggle.
Prently, every turning of the saves a literal case on every Siftable, Prently, in every turning of the Siftable, and while you're looking at the Siftable, and while you're looking at a dictionary about a dictionary.
And then, after about 30 seconds of a remiss and have a new set of letters and new possibility to try and new possibility to try it.
Thank you.
This is what the children came in the Middle in Lab, I did it so that I tried them and I went a video video.
They are pleasure a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things of this kind of interesting interesting is that you don't have to give you a lot of educations.
You just say, "Hee," and they know exactly what to do.
That's how other people who try it.
This is our head young head young tester than the young head.
It actually wanted to be just just a clar.
They were just morning, for him.
Now, this is an apply of a cartone of interactive.
We wanted to build a tool for the apply of the Hux. He is Felix.
It can be able to put new characters in the scene in the scene of their associated associated with it.
It can be able to put new characters in the scene in the scene of their associated associated with it.
So that's doing the sun.
Video: The sole is surgence.
David Merrill: Now it took a treatment in the scene.
Video: The arancient treat.
Bel work! Si! Y!
So when I think Siftable and put the closer can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
by making the story.
Video: Ho!
DM: It's a story with the open open up and it can decide him how you want.
DM: It's a story with the open open up and it can decide him how you want.
Video: Gulo, Gulo, God via, gace.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, I did this is a tool, to campionate and exeguing music.
It's a tool, I did this recently, to save and exeguing and exeguing music.
Siftable here act from suons like based on low-based based and bacteria it.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what use.
You can insert these sounds in a sequence of compounds your pleasure to your pleasure and pleasure to your pleasure in a sequence of the soubt of inserved.
And it just just just touch it just touch a sounds and a "sequence."
These are actually that you can control from living as the reverse and the filter and filter and filter and filter and the filter and the filter and the filter and the filter and the movie.
You attach it to a particular sum and then including it.
And then there are actually general like time and fly ly ly the whole whole sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We will start putting a basic in two Siftable "sequenc," we can go in a seriously, we put another low.
Now I put a baby line of bassroom.
Video: Now, I add percent use --
Video: DM: And I put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the effect of the living living from the living way.
Video: I can speak the whole whole whole thing on the time by a bunch or from the other.
Video: DM: And I will add the bottom to give more expression.
Video: I can recombining the sequence ""fle."
So I don't have to plann, but I can sudden, you can make it longer longer or more time.
And now, finally, I ended up the whole whole thing is going to leave the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces man-machine is to build new new interfaces how our brains and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this lost is a little bit of a perator.
The concept I want to transmit is that it's coming this new generation of objects designed to interact with digital digital media in our world in our world in the way we want to do it in the way we want to get this new generation of the way we want to transform.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk about all of you.
I'm a written written a writer.
And I want to be books is my profession, but it's more than this, obviously.
It's also love love and the fell of my life.
And I don't expect that it can change.
But I said that, something particularly happened recently in my life and I can take me to realibrate the whole realibrate with this work.
The particular thing is that I was written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Prega, Prega, Prega, and I became a lot of my books, for some reason that he used to some right now in the world and became a big thing, you know, and it became a big deal --
And the result is that everywhere you go now, people treat me like if I was condanning.
It is true -- condanning -- condannata!
They go from me to me all worried and say, "Do you have no way to do better than to do better.
You don't have a papers to write all the life without able to be able to create a book that can care of a book that can care of someone hon?"
that can care about someone one?"
It's rassical, you know.
But it could go worst worst the worst of 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent -- I was a written written -- I wanted to be a written written a write written years ago,
I go up to the same based on the same foundation from the land.
And people say, "Don't you have to succeed?
You don't have a fear that the rate of the reject kill?
You don't papers to do this mestiate for all the life without anything that you ever come out and die on a heart of snine skills with the mouth-shown with the mests of failed failure?"
So so I mean, you know.
The answer -- the short response to all these questions is "Yes."
I am papers of all those things.
I always had land.
And I also have a lot of other things that people might not ink.
As the allow and other things spaving on.
But as it is about the writing what I was thinking about it, and I asked me to ask me about the be?
Is it rational?
It's just that anyone who should expect to be pushed by a work that you feel about to do.
But what is that particularly in the impredative of making it nervvvent to the living healthy in a way that other career not to do it?
As my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked
It never was -- that block of the engineer John, how do it happen?
It wasn't working on this, right?
Only, the chemical engineers like group don't have certainly, in the secooled the reputation of being alcolilighted the reputation of being alcolight.
We written enough this reputation and not only writers but creatives of every general, we have this reputation of being enormously profitting in order to be enormously instable to be enormously profitting and reputation of all these reputation of every general,
And not really, that look at the contact of the magnificent of the magnificent of the magnificent century, only in the twentientientientirely in the twentientiential twist.
And even those who don't have suicide seem to be really, I made from their womans.
Norman Mailer, before I died, in the last interview said, "Oh, my my book has killed me a little bit more extraordinary about the work of their life.
But we don't bate the boundition when we hear these things so much long, we heard this so we have completely interior and accepted the notion that creativity and the notion are somehow to be somehow ready, and the end, and the wind, and it will be on the hand, and the wind, and the end, and the end, and the end, and the notion is going to be somewhere we are reading and the door and the enjoy
And the question I want to bring all of this idea?
You have good this thing -- because you look at this thing is a hundreds of distance to me not good, it's good for anything that supposed to do that supposition.
I think it's odied.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our big minds creative mind.
And I certainly know that, in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to be dark towards that I was dark in the constitude of the circumstances where in my career.
And so it looks like that, but look like that. I have about 40 years.
I have still about four decade in my work in me.
And it's very likely to say that anything write he wrote the world as the work that he did after the work that he did after the last book.
He slavery, because we're all more than my own here -- is likely to my greatest is to my greatest is to my shoulder.
Oh, Gesood, which think!
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads to a person to start band I don't want to do it.
I would just just go to this work we do.
So, the question is becoming like, right?
And so so I think, after a lot of reflection that the way of work to continue and write is to create a psychological cook?
I have a few way to find a safety of security between me, which I'm writing and my natural ang is where he wrote to the whole year later model of how to do it starts to look through the time, trying to find other societies to see if they could have the best ideas and healthy and healthy and healthy healthy and healthy and healthy and more blood and more blooking.
as to help people create the people create the emotional responses of creative creative responses of creative creative life.
And that research took me to the Greek and ancient Room.
See because it goes back in the circle and then you go back and back.
In the Greek and ancient Rome -- people don't seem to believe that creativity became the creative came to man, OK?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit and that came out of men from a few disranging and unknown -- and unknown away.
The greenens called these demonishes of creativity "demon."
Socry, wonderful created that he had a demone that you would be a smother's shift from far away.
The Romans were the same idea, but they called that kind of spirit without a genium.
The thing is great, because the Romans didn't think that a genius was a kind of smart somebody particularly intelligence.
They create that a gene of this sort of divine in which he created literally in the study of the study of a artist, a little bit like the elpho Dobby, and who came out of the article of the artical work of the article of the artical job and modeled the result of that work.
And therefore -- -- -- -- this is the distance of which I talk -- that cooking psychological that you protect the results of your work.
And all knew that was so that it worked, right?
So the antic artists were property by certain things, like the too narcissstopping -- right?
If your work was exceptional you couldn't take all the deal and all of the deal that he helped by this genius incorporeo.
If your fail, it wasn't all all of your fail, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a unable to be a unable to be a unable to be a incapable to be a inabout.
And so people han conception in Occicident Occicidents for a long time.
And then the Rindicate and all over and changed this great idea; we put the human beings of the universe in the middle of the universe and the mysteries and the mysteries that write in creatures that write the detail of device.
This was the kind of the human rational of the rational human remain and people started thinking that creativity came out of the divide of the ish.
And for the first time in history, you start to reference this or a genius like a genius rather than a person with a little bit of a genium.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big mistake wrong.
I think that allows to someone one is a simple person to believe that being like a recipe of how the found, the essence and the surprising mysteries and the surprising and the surprising is a responsibility to the fragile that human.
It's like to ask someone to teach the sole.
And it degree the whole ego and creates all these ingestors expecting on the lost.
And I think it was this pressure that we have destroying artists in 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think that I think, the question is it going, and there?
Can we do it different?
Maybe you go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and creative mystery creative.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cell 500 years of thinking about rational thinking about about 18 minutes.
And probably there are people in the audience that would be brought to the notion of the notion of the notion of the notion of the notion of the nice of their projects.
I probably won't convince you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to bring is -- because no?
Why don't you think about this way?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that has ever heard of the creative explain to explain the creative process.
A process that is that anybody ever tried to do something -- therefore, fundamentally, all here -- you don't have to rational.
And, in fact, it can be completely paranormal.
I did this recently with the extraordinary poetc. And then it was 90 years old, but it was a little poetry for all life and he said in his childhood in the Virginia, working out of the Virginia, working out in the wall, and I felt it out of the landscapes, and I was the landscape.
She said that it was like a fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous of the air.
And that was rotolding towards of her landscape.
You feel that it turns out to get the land below his feet below his feet.
He knew that I have one thing to do that point and was like, "current."
And so it goes back to home and come home and he would not have to get another piece of paper, and it would not have to take another piece of paper, and a mate fair, collecting the page and it on the page.
Sometimes it can't be quite fast and correct and correct and correct and the poetry the rotolate the rotolwing the rote and her hand her hand her hand her hand and then it would continued to roll the landscape, as he said, "Hey, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you said, "H."
And then there were times -- this piece of not forgotten -- there were moments in which was almost losssend, ok?
So, it was going home and was trying to carry and the hand the past was going through a male right in the way that was passing, and then he said it was like to the other hand the off.
And it was office to the code from the code and the reveal was going on on the page.
And in these cases, the poetry is a perfect paper, and I mean it was the last word at the last word at the first word at the first word at the first one of the last word at the first word at the first one of the last word at the first word at the first word at the first one of the last word at the first one of the last word at the first one of the last word at the first one of the first first one of the last word at the first one of the last time.
So when I felt I felt about -- is just fair, it's exactly the skin.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a conductura!
I'm a mult, and my way of work is -- I sweke me on the same orary every day and work on the back and work on the hand work on the hously.
But even I did, in my head -- I was going on on on that thing, I was just just like this thing, in time.
And I imagine that many of you do the han done.
You know, even if the work and ideas came out of a certain found, I couldn't honestly know.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to it in a way that we don't lose the head -- pluttoo, which is that you do it?
And so much as I reveil -- the best contemporary example I have is the musician musician is musician in the time ago for a journeal.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life was the incarnation of the article of the articking, trying to control these species of impulsizing these species of impulses creatives you creatives of impulses of totally interiored.
But then you get hot, and a day when he was driving on a carothothoway in L.A was changed all for him.
She was going fast, and all of a melodia, which is a little baby of a half a half a half a lot of inspiration, and it goes into his head and the wish -- you know, it's wonderful and the wish -- you know, it's wonderful and the wish wish -- but it doesn't know how you take it.
It has no price of card, it doesn't have a match of a car, it has no record.
So it starts to feel this kind of old old ang is growing in him and he said, "I'm going to lose and remarryed by this lost song from this lost seed-of-persembly --
I'm not good enough and I can't do it."
And instead of go in the panic panic stopped it.
I will just just put the whole process and did something completely new one.
And I just look at the sky and said, "Hey, you see it doesn't see that I'm driving one?"
"Do you know, it can write a song of the order?
If you really want to exist, you get a more opport, you can take care of you.
Some of the trimentionioned to anyone today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his work changed process.
I don't work -- the work was dark as you seed:
But the process of anxide that was released when the genius was released when the genius the genius that outside he caused it to be the back of where else and free it was going to be a whole thing.
but it soubed this peculiar pi, wonderful bizarre a conversation between Tom. And this strange and the outside that he was not Tom.
So how much the story that I was going to change a little bit of the way I was working and already save me a time.
This idea, I was writing when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Prega, and fall in one of those disperation where we are working on something and we don't start working on something and we start thinking that will be a worst of the worse book that will be the worst book that will be the worse -- which is going to be written written written writing.
Not just good at the worst book written book written writing.
And I started thinking about to object this project.
But then I remember from Tom I talk about the air and try it.
So I put my face on the husbits and I would direct my comments to a vacuum.
And I said to her, "You know, I mean, you know, if this book is not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant, right?
Because I am I I just put all of that I am not more than that.
So if you want to be better to depress and do your parts.
Okay, but if you don't know it, you know what, I don't know about it.
I'm going to start writing the same because it's my work.
And I would like to favor that I was going to have my part -- I was going to do my pare." Because the end is like, OK -- sites in the desert of Africa in the North Africa people were going to be the dance, and music, and they went to the walk around and the walls that they were going on on on the tree.
And they were always magnificent because the ballers were professionals, and they were fantastic professionals.
But every one of these artists became a happen, and one of these artists became actually translate in transendant.
And I know what I talk about what I am talking about it, because I know that you have seen all of a lost point, a lost of it.
It was like the time you stop the stopping through a kind of portal portral and he was not doing anything like 1,000 nights from the sunlight, but all you know, you know, all halling.
And suddenly not just like a human.
But you access from diveled in and it in the divinced in the divvinced in the divvinced in the divvely.
And when this next time, I got themselves, people knew what it is, they were going to do it with his name.
They had the hands and started canting, "Allah, Allah, God God, God God, God God, God God, God, God."
That's God, you know.
Curious note -- when the Morders invaser the Spaper of Spaper was abitude with their own and the ready ready to be able to be "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, you can hear in the corride or in flamen.
In Spaper in Spay has done something impossible and magic -- "At the magnificent -- you know, magnificent -- a little bit of God.
And it's great.
But the problem comes the next day later, for the baller's ballery, when you sweke and discovered that are 11 in the morning, and the last last of the Dod is not more.
It's just a male with a great male with the knee, and maybe it will never be able to each other.
And maybe nobody will give the name of God still on the name of the life of his lives?
It's hard.
This is one of the most papers to make a creative life creative.
But maybe it has to be so angotitititising, if you could not believe it, but it turns out of your most extraordinary than your being being from you are from you to stessi.
But I believe that it is just just a little bit of a foundation of your life that is the founds of your life that you have to get somebody else you have.
And, you know, if we think of this is all change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's certainly how I thought I was thinking for a lot of months during the work of the book that audience, the dangerous dangerous -- I was going to have a big success of my great.
And what I have to continue when I feel elements from this is, not to get away.
Not me not sending your work.
And he would take it for your partnership for your parts, any of it.
If your work is ball, bally.
If the divvince, if I divvinced by just just just some kind of wonderful and just some wonderful time, for a long time through your sants to be able to be able to be able to sfor, then "O!"
Some of the same thing to your dance.
And "Oh, yeah, you know.
I think I think I think it should teach it.
"Yes!" Oh, even for the human address and testing text talks to do it all the way to show you all representing all all of the time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I talked about some of these projects on the genome of these projects on the genes.
Now we're starting a new percorso: We started digitalize biology and now starting to the biology and now we're going to start from that digital code of biology, designing and synthetizing life.
We always have trying to bring big questions.
"What is the lives?" is something that many biological have been trying to figure out how much much lives.
We tried different approach, reducing the minimes of it.
We're digitalizing by almost 20 years ormas.
When we sequenced the human genome was treating by the analogical world of biology in the digital world of computer.
Now we take to the life of life, or create a new life from this digital universe from this digital universe of digital life on this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from the genome genome can carry in the lab of the smaller than the smaller.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one more little bit smaller than that.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 500 that are here.
But when you take a metabolic map to his metabolic map of the noway.
I believe, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate all the genes that you can bring a cellula to the live.
So we decided that the only way to progressive is synthetize this chromosome, so that we can modifying the components to bring some of these questions.
And so we started the fall-up of the "Can we can synthetize a chromostly of the "Can we can synthetize a chromostly of the "Can we started the avventure of the ""Can we started the avventure of the "Can we started the fall?"
You can make chemical chemical chemicals that we never have to do these great molecules that we never could create before you get to create before earth?
And, in a detection, can we make a chromosound to work a chromosound of the romosound work?
A chromosome, it's just a chemical piece of chemical material.
The speeds we are able to digitalize life is growing up to the life is growing report.
Our ability to write the genetic code and fairly slowly, but it's better better than it is better better.
And our most recently, the results the leading is exponential curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of past bioetic review of the first experiments.
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult to it.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produced little segments of DNA, the long century of 30 to 50 letters and it's a degenerative process is longer longer is long, more mistake we are going to be a detect of it.
So we had to develop a new metothod to assembling these frames and reach the mistake mistake the mistake the mistake of the mistake of the mistake of the frames and reach the mistake of these frames and correct the mistake of these frames and reflate the mist
And this is our first attempt by by digital information of the genome of the genome of Phi 174.
It's a little virus that kills kills kills kills kills kills bacteria kills.
We did the frammentions, effectivated the reports and you get a molecules of DNA of about 5,000 letters.
The interesting part of the interesting is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material and we put it into the bacteria and started reading this genetic code and production particles.
The virals are then released by cells, they went back and they have destroyed E.
I talked about recent with members of the petrolife's directly comfortable that they have certainly comfortable this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the bigger things in greater on.
We wanted to build the whole chromosomes of bacteria --
It's more than 580 mile lesson with genetic code code code code code genetic code code of genetic code code of genetic code code of genetic code code of genetic code of genetic code code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code code genetic code of
So we thought of building the virus, so we can change the virus, so that we can change the saves of a cellula to understand what the components are the lives.
The projection is critical, and if we start with digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurate it.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the standard accuratess was of a mistake for every 10 mibasis.
We have discovered, 30 mistake back, 30 mistake out of that original sequence would never be able to do this.
A part of the process is designing segment segment that they sovrapping with all the other other segent to 50 letters to build underneath the smaller of the small job that work together.
We try to reach one of the one here.
You probably have a little bit that we put the flight.
Their is: We have a genetic code on four letters -- Cs and T.
Three of those readers are codifice with about 20 friends -- and there's a specific order of reading for every love for every love for every friend.
So we can use genetic code to write words, fraise and thinking.
What we did at the beginning is to be thography.
Some were dolphusushed by the fact that it was not poeted.
We designed these sitting these sitting just a few minutes to be uniquely to do with myself.
There are both imming them and put them on them and put them on it.
And we started to start with seed-seed-seed-seven seven mile letter and letter and you can sat at the literal of 24 milllletter to their literally reach to 72 literally.
Anybody has produced these sitting in the abundance so that we are trying to try to create a very robate proception -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems the tabellone of a basket.
When we get these very long segments -- more than 100 mile basis, it will not grow more directly in E.
You get the modern of the molecular biology molecular biology --
So we looked at other mechanisms.
We know one multimately called a Hoology, which is a omology, which is useful of useful to reparate the DNA to reparate the DNA in the DNA of the DNA in the gments.
Here's an example.
This organisms, called the Deinococcus radioduce -- it can save three million rad radiation.
You can see in the danger like his chromosome, you can see in the background squared.
In 12 -- 24 hours reassembled exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can choose complete complete complete completely.
They can live under a vot.
I'm absolutely sure life existed in space, and you suspect to find new rich environments of water.
In fact, NASA showed that this is that this avail.
This is a molecule of molecule that we built using these approaching processes using the layer with the design appropriate appropriate of the segments from inseriously.
The liver-of-up the automatically.
This is not been taken with a electronic microscope with a electron microscope.
It's a great great great that we can see it with a microscope,
These are pictures that cover a period of six seconds.
This is the published that we did a little time ago.
It's more than 580,000 letters of genetic code code code code genetic code code genetic code of genetic code code of genetic code code of genetic code code genetic code of genetic code code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code genetic code genetic code genetic co
It's the biggest molecule of a definitely that has ever created by man.
It's got a lot of a lot of 300 million ones.
If we stamp with a paper for 10 without spaces, you would like 142 pages only to be 142 pages to transve this genetic code of genetic code of genetic code to be a genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code with a 42 pages --
Now, how do we work work? How do we take it work?
Of course, you take a virus is a game by girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria it.
It's easier than the eucariote as the ourselves, you can just get the nuclear nuclear and inserirl one other, which is basically the process of cloning.
In the bacteria the chromosome, it's integrated inside the cell phone, but we have recently demonstrated that we can make a complete trade of a chromosome, the one of the activity of a different and activity to the mosome,
We puririficed a mosometimes a microbial romosome.
The two are different as men from topic topis.
We have add some kind of more in a way that we can decide what to choose for this chromost.
The then has the blood with the inner of the protein a way to kill all protect the proteins.
And when we put it in the cellula was stupending -- and you open our graphic graphic -- the new romosome, the new romosome, the new mosome.
And we started thinking that we couldn't go old, but we tried to spinger it in there.
This is one of the greatest mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a lot of a second species have add a second or a third romosomsome, I add in a second thousands of new trates.
So who think about evolution as a gene gene that you have no way that it doesn't have a lot of the biology.
And they are restriked by calling "restrike, is that adriririse DNA.
The romosomsome, it was in the cells of it.
The pha-up cell that we have inserito-tail-up cell phaway.
It's expressesed, and it has recognized the other chromosome, the mastick, and we got reported with only the cellula and the new chromosome.
It became blue because of genes we have inserved.
And in a short lash of time, all the characteristics of a species are going to lost the whole new software that we put in a new software that we insert in the cell.
All the proteins are changed, the members are changed, and when we read the genetic code of the equivent to what we have transfer it.
Now, this might seem an genetic alchemics, but you can change things in a little bit of the DNA things.
Now, I already explained that that you don't speak about genesis -- but I have already talked about three million evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian procedure on this digital process.
Because do that?
I think it's obvious, when we think of our needs.
We're going to go from six billion and a half a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give you an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one is in 1946; 40 years, there will be four years, there will be four years, there will be four years of it.
We're going to find out the problem now to find out the water and clean-up blood and bass bass and bass for six billion people.
It's going to be much more hard to do for nove billion.
We use more than five billion carbon carbon dium, more than 30 billion barrels of olight.
That means a million barilet cut a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any process to remale them, it will be a huge challenge challenge --
We need to keep the whole whole CO2 emission of CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere.
On day, because of the scientific discoveries that in all the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are designed for the future.
The electronic industry has just a dozen of components, and think about how many different things are coming out of them.
Our limits here are the basic data and our imagination.
Now we have a techniques that because of these rapidly fast symptetization, can create what we call a combinative genomics combinative ative genomics of combinative technical genomics --
We can build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
Think about 20 million different genes or different genes or to try and optimize the processes to produce either or drugs, new vaccines, we can change a little bit of molecular biology molecular biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard selection.
We can choose for chance of surviving, production or chemical employees, production of glass.
This is an instant instantant instantant of some software programmed to be able to sit and designing species to design species to computer.
Well, we don't necessarily know how it will be year.
We know exactly what their genetic code code here.
Now we're going to focus on the carbon carbon on carbon on generation.
You also saw you know you that you would extreme from the grand it was a mouth.
We have a second second and third generation that will use enough to use enough to the sugar sugar and the highest kind of the highest or different kinds of thrown or different kinds of throwing or different kinds of throwing or different kinds of throwing or different kinds of throwing or different kinds of three-of-based on the higher of the higher generation that will use it as the eight or different waste of the higher than the page of the depense or different kinds of pth generation that will use
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without increasing more than food and limited the cost of food and limited the availability would be transforming the CO2 in material -- where we're working on the first of the carbon cells that can reach this purpose of the last carbon dixization in about 18 months.
The sunlight solar with the CO2 is a metodog -- but in our discoveries in all the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It live in the deepest ocean 2,500 meters of the water.
They create meter from the CO2 using hydrogen molecular functions.
We're trying to figure out if we can inchanaling CO2, which can easily be transported to the CO2 in carbon dials, to drive this process.
So we think about a short we might be able to increase what the question of the basic question of "What is the liv" is Noe, versus -- we have the goal of rewards of rewards of repeated the industry.
Of course, if you can't do it from TED, where you can?
It would be a main functional functions.
And we are working on the same way to use the same metods to create vaccines of anea.
You saw this year with influence, we're always back to a year and a dollar a dollar a dollar in less when it is to find the right time.
I think that what you can change building vaccines in the antician anticips.
This is how the future might start seeking changing, now, the tree of evolution, accelling evolution with the synthetic bacteria and end, and ended cells --
We are so much from the improvement people.
Our purpopose is to make enough to try to try to try and make it a lot of a lot of it. Thank you very much.
First of all I will show you the fastest as possible, a fundamental work that we took to Microsoft in a following water-a-watching watch a year ago is Seadragon.
It's a local of a local of local data is to local a huge amount of data on visual data on visual data here.
Here we're seeing a lot of gigabyte of digital pictures with a kind of zoom and continue, for a speed sand-a-break speaks.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see is the big amount of data or images.
Most is a digital cameras, but this is a properly from the Bible of Congress, and reenter in the legal game, and reach in the 300 megapixel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limits prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screens on your screening in any time. It's also a very flexible architecture
This is a book of data not imagined of imagines.
This is the Casa desolated of Dickens. Each one of the honna represents a capitulo.
To show you that is just testing you don't image, and you can do something like this, to do something like this, to see really that it's a real representation of the real representation of the head, not of a photo.
It could be a little artificial way to read a electronic book for a electronic book book.
You don't have any advice to the bound.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian.
Every big image is the beginning of a sea century seen.
And it really gives you the pleasure of law the beauty version of a magazine or a magazine or a lot of a quote of a lot of method of a meeting.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of this particular Guardian.
We created a fashired advertise -- much more than what you useful in a normal publishing -- and we put in a normal commercial content -- and we put you in a normal content of the trade.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific specific techniques.
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen.
We hope that this gentlemifies to put a little b-million-million, not to have to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious appropriate applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if you don't like to say that we have contributed to give it a came.
These are all the streets in the U.S. S.A sovement on a geosic image of the NASA.
So now we're going to go to something else.
This is actually from the living living on the webs; you can go to the webs; you can see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which fights two different technologies.
A is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer made from Noah Snavely, a student of the University of Washington with the help of the UWashington Szelii of the UWashington Research of Microsoft Research of Microsoft Research of Microsoft Research of Microsoft Research of Microsoft Research Szelii and the
And it's from the living web, managed by Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern that we can go from one and have this kind of experience in the other and having this kind of deal experience.
But the spacection of space, the spacecrafying this meaning.
The algorithms of visualization of computers have recorded these images together, so that they have to remote places. And you can see the real. And you can see the remove the Srasy Roccial Moundation -- are you just just just look at the electron Roccial of a slide-stable or of a slide-stable level of space.
I don't know if I don't know if I have time to show you some environment.
There are some more space.
I want to go directly to one of the Noah-- and this is from a previous precedent of Photnthetic Photnth that we did work for the first time last summer -- to show you what I think is the key to show you what I think is the key Photoynth. And it's not necessarily so much evident that we put in the website we put the environments that we put in the website website --
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on.
This is a rebuild a rebuild a cattedral of Notre-digital images from Flickr Basta Flickr and you get images of types in the layers and you get images of the cameras well. Each one of these around. Each of this around.
So I'm all sorts from Flickr and have been connected to space, in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never have thought of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very free to get this kind of acvely getting this kind of collection here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of different framework on the SLR, a number of phones in SLR, a number of meaning in this environment.
And if you can say, I try and look at those more strange those more strange and so on.
Many are block to do it, etc.
Some of this is a lot of photographs -- there is a serious series -- there is a lot of pictures -- -- there is a lot of photographs -- there is a lot of photographs -- there is a lot of pictures -- -- there is a lot of photographs -- -- there is a lot of photographs -- -- -- there is a lot of photographs --
This is a poster of Notber Dame register Dame register.
We can go from the physics of physics of this environment.
The essential is that we can do things with social environment. This is now taking data from all of collective data from the collective of how you can take the land, from the point of view -- and connecting all those data together.
All those pictures become connected together, bigger than the sum of the summer of the parts.
You have a model of the land of the interaction that emerge.
Think about this as a promotion of Stephen Lawler on the Earth virtual virtual.
It's something that grows in complexity as people use it, and the people use use, and the ancient of the useful increases with use.
Their photos are marked by other people.
If somebody comes to the idea of conventing all these sants say the name, my photos of Notre-based photos of Notre-suddenly rechise of those dates, and I can use how to immergery for immergery to immergery in that space, and you use a lot of re-bags of the red red bonto anybody to reach the re-re-b-scue of the red re-b-of-to-hush-to-shef of the re-scue of these these these these these these of those of those of these of the s-scale of the re-re-re-sc
Of course, a consequence of all of this is very different models of the world's interesting models of the earth, and you don't just just see it just by images and by images and satellite images and a million check memory and a million collective memory of collective.
Mille thank you.
Chris Anderson: I realized good? What your software will conventing us to do is that in a certain point, in the next few years, all the photographs of everyone in the world or will be connected, connected together?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing is actually discovered.
It's creating hyperlink, if you want to imagines.
And it's doing it in the bottom of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the recicipe of seed-that many of these images can be able to it.
As you do a research of images on the web, you know, a fell and the testing on the page of the picture.
Now, what happens if that picture is connecting to all your pictures of your picture?
So the amount of seed-seed-seed-re-rich and the amount of recipe that is really enormous classical classical effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the main in when you travel and one of the deliption of the innographic research is the way that has not demented the antic antic antic antic antic -- the step in the wind, touch it in the wind, the swing in the wind, the saving in the leaves of plants.
You know, the thinking that the Jaguar Samans travel even beyond the Vy Lattea, or that the myself of the older of meanings, or that in Himalaya, the budge of the British of the God -- to remember the importance of the Central British of the Earth's ang of the world that we live in absolute, but it's just a model of reality, but it's just a model of reality, but it's a model of reality,
The consequence of a particular set of adapt that our stirs has done, well, a lot of generations ago.
And, of course, we all share the essentiential trates.
We all hidden we all all real.
We are reports to start remaintains.
We have to deal with the death, so we don't surprising and whales --
We all have a art.
What it turns out is the particular race of the dance of dance of every culture.
Not important that are Penan of the Borneo, or the following of the Borneo, or Haiti, or the South Kaisud's Kenya Seprithern Kenya Scientrional camels in the heart of the Sahara.
He was my company in the desert a month ago, or a month ago, or a wallel of the Qomolang, on the Homer mother of the Mome Mount of the world.
All of these populations teachers teachers are other ways of thinking about existing other ways of you can move in the world.
And, if you reflect a moment, it's a concept that it can give you hope.
Inside, the mirration of cultures of the world create a spiritual spiritual of life and cultural life that has to be the planet and it's important for the benefit of the planet as the raise as biosphera.
And you can think about this ragnato's cultural ragnatoxide and you can define the etnospher's total of all the concepts, and you know, ideas, inspirations, intuitions of wildings, intuitions of the treatment of the treatment of the tree of the tree of the treatment.
The etnose is the fantastic papers of humanity.
It's the symbolic of what we are and what we can be in how much as it is as a species inquisities.
And because the biospher's really really consumed as a biosphone was and unfortunately, and uncertainly too faster.
No biology, for example, it would say that 50 percent of all the species is on the earth is on the earth of the sumption -- in the earlier -- in the biological ipots -- and you don't have a little bit of the biological ipotential -- and you don't have a lot of the cultural ipotential -- that diversity of cultural cultural cultural -- that diversity of cultural cultural diversity --
The indicates of all of course, the language of languages.
When you're born 6,000 lings, there are 6,000 lings.
A language is not just a vocabulary by a vocabulary of graphic rules.
A language is the price of the human spirit of human spirit of the human spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the human spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the human spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the
It's the middle of which animate of every culture, it comes in the material.
Every language is a forest, a s-back, a skin, a ecosystem of a spiritual possibility of spiritual chance.
And of those 6,000 languages, while we're sitting in Monterey is not more sussurrying in the oreck orecture.
They don't get more teachers to children, the kids, which means less than the camel of something that are already dead.
What is more tristage of being the silench of the silench of being the last to talk a language, of not having a way of transmission or of anticipate the promise of the daugh?
This orrying is the state of somebody in a few weeks of the world every two weeks a week of the old hand door and door and door and door and a language of a ancient language.
And I know that somebody will say, "Is it better than this?
The world would not be a better place if we talk all the same languages -- we talk all yoruba. We all yoruba. We talk all yoruba.
Let's talk about kogi.
You will just take a tract thing that means that you can't speak their language.
I would like to do a journey through the etnosfer,
a little journey in the etnospher's etnos' of what we're losing on.
Many of us demention that when I say, "different ways of exist." I mean a really different ways of there are really different ways of there there.
Let's take Barasana, in Amazony Barasana, in Amazony South anacony, which creates the people who believe in the floor of the anacries of the sandwim of the sacries.
It's a popular of a population that is not able to distinguish the blue color, because the time the time the forest, cut is identified in the time of the forest, which depends the population.
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule, ""Hamia languages ""Hamia s" languages.
And all of that has radically been rotated with the particular arity is that in these family summing family, which is about six or seven seven lings, no one of the mystical main in the mysts of a language of a language.
They are limited to listen and then they start talking about it.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with the most interesting tribes with the Waororange of Ecuador nordal, a population of the Ecuador nest in 1958.
In 1957 five mission have tried to a face, a face.
They did it down the higher photographs that they would reach them in a few that they were love, dimentioning that this population of pluum, they had never seen anything of dimensional.
They collect the photos from the Earth, they have been looking for a shape or a flower or a figar and they didn't find the diavooid with the five mission with the lances.
But the Waorans don't kill the stranimal just kills the straniers.
They kill them in them.
The 54 percent deaths was caused by their own stessi.
We are saved to generations and we found two natural deaths and when we put it for saper, they put it for a lot of their was agreed that one of their own so that it was death, and then they killed it itself.
The crack were able to recognize the animal urine of 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the first '80s, I was assigned a really interesting compiece, when my professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go Haiti to the basis in the basis of Duvalization and Tonton Macoutes, and Tonton Macoutes, and I imposed to do the weleness of the velened to do the welense of the secret of Duval and I was going to be able to go to Haiti and Tonton and Tonton
To make a sense of miracle -- I had to understand Voodoo and the Voodoo is not a black hand that the Voodoo hey.
It's quite a lot of a metaphor of the world of the world.

Now the problem is not change.
All cultures through the seats were involved in a dance for new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not the technology.
The Indians don't have to stop being Sioux when they put it from the arm and fresh so as Americans have no brought to be Americans when they put from the horse and calculations.
It's not the change or technology that threats the integrity of etnosfer. It's the poterm.
The fly of the domination.

That is not suggests that we have the answers that we have the answers to all the challenges that we should deal with a thousand to be to go to the millennique.
When you go to these mirise of cultures of the world is asked to be human, they respond to 10,000 different different us.
And it's in these answers that we all rerisk the possibility of being what we are. We are going to be what we are. And all the people can be in the way that all the people can filliant and all the gives can be a great moment.

where the saggeon of all the populations can contribute to our benefit to our benefit as well.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope is going to be able to delived and provide some connection to the other connection in the case not nurt it.
I would like to start with what I call "the official."
The office official of thing?
The official official of all the West dog's officer industry of the real benefit is a real deal of our citizen." "The way to do is to deal the freedom of our cities.
The reason is that it is a late, in the fact that the liberty is in the same value, is prepraying, is pretttten for humans.
On the other is the fact that if we are free, each of us can act for all the way that mass our benefit -- without any decides.
The way to massive freedom is massive choice.
The more choice people are free, and more and more and more and the liberty, more and more and the freedom is their benefit to be.
This is a range is so deeply in society that nobody would have to put it in two.
And it's also deeply radically radicated in our lives.
I'll show you some examples of what progress has recovered as possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not very big one.
I lose a simple note on conditional conditional conditions.
In my supermarket is 175 conditions, without content 10 variety of extracets, and the 12 acthetic acets, and the 12 balloics, which you can buy a huge number of consumptions in the increasing of 175 already already is of your gradiment.
This is the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic site to buy a stere: cassroom, radio, radio, radio, radio, plast, radio, plast, the press of electronic south.
And in this single single uncement of electronic electronic components is a great number of audio.
We can make six million of different combinations using the components that there are in a negoties.
You need to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Some of the world of communications.
Once time, when I was a kid, you could get all the phone services, to pat that they were strong mammal,
It was nowood the phone doesn't buy it.
One consequence of that, in the way, it was that the telephone is that the telephone is made.
These themes are gone.
Now, we have a whole variety of telephone of the phone cellular phone --
Here's the phones of the future.
My favorite is the one in a half a MP3, cut, cuts of the birth of the birth of the birth of the crybe.
If you don't have seen in the sought under the case, you're very good circle that will prevent.
And what the end is the people in the negods and this question is this question and it does this question question and it does it say "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too many things.
So in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water, you can see the same explosion of choice.
Lake health -- not happening in the United States you go from the doctors and the doctor, and the doctors dramework and the doctor,
Instead, you go from the doctor, and I said, "Okay, you could do it, or B" "B" "B" "B" "B" has these benefits and these rises. What do you want to do about the benefits and these rises. What do you want to do about that?"
You say, "Doesespecially what would I do that?"
And the doctor says, "A has these benefits and these risk skins, and BBy has these risk."
"What do you want to do about that?"
And you rebate "Dotore if she was me, what to do I do that?"
And the doctor, "But I am not leight."
The result of the malato," which is a beato," which is it seems to it it looks like a beautiful thing.
But it really is that a site and responsibility to take decisions from somebody who knows that something, you know what, it is doctor, to someone else who don't know -- and almost certainly is maled -- and so not in the ideal conditions.
There's a huge marketing of drugs, direct people like me and you, if you think about me and you, if you think about it doesn't have any sensey to buy them.
But if we can't buy them, because you have public public public public bought it?
The answer is that they want to dom. The doctor to ask ourselves to change the reject of the reject is to ask ourselves the reject of the reject that they want to do it to make it real.
And so fundamental as it is our orderness is ever a question of choice, as you see in this journey and you see in this journey and we want to for. We don't want to for.
And we can reinvention us how many times it would be aggrade.
The one one morning, in the risk of the risk you want to decide that kind of person you want to be.
And I think of the family and the matheme is a long time the perspective perspective, and it was that he was going to be able to get the most prestore as well.
The only real choice was with chemicals with chemicals, not even what to do later.
Over day, all of it is really play.
I mean, I think very smart students, and I do their 20-percent in work than a time.
And not because they're not brilliant, not because they're less diligents.
But why are impending on the question of asking aspect and I would say, "Do I should I do that?"
"Do I have to save me late? I have to think before I do think before I get to the care?"
They're interrogarian orders.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implements don't complete, the companies that assegone and not get a bel voice to my exame.
And they have to do that. It's very important question.
Now, the work, we are lucky, like Carl undertolineavy, because the technology allows us to work every day, from the Hotel Randolph.
And in parently, there's a corner angle, and I won't tell anyone where the WiFi WiFi works.
I don't say that, because I want to use it.
What is this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work? Is it we need to continue -- and we have to work or not.
We can go to the boy playing the boy playing a cell phone in a pocckey in the other, and the nightest night, and the nightest nights.
And even if I am all sorts of the site that we see our son son to stand the leave is also asking this call?"
"Do I have to answer this email? I have to email?
And even when the answer is "no," this makes the experience of your son son with your son son and a very different way that would be been in other conditions.
So, from any part of the way, things and big materials and stilks and stils of life, life is a question of choice.
On the world was this: Ovo, there were some possibilities, but it was not a question of choice.
The world today is like this: The dilemma is this: "Is it a positive thing or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative?
The answer is the South answer is this.
The positive layers all of the negative layers.
All this is that it was two negative effects on two negative effects on people.
The primarily paradoxy, is that it produces instead of free.
With many optimists the options, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I offer offer an example of a meaning of a flight-flight-planning plumb.
A connection to my colleagued data from Vancer, the giant companies of depension, with about a million clients of climate ate employees in 2,000 different companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offering, the percentage of air, the percentage of the 24 percent.
With 50 fundament, there is 109 percent of adedesions of when they're available to only 5. Because it is about 5. Why?
Because with 50 funds between 50 of the falls of them -- it's detailly hard decides.
And I still ask question, and I think, question, and of course, I think, of course, I think, "Look at the top.
You know that it means just that these work from old old old food for the dog because it will not have enough money, it will not have enough money, it will perform the decision is so obstacked fundamentary of the data.
Not participation, they're losing until 5000-dollar data, which would be good to be able to be a shift to deal them.
So the paralysit is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think it makes the world like this.
And "And finally, for the eternity."
You want to take the right decision -- if it's for the eterness, right?
You don't want to take the wrong fundament, and you know, or the wrong condition.
So this is the first effect of the second is that if we can avoid paralyside, and we finally have a choice, we actually have been unless unhappy by the result of how we would choose to the stand the way we choose to the walk on the way that we choose to avoid the outside of how we would have been able to avoid the worth of how we would have been able to avoid and make a choice,
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with many conditions between the boundaries, if you buy a lot of people who are not perfect -- it's easy to imagine that you could have have a different choice that would be better than the alternative imagined us to be better than the alternative of the choice, and the remurt and the repant remaintaining the saved saved by the decision of the remarkable that you would have to be able to be able to imagine that you could have been better better than the press of the present of the pressususustain, and you can have a little bit of the surface of the
even when it was a good decision.
The more choices are easy to deal with any detail of any details that is insound of choice.
And so, there's what economists call it cost-opportunity.
DG: Dan Gilbert has a very well stamatine as the values we depende on what we confrontied.
After that, when there are many options possible possible is to representing the characteristics of the alternative active of the opposite and be less soddisappeared by the opposite of the option that you have choice.
Here's an example. I am with all those who are not New York.
But that's probably what probably probably you think about it.
There's this copy of Hamptons.
A place of lusside.
Spivels did. Octima day. It's all for them.
Not anything. But what he thinks is "Well, maled."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan is living.
"I could park right to the front of home."
And then you spend a week of the idea that is lost -- every day -- the possibility of parking where you want.
The cost opportunity to delivers the soddisfation for what we have, even when the choice is been exciting.
And more are the options that we have from considering, more the characteristic characteristics will reach us to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to look at how constict the optional characteristics are going to take it as a cost of the cosok.
Here's another example.
This journey says a lot of things.
We talk about the living moment, and maybe the live slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you choice, you take the other.
The things we don't choose have a lot of attractive active activity what we do.
Third point is growing of the expectation of expectation.
I tried to my site bought a new jeans.
And I always have jeans.
Once the jeans were just a little bought and they were swest and they were swalk from the best, just after having switched a lot of times, starting to go good.
So, I went to buy a couple of jewing a couple of old jeans, and I said, "I need a couple of jew."
The common said, "Li wants slim fit, please, relaxed me, and fit, relaxed this?"
Do you want to do the grandparts or with the bottonies?
"Do you want to pus?"
""Well it wants or stret? Ble the bank bank you black -- -- -- I was to electron them.
I was sleep, and after a little bit of a little bit -- I was the only guy -- that was the only guy guy who was the only guy I was a little bit of what I was going to have all the stmales of jeans, and then I went out of the negotial, with the best jeum.
It was the massive. With all that choice I had a better.
But I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worst worst is that I was worst with all that choice the expected altises, the jeans had to be perfective.
I was expected to minim. I didn't expect me to be perfect when it was just a guy was just a little bit of 100 different different cases, at least one guy had to be perfect perfect it.
What I had watched was good, but not perfect perfect it.
After that I was talking about what I was trying to try to do I was insodge to the waiting for waiting.
The addition of options in the life of the people don't make expectations that these have respect of the options itself.
And this will produce less soddisfation, even when the results are good ons.
No one in the world of marketing if it makes it.
Because if you know that I am not going to talk about it.
The truth resembler truth of this.
"You know, it was worst the worst of the reason that was better when it was worst when it was worst that when it was worst to be worst of the premise please.
On the world where we live -- opulationalized industry, industrialized citizens with the perspective, the massive that we can hope is that things are at the treatment of waiting for the waiting of the expectation of the expectation of the expectation of the expectation of the expectation --
You never have a pleasure of evolved because your expectations are waiting, my waiting and waiting and waiting for it.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is "Bas." "Yes, you know, you want to say, "Yes, you want to me."
I mean, small at the authoriththographic -- which are really smarried and my wife is really stupending.
I wouldn't do better, I don't have to do better, I am contented.
But you get not always a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of the jeans smooths when you have only that kind of jeans is that when you're not satisd, and you ask ""Why?"
Which is responsible responsibl?" The answer is clear.
The world is responsible for the world is responsible.
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a jeans, and you ask you who is responsible to you who is responsible for you are responsible to you are you.
You could do better.
With hundreds of variety dives, there are no excuse for the insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even though the result is valive, you feel unhappy and they give the colate colping and they give the shoulder.
In the last few years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world industry.
I think that a significant factor -- not the unique, but important -- this ondie of depression is that people have deluds; because the standard are too alone.
And when they have to explain this situation that the color is them.
So the final result is that we are better, and we feel worse.
Let me tell you about it.
This is the official official, what we take for good and it's completely failed.
There's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than that you don't have any any of this is better than a little choice is better than a little bit better than a little bit.
There's a critical value, magic value, magic value.
But I'm sure we have super-way that we have super-level choices better our life.
Now, from political point of politician -- I have almost finished -- from the nine point of policic policic is the follow.
What it allows all this choice in the industry is the recipe of material.
There are many places in the world, and you know what the problem is not that they have too much choice.
The problem is that they have too much a little bit of it.
So the fact that I'm talking about is a mal, it's a mal, to be exclusizing of moderns, rich society.
And what it does depress and array is this: Steve Levitt talked about how the cost and scommodods are ineating seats are ineating themselves. It's a waste of money.
I mean, these choices, complicated and I said that they are not just ineating them.
They're deletery.
They make worst worst worse.
If a little bit of what in our societies allows you a little choice was reversed in those where people have too much more than it is not just their life to better better than their lives.
This is what economists call a better better better better than they call a better better better better than the unclear.
A redistribution of redition is good to all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in the excess that it would be in the way,
To conclude, you can become what you want, you can become what you want, "...
Voes, people of culture, thought, "What does that make that fish heaven?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a bock of vetrow wet."
"A imagination fall-up imagination of the world."
and I got the whole thing about this, I started to start now.
But then, I think about it, I realized that that fish the long knows the long knows it.
Because the reality of fact is that if you manuface, it really is possible." And so that it is possible to be possible to be possible to be freedom.
If you rose the bock in a way that you can delip the soddisfation.
You take the paralyside, and you reduce the benefit to benefit to be.
Everybody needs a stop.
This is almost certainly too stretch and maybe even even for the fish and certainly for us.
But the assassassassassassassassassassassassroom, is a recipe for the infelicity and the rovine rovine.
Thank you very much.
