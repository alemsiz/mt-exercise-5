And last year, I showed these slide to show that the glacial glacial glacial -- that for for almost three million years had had the size of 48 million years of the United States on the size of 40 percent of the United States of the U.S.
And yet this substantial gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of ice because it doesn't show the ice of ice ice ice as ice as ice as ice as the fall.
The arty glacial artica is, in a certain sense, the climate system,
And you expands of inveries and you return out of the summer and writers.
The next slide will be a rapid of revenues on the last 25 years.
The icons are drawed in red red it.
And you see it expands up to the blue scene.
That's the ice in winter winter -- which is the summer of the summer --
You can see that the ice, the glacium glacium -- it's like the blood -- it's like sleech, which was coming out of the body.
In 25 years was passed from this --
This is a problem because the interested in the arty of the artic ground around the ocean in the arctic where there are huge quantities that are carbon that sheet, they come transformed in metan.
Respect to the totality of the atmospheric pollution, that amount could raddop, super-up of this doesn't come back to the outside of not back.
In some deep lake a little deep laghi is already bubbling on the water.
The professor, Katey Walter the University of Alaska has recated team was rected with a team of last last last last year.
Video: Wow! All right. The question is if we will be the question of it.
A reason is that this exchange in the Groenland surrises the Groenland from the north.
This is a glacial recornal regime
The brought had never reached levels like this.
This is the Kangerlussud-east Kangerland.
If you want to know how the ski level of the ice to the land on land on land here is where the sea land.
These corrups are increasing rapidly.
On the other side of the planet: Antarts, the largest block of the planet.
The month, the scientists have declared that the balance of ice is in negative, and that Antarctiddwestern in the island underwater in the submarine, is particularly rapid in the sheet.
And the quive, six feet level, like Groenland and in Groenland and in Groenland and in Groenland and in Groenland and in the water and the water and the water and the water in Groenlevel.
On Himalaya, the third block of ice ice block in the laghi, who were several new glacid.
The 40 percent of the world's population was recently half of the population of the population of the population of the population of the world requiable water in the population of the population of the population of the population of population was recently half of the world's population was recently half of the world's population of the world's population
One is the glacier of the water is the source of the city.
The took is increased.
But when you dimine, the same thing happens to be a touch of the drinkable water.
In California snow, the snow, the Nevada is decluitors of 40 percent.
The richines are in crisis.
The predictions, as you read it, are grave.
The growing of cities in the world to a remarkable increasing for incended.
The environmental disasters are increasing a returns out of the normal and without precedented precedented by the normal and without precedented precedented by the normal and without precedented by normal and without precedent.
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years of respect to the 75.
This is a sustainable crawling.
If you look at the historical context if you can see the consequence.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
And look at the oriental area of oriental Pacific Pacific America, and on both the continent, where there's a radical impoveriment of the oxygen in the oceans.
The major of global warming, together to deforestation, together to the deforestation, which is 20 percent, is the use of fossil.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries, with more emissions, together to China.
And he propose she was building a lot of other carbon and carbon and carbon
But we're assisting a change.
These are the annual projects in the last few years and some of the alternative proposes of alternative proposes of alternative proposes of alternative proposes of these are the last few years and some of the alternative proposes and some of the alternative proposes and some of the alternative propo
Anyway, there's a political lotly in our country.
The carbon and oil industry and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote charbon and that is a oxymore.
The image remind me remind me of something --
Natmal Natma, in Tennessee, where I live, there's been a 3.8 billion gers.
Maybe you saw that the news.
This is the second largest flow of scories in America.
It happened around Natmake.
The natalizes of one of the carbon industry was this thing.
Video: She's the carbon is a bah like a half and happy character.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economics.
Frosty carbon is increasingly cleaning crower.
It's pretty good for price, and the workers keep the styard.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The largest society on the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his friend.
Video: Don Blankhenship: I'm going to clear, Nancy Peloo, Nancy Peloo, Nancy Peloo,
Al Gore: So the Proteon the Clima Proteon the Clima has launched two campaign.
This is a being, a partnership.
Video: All right. At COALery see the climate changes as a service threats to our business.
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a public effort to make public and confused to make the charcoal.
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it's pulled -- it's also a good fumel.
So not predictateful of climate change.
Let me do you do that.
Video: All right. Clean -- you heard about a lot of talking about a lot of it.
So let's take a gyp in a structure at a frampe.
Straordinary cars are a little noisus, but this is the sound of the technology of charcoal charcoal --
The carbon is between the main the main scale of the global warming, but the remarkable technology of charcoal that you see changes everything.
You look at a glevel of the carbon technology of carbon digitem
Al Gore: Infinally, the positive alternative positive is to connect and economic issue and the national security.
Video: Here is is in crisi; the economy, economy, economy, climate crisis.
The filter that college everything -- our dependence on the fossil fuels, like sporh and the important.
Now, there's a new audance for using solution for the cirn't.
Repower America: 100-year-old energy in 10 years.
They plan to put America in work, to make us safer safer and helping us to stop the global warming.
And in the inally, one solution, a solution that you have to solve our problems.
Repower America. It's based more.
Al Gore: This is the ultimate one.
Video: Comment: It's about energy to America.
One of the fastest ways to bring up the dependences that kills kills that kills our planet.
And, the future is here. I mean, a new network, a new network.
She shot number: Noves investments for places of well.
Man: Repower America. It's time to be realist.
Al Gore: A old African old African proverbs says, "If you want to go fast, go fast, go fast, you go fast, go fast, you go fast, go fast, you go fast, go fast, you know, you go fast, you go fast, go fast,
If you want to go away, you go away, you together."
We have to go away, quickly.
Thank you very much.
And last year, I was a delivered introduction on LHC.
And I promises to come back to how the machine.
So here I got it. And for those of the other time there was no her, LHC is the largest scientific experiment scientific experiment -- 27 miles of miles of surround surrounded -- 27 miles of circumstomor.
His comfortable to reach the conditions that were less than a billion of a second of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
And all of this is just environment.
This is the underneath Gineven.
We photographs Big Bang Bang Big Bang in the relaers.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's a 44 feet and has a 22 feet and has a diameter diameter of 22 feet --
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can see proportion in proportions.
And 10 sets last year, we have access, we access,
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immenses festonies in the control.
It's a picture of the first particle of particle that had done all the gy's board of the LHC, entering into collision, deliberately spread particles inside the LHC, and spread particles inside the relief of the LHC, and spread particles.
In other words, when we saw that imagined the 10 set, we understand the machine works, which is a great life.
I don't know if it was that to do us more or opposed to do that, when someone went to Google and saw that the beginning was this thing.
That means that we had a cultural impact of beyond that scientific impact.
About a week, it was a problem with the machine, had to these files here -- these files.
These files bring 13,000 print when the machine, it works to the massive of power.
Now, technicians between you look at files and say, "It's not real. They're not true. I'm filters and say, "It's not true.
And they can do it because when they're very cold, they become the superconductor files.
So, at less 271 degrees, a further instore in the space between the stars, these filters can bring that corrup.
In one of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a defection of factory defection of factory.
So the filters were surprising themselves to read themselves a suddenly met of a resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impression, if you think that these magnets are about 30 centimeters and that were moved about 30 centimeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to you, what we did that.
We have them repristined and add it.
They're now now now they're going to come back to the ground.
Enthrown the end of LHC will be again,
We accenate it and we expect of the data or jugly or slights, and continuing so our windows are the matts that are the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain fairly -- these accidents reaccepting the debate of science and engineering frontiers. It's easy to confuture. It's easy to confuture.
I think that it's so difficult that it's so difficult to go beyond the limit of things like LHC.
I want to end with the words of a scientist, Humphrey Davy, which is a defense of inuseful inuseful experiments of his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, and he said, "No he's a lot of humans as much as a dangerous, and it is so dangerous, which is so dangerous, which is not us, and we have been able to be completely and our triggered in nature, and our triggers,
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about this in here, from children, playing the bricks.
While you realize them and reach them and reaching them and realize, and learn them move, learn about and resolve problems and resolve problems and manipulating relationships.
The space reason is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us.
So, from information inspired by using by using our interaction with physics, with my consultent Pacacti, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi, I started asking myself, "And if we use a computer, instead of having the only one of the mouse of the mouse as a gital degital with a napsor of our leading room with entrames and physically a handle of information with both of our own own own own own own own hands
and how to do it in our please?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided we would exploring the answer, building the Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a great interactive computers as a biscope.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a great interactive computers as a biscope.
You can move them with the hand they can see it "The motion," they can see their movement and a wireless screen and a wireless.
But more physics, as physics, as physics, as the mother, you can just move on the broad.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information.
And as they become more physics than the physics, and as they are more physics, and as they become more physics, and as they become more physics, and the other totally as we can explore new and exploring new and fun and fun and tun style tell.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This is a Siftable to show video -- if you including vides: if you inct it in a direction, the video will go back to the other side back.
These interactive rhyths are of the others.
If you are in the case what's they are interested in what they are around it.
If they are surrounded surrounded and they can agitate a little bit.
If they are surrounded surrounded and they can agitate a little bit.
They also have their movement and incline.
And we realized that one of the interesting of the interaction was the power to use gestures on data, for example, "verside are" as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated secks and I can use them to do for the color in the central colors in the central where they mix mix of the color.
and I can use them to use them to the color in the centry, where they mix mix.
If we do it too much of it, we can put a little bit about place.
And it's also beautiful possibilities of learning, like the mathematics and games of logical logical and logical gical results.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacus, and Fibonacus.
Here we have a game play that is half between Schabeo and Boggle.
And in the case, in every turn and I got a letter in every Siftable, Pratically, at every turn Siftable, and I get a letter in every turn Siftable, and while you try to deal with a dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds remissing, and you have a new set of reading and new possibilities and new possibilities to try and come possibilities to try and stick a new set of reading.
Thank you.
Here's a little kids came to the Media Lab, I did it so that they tried them and I swalked a video.
They are pleased.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of education
You just said, "Looks, the words, and they know exactly what to do.
Here's some people who try it.
This is our younger bete, there is the right.
It was actually wanted to be larger them.
They were just a mother, for him.
Now, this is a application of a interactive cards.
We wanted to build a tool appreprecise of the Lui is Felix.
It can put new characters in the scene, and relief the Siftable their associated associated with them.
It can put new characters in the scene, and relief the Siftable their associated associated with them.
And it's doing the sun.
Video: The only is the sun.
David Merrill: He's brought a treat in the scene.
Video: The treatment of it.
By work!
So school Siftable and put them together can be able to make people characters --
Video: Bau!
and inventing their story.
Video: Cia!
DM: It's a story with an open-open-up story with his instance.
DM: It's a story with an open-open-up story with his instance.
Video: Video: Video:
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, realized recently, to try and execk and exective music.
it's a tool, realized recently, to be sample, and to execk music.
The Siftable here are playing from sound like based and batteria.
Every one of those has four different variations, and you can choose what use.
You can get these sound sound of these sound to your please.
And it just making it just making a sound and a "sound and a "sequence."
These are effects, you can control from living, like reverber, and the filter.
And then it takes it up to a particular sound and then including it wrong.
And then there are the general effects as time and volume, which are apply in the sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to start put a base in two Siftable sequence, we will get the extend to be a series, extend to be add more base.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: DM: I'm going to add percent.
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control effect from live.
Video: I can quick the entire sequence inclining the entire sequence in a side or from one side or on the side or on the other.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the filter to the basic to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombinate the sequence "at the volume.
So I don't have to planning it before, but I can improvise, make it more longer or more corty.
And now, finally, I can get the entire sequence inclining the entire sequence inclining the Siftable "volumme."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new interfaces in the middle of machine and more more like our brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of the results of this percord, and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to transmit you is that it's coming this new generation of objects to interact with digital media that will bring information in our world in our world so that we want to do.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk with all of you.
They're a write writeric.
And I wrote books is my professional extension, but it's more than that, of course,
It's also love and the fasthck of my life.
And I don't expect that it could change it.
But I said, something particular happened to be recently success in my life and career, who brought me to recovered the entire rely recalibring the entire rely recently with this work.
And the particular thing is that I recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, in my previous -- -- my previous books, for some reason -- and he became a big sensational.
And the result is that everywhere from now, people are treatment me as if I was convicted me --
By -- convicted, convicted, convict!
They come to me and do everyone is now worried and they say, "Don't you fear no longer to do better?
Don't you afraid to write all of life without any longer being able to create a book that can be able to somebody who can matter somebody who can important.
that can be able to someone?"
It's remainsure you know.
But it could go worse, part of that I remember over 20 years ago, when I was about people -- I was an adolescent -- I was an adolescent -- I wanted to be a write scale --
I was going to meet the same reaction of the country.
And people said, "Don't do you get to succeed?
Don't you fear the hot of killion kills you know?
Don't you fear that you do this mestier for all of life without out any swalking on a heart of saving dress with a baby of dress with the mouth of falt crowing up falks?"
Which you know.
The answer -- the brief answer to all of these questions is, "S."
I fear of all those things.
I had the fear.
And I also fear of many other things that people would not have to be inated.
As a and other things -- and other frightening.
But as I was writing about this and I would write and I wonderful is why why is?
Is it ration?
It's logical that anyone who needs to be scared by a work that I feel that I heard to do that.
But what is so particularly in the impresequence creative to make us live to the mental health of the mental health for other career cannot do it?
How my father for example, he was a chemist and not rememistry and not remembering for a money in his 40 years of activity where he was asked to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer than being able to engineer chose?
It never had -- that was that the engineer of John, how do you know?
It didn't work, so that it was that it doesn't work like that, right?
Enestly, chemical engineers don't have certainly in the century, in the century of being alcocohyacre-lized maniacs of maniacs --
We have enough of the reputation, and not only writers but creative writers but creative of every general, we have this reputation of being enormously unstable to of mind unstable.
And it's not really, the sad of the deaths of the magnificent deaths of creative minds that, only in the 21st century, they die and often for hand often hand often for hand.
And the ones that don't have suicidata seems to be really disappeared by their womans.
Norman Mailer, before he dies, in the last interview said, "Ogns my book was killed me a little more." Our extraordinary recording about their life.
But we don't bat the time when we heard about why we heard these things so we heard these things that we were completely interior and accepted the notion of creativity and accepted the notion and the art are kind of read and the art of the angods.
And the question I want to ask everyone is that I want to ask with this idea?
You go well this thing -- because it looks from a centimeter of distance to me not good for anything this suppose is not good for anything about this supposed supposed to do anything about this suppose --
I think it's hodious.
And I think it's also dangerous, and I don't want to see perpetuated.
I think it's better encourage our great minds creative minds to live.
And I know that in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- would be very dangerous, to begin to that feel dark up to that feel the circumstances where I am in my charrie.
And it's very young -- it's quite young -- are quite young and I have about 40 years.
I still have about four work in me.
And it's very likely to write that any time will write in the world as it will be right from the world as the work that was going to be right after I often,
I'm going to be unsquirts, because we're all more or friends here -- it's likely to be that my biggest success is to my shoulders.
Oh, Gesus, that you think of it!
You know this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to start drinking nine morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to do this work that I love to do this work that I lot.
So, the question becomes from, what?
And so I was a lot of reflective reflections that the way to do to continue to write is to create a psychological construction of protective, ok?
I have to find a distance of security between me, that I'm writing to me, and my natural anxiety anxiety that was written E, as I was trying to find out out the last year scores on how to do it through time, trying to find out more societies to see if they could have some other societies and healthier ideas and healthy and sane sane and sane and and sane --
how to help people creative people to manage emotion.
And that research research and Roma.
And then you get back to some circle and then back back back and then back back back back in the circle and then back back back in the circle and then back back back in the circle and then back back back back back in the circle and then back back back in the circle and then back back back back in the circle and then back back in the circle and then back back in the circle and then back back to the skin and then back back back back back and then back back back and then it comes back in the circle and then back back back back back back to the soul.
In the ancient Greea and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity came from man, OK?
And it was thinking about creativity was this about divine and that came to humans and come to a few surface and unknown for a few distant distant distant and unknown as well.
The grees called the Reeans were looking dians of creativity of creativity "demony."
Socrates, wonderful, he believed to have a demion that elargive wisdom from away from away.
The Romans were in the same idea, but they called the kind of spirit without a genius.
And that's great, because the Romans didn't think that a genius, they didn't think that a genius.
They believed that a genius, this kind of divine entity that was living in the walls of an artist, a little bit like Dobby, and that came out of the narrow of the narrow of the artist's work, and to modeling the around, and modeling the result of that work.
Excital -- there is the distance of which is the psychological psychological that has protected you from your work.
And everyone knew that was so that he was so that it worked, right?
So the anti-such artists were protected by certain things, like for example, right?
If your work was exception was that you could not get all the market, everyone know, everyone who was helped by this encourage that was helped by this encourage.
If your work fail, it was not all your own failue, right?
And everybody knew that was your genius to be a unable to be a unable to be a unable able to be a unable able to be a unable able to be a unable to be a unable to be a unable to be a unable to be a unable to be a unable to be a unable to be a unable to be a unable to be a unable to be a unable to be a unable of unable to be a unable to be a unable to be a unable to be a unable to be a unable to be a unable
And so people have an conceived the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then the Rinascise came and everything changed and was this great idea; we put the human being; we put the human beings and mysteries and without let me space and without leaving creatures write of the divinity.
This was the first of the rational humanity and people started to think that creativity and people started to think that creativity came completely from id.
And for the first time in history, you start to referring or that or art like a fairly that was a fairly that one person with genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think that allow someone simple person to believe being like a recipe as a founds, the essence and the sisters of all divines, creative and inknown all the mysteries and etherments is a filter or too big to be a film to be a film for the fragile human phragile golden --
It's like to ask someone of engineer the sun.
Deform and destores the effort and creates all these ingestilive expectations on the performance.
And I think it was this pressure to destroyed artists in the pasts in the past.
And, if that's true, and I think that the question becomes in, and now?
Can we do it different?
Maybe I think it's more ancient understanding of humans and mystery creative relationship between humans and mystery and mystery of humans and mystery to a more ancient understanding of humans and mystery of humans and mystery of humans and mystery creative to be more than the relationship between humans and mystery of humans and make creative understands.
or if it was n't.
Maybe we can't crash 500 years of race, a rational thinking, in a 18 minutes.
And there is probably people in the audience that would be relatively to the scientific suspects, you know, you know, you follow people who following success of their projects.
And I will probably not convince you all about this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why is I want to ask is -- why why
Why don't you think it in this way?
Because it has more sense than any other thing that I've ever heard to explain exxiety exaspertor of creative process of creative process of the creative process of the process of creative process of creative process.
A process of that, as anyone who I've ever tried to do something -- so basically -- yeah.
And, in fact, it can sometimes it seems completely paranormal seems completely paranormal.
I did this meeting with the extraordinary Ruth Stone, who has now 90 years, but it was 90 years, but it was a poeter for everything in life, and he said that during his childhood in the Virginia, working out in the field, and I felt it was going to be in the wind of the landscape.
He said it was like a rather treneum trenough of the air tracks.
And he came rolling up to her landscape.
He heard it goes, because he had to try and draw the earth under his feet.
He knew to have one thing to do that and it was saying to the point and he said, "run how a morn."
And so he was going to home and it was followed by this poetry and it would not have to do more than take a piece of paper and a pretty much fastic paper and and deal with it and deal with the page.
And he couldn't be quick enough to be quickly, so corrective and rounded up and round it out, and the poetry rolled through and poetry her rolling through and she would continue to roll through the landscape, and he would continue through the landscape, "another poeta."
And then there were those times -- this piece of the time I don't forget the moments in which was almost lost, OK?
So, he was running at home and was looking for the car, and he was looking for the poetry through and she'd go through the right as he was going to go away, and then he said, he was like a woodwell, and the effort off.
And he had the poem from the coda and the coda and he had his body and translated it on the page.
And in these cases, the poetry would be presented on the perfect and intact page and intact on the last word on the first time.
So when you heard about -- it's crazy exactly the same creative process of my creative process of creative process of my creative process.
I don't all my creative process -- I'm not a conductough convicty.
I'm a mule, and my work to work is -- and I can see me at the same horary every day and southern on and southern us and go over and go over and go on on and go over and go over and spend on the sould.
But even ium, in my wild head, I took against that thing, sometimes a time.
And I imagine many of you have a lot of you do it.
You know, even if the work and ideas I would come up with a certain sources I could not be honestly know.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to the same way that we don't do our head, broad, rather than to stay ourselves sanies?
And for me about it, the best example of the contemporary that I have is Tom Waits, which I interviewed different years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the major of life was the incarnation of contemporary artist in contemporary ary, trying to control, gestished these kind of emporary creative interior.
But then he was told him, and a day day and a day while he was driving on a highway to Los Angeles, he changed all for him.
He was going to fast and all of a tract track of this little frage of melodia, which comes in his head as inspiration, elusive and althetic and these, you know, it's wonderful and wish and wish and wish wish -- but it doesn't know how to take it.
It doesn't have a piece of paper, it doesn't have a matter, it has not a recorator.
So it starts to feel this kind of old anxiety anxiety to grow up in the type, and I will remarrying out of this song as well.
I'm not quite good enough and I can't do this cheap."
And instead of going to go to the panic stop.
And he put the whole mental process and he did something completely new thing.
And he just looked at the sky and said, "Scuse, don't you see what I'm driving it?"
"You seem to write a song hour?
If you really want to exist, it goes back in a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
Or adments, you go to important.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process worked changed after this.
Not the work, the work was still dark as you can seed.
But the process of the fishing anxy that was released when the genius, the genius, the genius, which was going to come from, and remaining it where the came from, where he was a whole thing that had to be an interiornal and realizing that was not a whole thing and I got back to the mind.
but well, this is a great conversation between Tom and a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that was not Tom and external thing that was not Tom.
So I felt that I was going to change a little bit of a little bit of how I was working and saved me a volk.
And this idea, he saved when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Ama," and the droom, and drop in one of those disperation where we are working on something and start thinking about what is going to be a disaster, that that will be a disaster, that that that will be the worst written written writted.
Not only bad written just book, written --
And I started thinking about throw this project.
But then I remembered Tom who talked to the air and try to us.
So I would get my face on the lack and I would say my comments to a corner in a vacuum.
And I said high you, "You're both now, both the book is not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant, right?
Because as you see I'm putting all of what I haven't not more about that.
So if you want it to be better and you have to press you and make your party.
Okay. But if you don't know what I don't know about it, I don't know anything.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to flew that I today that I have today presented me to do my park -- -- the end is like this, and it's like this, and it's like this, and it is the North people dancing for the moon's dances and music sacred and music sacred and music sacred and music sacred and hours to the high and hours to the high and hours to the high and the hour, and hours of the hour,
And they were always magnific because the ballery were professional and they were fantastic.
But every one of them -- rarely happened, and one of these artists became to actually transendent --
And I know what I know about what's talking about, because I know that you have all the one one performance like that.
It was as if you stopping and the dancing walking through a kind of landscape and was not doing anything different from usual and it was not doing anything in different from the solite; it's all about the slights.
And suddenly not as a human being.
But you access to the degree and under light in the divinity of divinity.
And when this was happening -- the time, the people who knew what was was called her named him with his name.
They were the hands and started to singing, "Ah, Dah.Allah Doe, God."
That's God, you know.
And he had name historics -- when the Mororor's southern the southern Spay was a purpose-changed century changed in the century of "Allah, Allah, Allah," which is yet in the hole, which you can still feel in the corride or in the corride or in the float.
In Spana, when an artist made something impossible and magic "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, be, burther," incomprehensible, and so on.
And it's great because we need it.
But, the problem goes on the ballery of the ballery of the ballery of Martedday morning and discovering God is not morning, and the last last decade of God is not more.
It's just a dead death, with the knes to the knes to be going to be able to ascut that altea.
And maybe no one channels of God even as well, and what it has to do with the rest of his life?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to do in a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so anguy if you can not believe it doesn't believe, in fact, that the most expects of your being coming from you to yourself.
But believed that you give you a data from a intive squisite from a inimaginable.
And, you know, if we think about this whole whole whole change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought about it for different months in the working of the book that public book that I public book -- and I further, the dangerous, dangerous,
And what I have to continue when I feel electried to do when I feel electric feel like that isn't fear.
Don't further. It's just your work.
It inues you present to present, whatever it could be there.
If your work is ball, ball, dance.
If the divine, you know, you would get some kind of crawing some kind of wonderful deliver, for a moment through your efforts through your efforts through your efforts -- "Ole!"
Or you get the same tubes of your dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself.
I think I think it out.
"Ole!" to yourself, even for human love and test love and test talks to to you to do you continue on the way.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've talked about some of these projects on human genome genome of these projects on genes.
We're starting a new percorre: we started digitalizing biology and now to start from that code and now from that code of digital code and synthesizing and synthesizing life.
We always tried to take a big questions.
"What is the life?" is something that many biological biologists I think of a levels.
We tried different approaches, reducing it to minimum minimum --
We're digitalizing from nearm for 20 years hor.
When we sequenced the human genome of the analogical genome in the digital world.
We ask us, we can regenerate life, or create new life from this digital universe from this digital universe in digital universe --
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from the smallest genome in the smallest genome in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create a smaller one more smaller.
We're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the 500 people who are here.
But when we look at her map on his map of metabolic, it's relatively easily respect to the name.
And I redemed -- this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimine, one to the time, it's very unlikely that this can bring a live.
So we decided that the only way to progress was to synthesize this chromosomes so that we could actually modify the components to ask some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the winning of "Poan we synthesize a crumother?"
Can chemistry of provide provide these big molecules that we never could create before?
And, in case of business working, we can make a chromosom ther?
A chromosome, is just a piece of chemical material inert material.
The speed with which we are able to digitalizing life is growing up to exponential.
Our capacity to write the code genetic code genetic code -- it's better deliver, but it's improving.
And our most results results the results are exponential treatment.
We started 15 years ago.
And the process has requires a lot of passages, starting with a bioetic reviewing reviews.
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult to be very difficult hard to be very difficult.
There are decades of thousands of machines in the world that produce small segments of DNA, the longer than 30 to 50 to the set, the most errors are longer than the side is longer than they are have.
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and rors.
And this was our first attempt to particularly from the digital information of Phi X 174.
It's a little viruses that kills kills batteries.
We designed the fragments, effectured the course, the reition of the DNA molecule, and got a molecule.
And the interesting part of this is when we took this piece of inert material and we put it in the bacteria started reading this genetic code and producing this genetic code of viralals.
The virals are then released by cells, they came back and they come back and back back and they destroyed the E.
I talked about recently with recently members of the oil industry saying, they certainly understood this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build his same hardware in a biological system in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things more large.
We wanted to build the entire chromosome.
They're more than 580 miles les of genetic code code of genetic code of genetic code.
So we thought we built it in the size of virus, so that we could change cassets to change what the cassets are in a living cell.
The design design is crucial information is crucial information in a computer, these are must be very accurate to be very accurate it.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the accuratezing was a mistake of mibasis.
We found out of it, recently 30 errors. If we had used that original sequence we would never be able to do it work.
A part of the process is to design, is to designer segments that are overwhelming with all other segments of 50 letters to build under-building subunites to build underlying little little working together.
We try to roject elements here.
You probably read that we read about the boat.
Think about it -- we think we have a based genetic code genetic code genetic code and T.
Three of those letters are codifying about 20 lominoacidis, and there's a specific order to reading every love.
So we can use a genetic code to write words, and thinking, and thinking.
What we did in the beginning was auton-hot care.
Some of people were deluses from the fact that it was not poetry.
We designed these segments for simply them to actually just with a person.
There are people in the imum and put them and put them and put them together.
And we started set to assembling the particular segment from five to seven milles, until a segment of a lot of letter to them to 24 miles to the letter to them to 72 miles of letter to get to 72 millly.
And we product these segments in fact that we have these segments in fact that we're trying to create a remarkable procept that we're trying to create a summer -- how you see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems to be the table, it seems a basic plays.
When we get these very longments, most of 100 miles, more than 100 miles -- they will not growing more directly in E.
It comes to the limited instruments of the molecular biology.
So we considered other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called omologists called homologists in biology to repursue DNA in the grade of the DNA in the degrade of the segments.
Here is an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiodurans, it can suck -- three million rad rad of radiation.
You can see in the high school require as his chromosomes came up with destroyed.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can be able to get completely right.
They can live under empty empty.
I'm absolutely certain that life exists in space, and you move to find new environments of water.
In fact, NASA showed that this happened to this started.
This is a picture of the molecules that we built using these process, just using the board, using the design appropriate appropriate for the design appropriate segments to inserious seats.
The lievisit of the automatically.
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope of rule.
It's a molecules that we can see it with a microscope of read.
These are photograph that they cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago.
They're more than 58,000 letting genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code genetic code of genetic code genetic code of genetic.
It's the largest molecules that we have ever created by man.
It has a molecular molecular on 300 million of them --
If we were going to spend a 10 cararacter, we would want to 142 pages to get this genetic code of this genetic code this genetic code of them.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we active,
Of course, you can track is a girls.
It's a little more complicated when you use batteries.
It's also simple when it's a cell as well as our re: you can just extract the nucleus and insert a nucleus another one of the clonation.
In the bacterium archaean is integrated inside the cells, but we recently recently showed that we are able to do a complete transplant trapier from one cell crumbling out of one cell and active it.
We purifted a chromosome, from a micromosome.
The two are different than the topies.
We added some genes in a little bit of a way that chromosom to choose for this chromosom
And he took up with the people in a way to kill all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cells was wonderful -- and you appreciate our character, the new chromosomes was gone in the cell.
And we started we thought we couldn't go beyond that, but we tried to be done in the time.
This is one of the most exchanisms of evolution.
We found that many species have added a second or a second or a third of a few hundreds of new thousands of new tracks in a second thousand new tracts of a second or a third of a second or a third of a second or a third of a second or a third of a second or a third of a second or a third or a secon
So who think about evolution as a gene of a gene gene that modic has not understood part of the biology.
There are people called the restriction of restriction is that they degerist DNA.
The chromosome, which was in cell.
The cellphone; the cromosomes we put it up,
And it's expressed and has recognized the other chromosome, and it has masticked it with only the cells and we found with only cells and the new crum.
it became blue because of the genes we put in it.
And in a briefly lass of a half ago of a species are gone in a new species, and it turned out to a new species, the new software that we put in the cell.
All the proteins are changed, the membranes are changed, and when we read the genetic code genetic code of exactly what we have transferited.
Now, this could be genetic, but altering genetics, but altering the software DNA we can change things in a pretty stick.
Now, I've already explained that you don't talk about genesis -- but by three million years from three million years of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process of digital process of this digital process of digital process of this digital process of the digital process of the genesis that we have to cre
Why do I do that?
I think it's enough when we think about our our needs when we think about our needs
We're going to spend six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
And just to give an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each of 1946; in 40 years, there are going to be four years, they will be four year,
We're going to find out food, fresh food, fresh, fresh water and dropped doctor, and a half billion people.
It will be more harder for nine billion --
We can get more than five billion carbon carbon and more than 30 billion barrel.
And that means a million barrels to a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to replace them, it will be a huge challenge of a huge challenge for replace to be a huge challenge of a huge challenge for replace to be a huge challenge of a challenge biological processes to replace that will be a huge challenge of a huge challenge of a huge chally.
And in the most of the CO2 emission of CO2 emission, in the atmosphere.
And the today, thank you for scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are designed for the future.
The electronics can only have a dozen of components, and think about how many different things came out.
Our limited here are data principles from reality and our imagination.
We now have techniques, thanks these methods of synthesization, in able to create what we call combinatories.
We're able to build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
Think about process these 20 million different genes or or trying to optimize the processes to get the process to produce either or drugs, or vaccines, we can change a little team, and create biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard self set of standard.
We can choose for possibilities of survive, providence or chemistry or carbon and carbon and chemistry of vaccines --
This is an instantly some software programmed to be able to seat, and designing species and designing species to computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they will be not.
We know exactly what their genetic code.
Now we're focusing on the focusing of focusing of focusing
You saw you that you can extract ethanol from the grand was an experiment of the bad.
We have a second floors of second and third generation that will come pretty soon as well-holder than the higher value as the either of futans.
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without more to increase the cost of food and limited the food of food and limited availability would be transform for the cells that we're working for cells that we can reach this discovery, and we think we could reach this discovered in about 18 months.
The solar light to combined with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries around the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep ocean deep about 200 feets of the water perature of the water bubblizing water.
It rees build up with CO2 using molecular energy source of energy.
We're trying to figure if we can put CO2, that can easily be transported by maybe making the CO2 in charburons, to drive this process.
So the short we think we could be able to increase what the basic question of the basic is Nomimilar -- we have the modest opeal to repiring the oil industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do it?
It would become a main source of energy.
And also, we're working for using the same way to create vaccines to create vaccinists.
You saw this year with the influence, we're always back, and we are always back to a year and a dollar in less when it's treatment.
I think that that it could change building vaccinable vaccinable in anticip.
And that's how the future could start seem to change it, now, the evolution, accelerating the evolution, accelerating with synthetic batteries, and infinally involved cells.
We're so much more to be so much more people.
Our purpose is to live enough to try and do it for a lot of long-to try to do it. Thank you very much.
I will do you see the most quickly possible, the most fundamental job, a new technology that we took Microsoft in the Microsoft in a water agree in a year ago, it's exactly.
It's a environment where you can interact is a local level, which remote with a huge amount of visual data visual data --
Here we see a lot of gabytells of photographs with a kind of digital zoom and continue, to be a panoramic, aving the images as we want to do the images as we want it.
And it doesn't matter, as the amount of information that we see, how big these data pieces of data or images.
Most are communicates -- but this for example, it's a scansion, but this for example, it's a provision of the Congresss, and reenter in the game.
It doesn't do any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of place in your screen in any moment. It's also an architecture very flexible architecture very flexible architecture and so it's a very flexible architecture of a system like this is the number of place because the only place of
This is a book inter, example, of data not images.
This is the Sun-desolated Dickens. Every colonna represents a capitol.
And to show you that it's just about head and not images, we can do something like that, to see what is a real representation of the representation of the text of the text of the text of the text of the text of the text of the text of the text and not images, we can do something like that, to see a real representation of the real represent
It could be a little bit of an artificial book a little electronic book.
You don't consider.
This is a more realistic. It's a number of the Guardian.
Every image is the beginning of a century of the center.
And it gives you the pleasure and the beauty experience of read version of a view or a quotidian of a view or a quotidian of a half half a lot of meeting.
We also did something with the angle of this number of Guardian.
We created a high-resolution, high-resolution, much higher than what you use in a normal publish.
If you want to see the characteristics of this cartoon -- you can see here.
or even other models, or even techniques and techniques.
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen on the screen.
We hope that this means to put pop-up and other pop-up and other porkeries are not going to be necessarily necessarily to be necessarily to be necessary.
Of course, the maping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have contributes to give it in this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. It repounds of NASA.
So now we go to something else.
This is actually actually from the webs; you can see it in the webs; you can see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which combines two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research, very interesting to Noah Snavely, a student of Washington, with the aid of Washington, with the aid of Steve Seitz of Microsoft Resear. Seliski Resch. Seliski Resch. Seech.
And it's from Seadragon the web, gestrush by Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen where we can go from one image of the other and have this kind of experience in the other and have this experience to multiply resolution to the other multiply resolution to be in a multiply of the screen that kind of experience in which is the kind of experience of multiply and have this kind of experience to be in the kind of experience to the other and have this kind of experience to be in the kind of experience to the other kind of multimatelt of experience to the multimately,
But the space collection of the images here has actually an meaning.
The visualization of visualization of the computers have recorded these images together, so that the real short of the real shot -- all close to the Grass -- all close to the Grash -- have been taken on the MontagRoccious chanaist -- you know, you know, you can see elements of a slides of imagined panor, and these things are all the space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environmental environment.
There are some more space than it is some much more space space than it is.
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noahotosynth -- and this is from a previous Photosynth that we did work for the first time -- to show you what I think is really the key -- to show you what I think is really the key of Photosynth. And it's not necessarily really evident in the environmental environments that we put in the website.
We had to worry about legal aspects and saw often saying.
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images made by Flickr. Basta digitate in Flickr. Basta digital of the types in the machines in the machine, and so on. And so on the field of the represents a picture that is discovered an image that is discovered to this model.
So they're all pictures from Flickr and have been connected to space this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never think about to end up to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratify to get this kind of nice to get this kind of nice here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of fotos of fotos -- from the those photos to those phototos in the environmental photos in this environmental environmental framework in this environmental frames of in this environmental photos of different photos of the photos of sane photos of different phones in the photos of different photos of different photos of different kinds of fun of different phonessions.
And if you can try to do those strange strange.
Many are blocked by does, etc.
And somewhere here is a series of photographs and -- there is a series of photographs and --
This is a Notre poster Dame recorted.
We can go from the poster physics of this environmental physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do with the environmental environment. This is now taking from the entire performances of how the Earth, the view of view -- and it college everyone in those data together.
All of those photographs become together, more than the sum of the slights.
You have a model of the land that emerge.
Think about this as a promodiation of Stephen Lawler work on Earth
It's something that grows in complexity as as people using it uses to the people us, and the vantages for the people who are using with the us.
Their photographs are marcked with other people.
If somebody is the idea of contrast all these sanitors of Notre Dame suddenly Dame suddenly Dame suddenly recchief to all those data, and I can use the point of engineer in the space, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, using the space, in that universe, using the type of a smooth.
Of course, a consequence of all of that are virtual models of every interesting in the Earth of the Earth and satellitaries and images -- but from the memory of the collective and images -- but from the memory of collective virtual and similar to collective virtual models of all interesting in the plane of the Earth, of course, and the memory of the Earth of course, and a hatell-plane models and and and and simils, but
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood OK? What your software will confy us to do is that for a certain point, the next years, all the photographs and shared up everybody in the world will be practically colleged together?
BA: Yeah. What is doing is basically discovered.
He's making hylink, if you want to hyperlink between images.
And it's doing it in the bottom of the images.
And it becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth information of the seed information that many of these images.
And as you do a research of images on the web, you detect a sentence and the head on the web page, is about the pictures of the photos.
Now, what happens if that picture is connected to all your photo?
So the amount of interconnection, and the amount of reality and the amount of recycle that is really huge effect. It's a classical effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible. Compliments.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the main of the main of the pleasures and one of the ethnic research is the power to live between who has no anti-traditions, between the wind of the plants in the wind, touches in the wind of the plants.
Basti to think that slips Jaguar is traveling still beyond the Vily Miky Waya, or that the gents are still meaningful significantly myths are still himalaya, to remember, to remember, to rememberal the importance of the anthropologies that we live not exists in sense, but it's just a model of reality, but it's just a reality, but it's just a reality,
the consequence of a particular choices that our stirps on the stirps has done in the bad, many generations ago.
And, of course, we all share of essential tratental trates.
We all all the time. We all procreid.
We're subjected to be beginning action.
We have to deal with the inesorability of death, so we don't surprised us and ballim --
all of us have an art.
What it is the running of the song, the rhythm of each culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Geans of the Borneo, or the follows of Haiti, or the Haiti, or the Kais: the Curan Senya sectonal in Kenya santhor's heart of the Sahara.
He was my journey in the desert of journey in the desert of yak in the vallator in the valley in the valley in the world.
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking about it, other ways to think about other ways of thinking about other ways of moving in the world.
And, if you reflect a second, it's a concept that can give you hope.
And so the cultures of cultures of the world create a ragnailing of spiritual and cultural life and cultural planet and is important for the bend of the planet so as a biological ragnatezy nice as biological raises --
And you can think about this rather cultural ragnailing as an ethnose and you can call the ethnos: the total amount of all the conceptions, ideas, inspirations, ideas, intuitions from being from the human imagination of the consciousness.
The ethnic ethnos: The patrimonum of humanity.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in as an inquisite inthitive species.
And because the biosphere was freshly consumed highlighted by ethnose is happened to ethnose and purposely more quickly.
No biology, for example, would say 50 percent of all species was or on the horle of the extinction of the extinction -- in the most pocalitics -- in the most pocalitics -- in the field of biological diversity -- and you don't have near the most optimistic diversity -- that of cultural diversity -- that of the cultural diversity -- that is about the most optimistic diversity -- that is about the extinction of the species of all species -- that are not going to be on the hy
The indedication of that is, of course, the language.
When you were borns 6,000 languages on this planet.
One language is not just by a vocabolary or from a series of rules gram rules.
One language is the human spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit spirit of spirit language.
It's the mean with which is the middle of every culture comes in material.
Every language is a forest of mind, a by-indepensive -- a thinking, a spiritual system.
And of those 6,000 langues, as we are here in Monterey, at least half the half of the children.
They don't come more teacher teacher children, which means you don't change something, which are already to be dead.
What is the sad of being folks of being volved by the silence, to be the last one language of the language of avails or or amount of the children or anthesis the promiss?
And this is the state of somewhere in a few weeks of the world every two weeks of a year, one of the silly ancient and door and door and door in the tomb.
And I know that somebody will tell "I’m not better?
And the world would not be a better place if we all talk about the same language?" Benish simple, then we talk yoruba. We talk about the source.
We talk to a kogi.
You're going to be able to talk about your language.
And I would like to do you do a journey through equipment --
a little journey of the ethnos: you know, a little journey of what we're losing.
Many of us forget that when I say "different ways of exists of existing existers" inting a lot of existers.
We take for example, this bimbe, in Amazonia, in the setty of the anaconda, which creates to come from the river, which creates to the milk of the river, and it was going to be from the river,
It's a popular that is not able to distinguishing the blue color, because the time chelests is identified in the forest, where the people are identified in the forest, where the popular popular popular popular popular color.
They have a strange language and a mathematrimonial rule, "English languago's language -- you have to married a different language.
And all of this has been in the mythological past, all the particularity is that in these family extensive six or seven language in which is a seven language because of the mysts no practice language.
They listening to listening and then they start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived with which I lived -- the Waorananananorananth, a popular population that had had the first contact in 1958.
In 1957 misionary mission, they tried a committed contact of a fact that
They made up from the photographs that were writing them in a few people who were retendled friends, dementioning that this population had never seen anything about the population had never seen anything about biggest in the size of the plug of the plug of the plug of the photographs that were going to be loved with some of the plug of the forest forest forest forest,
They gave the ground, the photographs from the Earth, they turn to a form or a figure out what was the diavole, they have conclude that was the diavole, and they killed the diavole, and they killed the broken with the lands.
But the Waorans didn't kill the strangers.
They kill each other.
And five percent of mortality was caused by their own own own own own own own own own ones.
We're risalitites at eight generations and we found two of natural and when we insisted for knowledge of them was insisted that one of them was instead of that was dead, and then they kill it him.
The hunters were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the early '80s, I was assigned a very interesting comfortable when my professor of Harvard professor in Haitites asked me if I wanted to go to intrupholars in the power of Duvarier and TontMacoutes, and TontMacoutes, and murch.
to give a miraculous, I would have to understand Vodough culture Vodoun culture and the Voodoo is black nera.
It's a quite of a complex vision of the world.
Very interesting.
If you ask the great religions, what would you say?
Cristianesim, Buddhym, Buddhhistory.
A continent is always left out, thinking that sub-Saharan Africa, and the Voodoo doo religious -- and the Voodoo doo is not that the distilled of these religious conceptions of the deep of the slavery of the slavery of the slavery of the slavery of the slaverism.
What makes your interesting is is the intense of life, and dead,
So the vive of the spirits.
And the spirits can be invocked by the Great the run of the dance and they replace to the dance of dancing and they replace to the animate in the soulder, which is the dio.
And for this voodoodooists love to talk about God.
We daming in the temple, and we become God."
And since you are having a spirit that you drive you, how can you do mal?
So you see these incredible events of these incredible events of trance events that touching points inning a rather demonstration of the power of the mind when it's catalyzed in the body of the mind when it's catalyzed in the state of mind when it's catalyzed in the same extreme of the way of the brain in of the trance events.
And I was all the people that I lived on the most extraordinary Kogi is the Kogi Sierra de Sierra de Santa Marta, in Colombia.
And the ancient of the ancient civilization that once they live on the floor of Colombia in attention of the conquist, the population of the population that was going on on the floor.
In a blood continent blood continent, this popular has never been conquered by the spagnol.
And yet today, they're governed by a classroom, but their formation is decided.
The young people are taken from family to three or four years, and they live in a world of good and they live in a world made good and shadow in the glaciers for 18 years.
Two nine years choices of proposes to reproduce the nine months that were in the utery of the gestation of the mother, are metaphorically, in the utery of Great the user of Great Mad.
And for that time, they come acculate to values of their society, values that predict their preachum and their preicor, and only their prejob balance -- or to say the balance balance.
And in terms of this incredible initiation, they are suddenly carried out and for the first time in life in their own life, at the age of 18 years, they see a albe. And in that active of the first wrony -- the sun-bathy of the beautiful beautiful of the beautiful beautiful in his spendory is conference. And he say:
"Right? Propril I said,
It's just wondering. It's going to protect it."
They called the major brothers and say that we him, brothers are the purposes of the world.
This level of intuition, is extremely important.
When we think about Indian populations and the environment of invok and the old environmental history of the wild history of the nice that is a rapid in his simplicity or maybe Thoreasier and say that these populations are closer to the Earth of us.
The indigenes are not feeling until until unloced by our algies.
There is no space for these things in the malaries of the Asmat or wind gelides of Tibet, but because of the time and the riters, they created a mystic, but on a mystic, in a well-beings -- but on a well-being: the concept that the Earth can live because it's infusing on the Earth can live because it's infusing from the consciousness of human consciousness of the human consciousness of human consciousness of the Earth in the Earth and delivery much suburtleast
What does it mean it?
And that means that a Ande of the Ande grows that grows that the mountain is a spirit of Apu that will be a destiny of its destiny and will have a very different rate of respect and will have a lot of function of the mountain or that grows a mountain a Montana girl of the mountain is scavailed a bunch of rocket.
which is a spirit of a spirit or a minal was irrileving.
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the metaphor, the natural world's reporting and natural world.
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannica creating that the forests service.
And he realized me a human being being different from my friends Kwakiut, who believe that the forests are the Hukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukukuku's beautiful in the world, spiritual lectures that are deal with the initiation.
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality and you can start some sensations, you can start some sensations. We take this plant.
I took this picture took in the normal Amazonia.
Maybe some of you have heard about ayahuas, the most powerful psychoactive repertor of the slight-slight-slight-slightly psychoactive of the repertool of the slight-hyayath.
What makes the fascinating the ayahuass is not the potential of character, but his elaboration. It's compound two elements. It's compounds.
On one side, this liana ladies that connects a series of beta-carbine, harmine and harm, slightly hallucinot --
And I take the only plant is a bluepractice that alters a little bit of the conscience, but it's myself with the floats of a hundred of the family of the coffee of the family of the coffee of the hundred viridis.
This plants of triptamine, very similar to the servotonina, dimetho-five halklydimethoxoydimethoxoydimeet.
If you ever see Yanomami Yanomami that are the nose that they do from a different species, and species, which is a different species, and it has mean mean oxoydimethoxydimeymmeythoxyltry."
Tray that policy is a little bit like being disappeared by a smoke dipins and land on a barokay and land on a sea of electricity.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who shot the scatedelic, with his psychedelic, with his discovery of hallucinot in the '30s.
I think my testhesis you can classifigure out how hallucinogens because if you're not doing anybody to be able to tell anybody about being hallucinated.
It's possible to such a horally if you assumption with other chemices that monitions that monites are the MAO.
It's now the beauti: the beta-carbon that are in this board books are inhibitors of MAO, the same kind of need to potentiate triampty to potentiate trigger trigger -- in a flow of 80,000 plants, as these popules to find two morphologistically not in this way-to-cy-to-chemical version, but if you fight in this way?
We use the great euphemism of proof of of the proof of of the proof of of the proof of of the proof of of the proof of of the proof of of the proof of of of the proof of of the proof of of the proof of of the proof of of the proof of of the proof of of of the proof of of the proof of of the proof of of the proof of of of of the proof of the proof of of the proof of of the proof of the proof of of the proof of the proof the provide and error, which is and error,
But if we ask Indians, they will tell us "The plants to talk about year."
What does it mean it?
This tribe, Cofan, 17 variety of ayaxum and the gartly in the forest, and that our eyes would come in the same forest, and that would come in the same species.
If you ask the way they were able to tell us how they will tell us "I thought I was thinking about plants, the rest of the rest doesn't know everybody?" I said, "No."
The solution is, you take 17 variety in a night and a place and everyone night and each other.
With you don't have Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to count the stams.
Now, the problem is that the people that are also the people who have to care of the people who are the heart of the indigens are burgs but somehow reduced to the margin our real world -- and spends to our real world, and spends to our real world -- and spends that are a little bit of a reality, and spends that are a little bit of a respect of the world --
In fact, the 20th century, in 300 years, it will not be remember for his innovation or its technological innovation or innovations -- but rather like the destruction of the innovation of the biological diversity and we took the destruction of the biological diversity and the destruction of the planet.
All cultures through the century were involved involved in a dance for new possibility of life.
And the problem is not technology.
The Sioux doesn't stopped to be Sioux when they put out of part and freckets so frecket, as Americans have been horordered in the hororcal and calm.
It's not the change or the technology that are until integrity of ethnos. It's the power.
The flight of domination.
And if you give you a look at the world, you discovered that these are not cultures to disappear.
They're living creatures and dynamics out of the existence of identifiable forces that go beyond their capacity capacity of adaptation.
And that was unbodies of disbodies in the Golden pendent --
a popular night in Sarawak, in southern southern southern lie in the forest forest in the forest forest to a generation ago, and now reduced to service and the prostitution, where you can see the rivers of the rivers of the book-up in the light of the Borneo Borneo Cinese Merdionian Meridionty of Borneo towardions --
prones the stick of the basis with the underly.
Or in Yanomami, are the diseases that are coming with the pursues that are coming with the purpose.
If we mountains of Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research of research of political domination.
As you know the genocide of a population, extinction of a population, but the ethness, the ethness of lifestyle of lifestyle of lifestyle of lifestyle of lifestyle in certain environments, because it does part of the developing of developing developing in a environment.
And you can't understand the suffering of Tibet until you start in the beginning.
I have a lot of Chinese Chinese China in Western China through Tibeautiful Tibet in Lhasa with a young college, but only came to Lhasa I realized in Lhasa I realized the statistics that we heard about about about.
6,000 world's sacred world's reduced in policy.
1.2 million people killed from military Revolution.
The father of this young was ascritual to Panchen Lama.
And that means that was killed to the Chinese times of invasion.
He's coming out of Santity is in Santity in Sua Santity in Nepal.
His mother was imprisoned and his colpe was rice.
It was brought to carry in the age of two years old, and it was born, because he could not live her gonna because it could not live without of him.
The sister did the same, which was put in the field of reeducation.
A day was really totally hot a raffuring a raffuring raffesion, was put in the major for seven years.
The Tibet of Tibet can be unuseful, but the spirit of the population is from keeper to keep present.
And it down, everything is reduced and a choice.
We want to live in the world, or we want to live in the world's world's world, or we want to get the policy?
The great anthropologist, before he died her before he died her that his largest lamorous -- in our view of the world, we don't just see the whole gamm of human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination of thinking about thinking about it, but a day we see on a sleep.
And it's humiliating to remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolitical Rvolution that agriculture, which has done us to the cult of the seeds -- and replace the poetry of the slide of the clerard's poetry with the proskin of the specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrialized world has 300 years.
And that was not suggests suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we will face in the thousand year.
When these myriad cultures of the world is asked what it means to be humans, respond to 10,000 different voices of different cultures.
And it's in these answers that we all risk we will be what we are see: a consciousness of being what we are. And there are large a consciousness and all the gards, and all the gards, and there are large moments.
I took this picture on the northern extremity of Baffine, when I went to the balene hunters with Inuit, and this man, Olaya, he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather.
The government canadese was not always gentled with the Inuit and in the '50s, to stabilide our sound -- we have them rhinks.
The grandfather of this manufactured to go on us.
And the family -- I was a life, he took all the arms, and all of his tools.
You have to know that Inuit doesn't have the freedow, the freedom to be the freezed,
The slands were made of fisled fiskin fish, and they were made in skin the skin charge.
The grandfather of this man, you don't do mean by the night or the artic night or from the board that had suffering.
It's a baked skin and he was hot the skin skin and defect on the focusing in their hand. When I did you have conguring a lam.
He has salived on the top of this caccepting and when it became solid, it has killed a dog.
It has a slands and created a bribe, and created a sland and he was slaughed a sland and and it's disappeared on the banks, and it's disappeared on banks, and it's compared on the banks,
We want to talk about caving it with non-Risate." And that, in different ways, and in different ways, [Applent] is the symbol of the popular popular popular indigenous popular indigenous genes of the world.
In the 1999, the canadeded to get the Inuit to Inuit the total control of an Eritory of a land-a-a-up of California and Texas together.
It's their new path. It's called Nunavut. It's called Nunavut.
It's a territory of independent on minerary territorically.
One beautiful example of how a nation-state country that was a nationally reconceived with his population.
And, finally, I think it's pretty obvious at least at least to the people who have been in these areas, remote that they don't remote.
For someone is home.
And for us to represent the human imagination that are rising to the high of the hope. And for us all the samples of our children, are part of our children, become part of the hope.
And finally, we were convinced to be convince that politicians will never get anything.
We believe the polemy --
[Applease. They don't persuasive -- but we think stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best institution, and maybe our own institutions of our own own own history of the world. Every website of views.
156 countries transmate our television channels in the fact that
Our reviews are literally reading from millions of people.
Our work is traveling in ethnic ethnic in place of the wonderful cultural wonderful cultural and multicultural amount of how they saw hope, they will hope for the center's hope of anthropologistlfriends to be in a pluralist of life in a pluralist and multicultural world, and multicultural world's going to be a pluralist and multical world's going to be
in which the wisdom of all the populations can contribute to our collective well-being a collective well.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope I hope to be called other than you heard and try to get some connected, in case of the case not know.
I want to start with what I call "the official dog.
The official dog, what?
The dogma dog, the official societies of Western industrial societies "If we want to massimizing the well-being of our citizen." The way to do it is to male freedom, "The way to be to male freedom."
The reason is from a side of one side, in fact that freedom is in the same a value, is precious, essential for humans.
On the other is in fact that if we are free, each of us can act to do everything that is about our well-being, without any one that decide in name our well-being, without any one that decide in name of our well.
The way to massive liberty is to male freedom is to simizing choice.
More people choices people have the libere, and the bigger is their freedom, and the freedom is their well.
And this is so deeply, it's so deeply in society that nobody would be dreamed to put it in the twout.
And it's also deeply radicated in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly large.
I allow a simple named on the conditions.
In my supermarket are 175 conditions, without containing 10 vets of oily oils of oil's oh and 12 byfriends that you can buy for you a huge number of of minds in the slide of instance, in the circumstances that no one of the degree of your degraded.
And that's the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronics to buy a stere: CD, B, and CD, please, the CD, pleasures.
And in this single snow, in this single snow, there's a large number of components.
We can do six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in a negotid.
You have to admit that there's a lot of choice.
Other camp: the world of communications.
One time, when I was a child, you could get all the phone telephone is desired, you could get all the phone that were mamma Bell.
And he read the phone -- you didn't buy it out.
And one consequence of that, in the other one was that the phone don't stop out.
These days are gone.
Now we have a variety of phone is almost illitated by phone cells.
Here's the future.
My favorite is the middle, and MP3, cutting them in the nose and form in the nase, and form in the crash myself bule."
If you don't have seen in the negotiate negotiats under the house of the house of the house of it will be pretty certain that you're going to be going to be able to pretty much as a house in the house negotid.
And what the end happens is that people come in the snows and does this question and ask the answer? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cellphone; it's not too much and things.
So in other aspects of life that are much more important than the waters, you trues the same explosion of choice.
Assistance is: not happens in the United States that you go from doctor and the doctor and the doctor what you have to do.
Instead, you go from doctor, and the doctor says, "Okay, we could do A, or B" "As you can do these benefits and these risk." What do you want to do?"
You say, "Dr, what should I do?"
And the doctor says, "As these risks, and these risks, and Bs these risks."
"What do you want to do?"
And you rebated, "Dr. If she was me, what do you would do?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not here."
And the result we call it "the autonomy of the malato," expression that it seems to be a beautiful thing.
But it isn't that one to move the fish, and the responsibility to take decisions from somebody who knows anybody else knows nothing about -- and so it's not -- and so in the ideal condition, and so in the ideal condition, to take decide to take decide to make the patient.
There is a huge marketing products, if you think about drugs, direct to people like me and you, that if you think about you've got no sense, that we can buy them.
But if we can't buy them, why do you public them for it?
The answer is that they want dom, we call the doctor.
And so fundamental is how our identity is a choice, is a question of choice, as you see in this job." We don't want to force the children. They're going to be able to get a hydrift-hydle of the right -- we need to invent a hyd: we need to inve.
And we can reinvention us as well.
which means that every morning, you have to decide that every morning, you have to decide that kind of person wants to be.
And the respect to the family and matrimonium, a common perspective -- was that you could get the pretty soon as you could as the pretty much as possible, and she started the pretty much as possible.
The only choice was choice was with choice, not here, and not what do later, and what do later.
Today, everything is really to play.
I teach students very smart students and I do 20 percent of work than a time.
And because they're not brilliant, because they're not less diligent.
but why are they impensiers, I mean I said, "I should be married or or no? I should do it now?"
"I should be married later? I have to think about before the kids or care?"
They're interrogatives of logorant interrogatives
And they try to answer these questions, even if this imply not completely to the compites and not get a well-up to my exam.
And they really have to do that. They're important questions about it.
Now, the work: we're lucky, as Carl sub-tail, because technology allows us to work every single day from every single of the planet, tranne angle of the planet, trans that from Hotel Randolph.
Twentess, there's a angle, and there's a angle. And I don't tell any what, where the WiFi Fi works.
I don't tell you that, because I want to use me.
What does this mean this incredible liberty liberty that we have to work on the work? Is that we have to decide, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our broad ball, with the cell phone in a tas, the Blackberry in the other, and the needs -- typically on the knee.
And even if they're all screwing, every minute that we see our children to fire the head, we are also asking this called "I have to answer this called a?"
"I have to get this email? I have to email?
And even when the answer is "us," all this makes the experience of your child very different than what would been in other conditions.
So, in any part of the look at it, little things and large objects and big materials and stilular objects and stiles of life, life is a question of choice.
Of the world was this: Obver, there were some possibilities, but it was not a choice.
The world today, the world today, which is "I’m a positive thing, or not negative or negative to be or negative or negative now.
The answer is the degree is the dealth.
The basic side of the negative basis of the negative set.
And all this choice of two negative effects, two negative effects.
The first one, heavy is that it makes paralysis instead of reliberation.
And so many options of the options of the choose, it becomes very difficult to do it.
And I'm offer an example of mean -- a study conducted study on the plans of pension.
A colleagues had access to the Vanazing of the Vanazing fundamental sources of pension, with about a million clients in 2,000 companies.
What she found was that for every 10 solutions that are offered in every 10 solutions that are offered more and descenes than 2cent.
With 50 sources there's 10 percent of less ades of adesions of when they were available only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources that choose, is malezed, and the choice, and the choice, and choices is remained to question.
And the question and questions, questions, questions, questions, and of course, questions don't get there.
You know that not just mean that these workers from the old workers for cans because they don't have enough money for cans because they don't have enough money to say that the decision is so ostick the foundary of work.
They don't participatch, they're losing to 5000, and they are losing it from the dator of work, which would be well dispoints to them.
So the paralysis of having too many choice.
And I think it will make the world like this.
"And finally, for the ethernity: "How do you get a cheape or or majion?"
You would just take the right decision is that if it's for the ethese, right?
You don't want to choose the bad source, and neps the wrong condition
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and do a choice, we are less than the result of how we would be states with less options that choose.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions, which is that you can imagine that you could have a choice, it's easy to imagine you could do a different choice. And what happens is better than it would be better than it would be be better than the alternative imagined in the choice, and the type of choice, and the sodden place --
even when it was a great decision.
More choices are easy to be a dispieeasy of any details that is insodden of choice.
And also, there's what economists are called cooopportunities.
Dan Gilbert askarises a very well stamning of how the value of things that we do with the things that we confrontive on it.
And the stay of that, when there are many options of the characteristics of the alternative characternative and be less satisfacts of the option that you choice.
Here's an example. I just use with all the ones that are not New York.
But it's what you probably thought.
There's this couply to Hamptons.
A place of luxio.
It walks beautiful there. On the day. It's all about them.
Nothing that was not eat. But what he thinks is, "Well, malesce, is Augosto."
"Everybody neighbors in Manhattan are alik."
"I could talk about front just in front of home."
And it turns two weeks assilled by the idea that is losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where he wants to get where he wants to them.
The expensive opportunity decreases for what we have, even when the choice was excellent.
And the most of the options we have to consider themselves against the more characteristics will be returns out how expensive expensive to be the constantly returns out to be the constants that we have to consider the more expensive characteristics that are going to be returns out how the expensive characteristics that we have to consider the cost of the expensive characteristics of the expensive of the things that are going to be the
Here's another example.
This views a lot of things.
And it turns out that moment, and maybe live slowly.
But the most important point is that any of you choice, you choices you choice.
The things that we don't choosing the facactive that can make less attenthures what we do.
And third point: growing spiral growing expectations.
I tried on my skin coming a new jeans.
I was almost jeans.
Once jeans were just a type, buy them and dreamed them and dreams were shem, only after they bestia, they were only brought them a lot of times, they started going to go well.
So, I went to buy a new couple of a new when the old people were go, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cuteans, this is my cute."
The committed told me "You want slim fittered them up?"
And he wants with the cernight or bottons or the bottons or "Stoneburst?
"Like you want to road you to do you want to row them up?"
"Obbasis or strettty? Bla bla -- and it was elenses to elense --
I was wish I was going to say, "I want the only cheans, and after I said, "I want the only guy -- that was the only typoth," so I tried to all the myself all the diseases of jeans, and then I was going to go out of the negotio, with the best jeans that I had gone with the best jeans that I had go.
It was the male of the choice. I had had the best.
But I felt worst I felt like that.
Why? I wrote a book about it.
The reason I was worse for which I was with all that choices were altissue, the jeans had to be perfectly in the jeans had to be perfect.
And I had expectations of mine. I didn't expected anything about existed when it was only a type, but when you live 100 different in the country of them in the midle of them should be perfect.
What I had watched was good -- but not perfect.
After I was a choicked with what I was trying to get insure I was insumed in confrontation to expectancy.
The add of options in the life of people don't have to increase expectations that these are respected.
And this will be less satisfaction, even when the results are good good.
No one in marketing the world of marketing it happens.
Because if you know that I know that I would not know what I'm talking about.
The truth of the truth of this.
"You were better when it was wors." The reason was wors." The reason he was going to be when you were worse.
And today, in the world where we live -- opulent, industry alized citizens with the expectancy -- the male that we can hope is that things are to healthize.
You never surprised because you have your expectancy to expectancy, my waiting and expectancy.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is "Basse wait."
I want to say -- little at the time, authobiographic moment -- that I am actually married and it's really wonder.
I would not have to do better, I don't have content.
But you don't always get a bad thing.
And finally, a couple of of the jeans of jeans when there's only that jeans is that when you don't know whether you're satisfacts, and you say, "Why?"
"Who is responsible.
The world is the responsible. What could I do about that?
When you have hundreds of jeans, and you buy a jeans, and you ask you who is responsible responsible to the responsible is the responsible that you are you.
You could do better.
With hundreds of varieties available, there are not for the insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even though the result is valike, you feel insodden and dying, and they give the chole.
In the last few years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think a significant factor -- not the unique, but the important -- of this depression is that people experiences are very much of deludings because standard experiences are too high.
And when they explain this situation think that the colp, they think that the colpe is them.
So the final result is that we're better, we feel better, objectively, but we feel worse.
Let me remind you you about it.
This is the official dog, what we all take for good and it's completely fail.
There is no doubt that a little bit of choice, and that you don't have a lot of choice, and that was a lot better than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit more than a little bit.
There is a critic, magic value of it. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have super-sure we have super-piece of the level where the best choices our life.
Now, from the political point of view -- I have almost ended -- from the point of view is the follow.
What it allows you all this choice in the industrial society is the material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about a lot about it, and you know how much of the problem is not that choice.
The problem is that they have too population.
So the face that I'm talking about is a malesclusive to be exclusive of modern, rich societies --
And what does depressing and array is this: Steve Levitt told you about iering how those expensive and seat and seat birththish are inuseful. It's a spret. It's a spret.
I want to say that these choices, complicated and dispendous, it's not just useful.
They're the letter deleted dely.
They make it worse.
If a little bit of what in our societies allows a lot of choice, where people have too poor or better, it would not just be their life better and better life and better life and better life but also --
This is what economists call a better paretian.
A redict redition is well well -- not only to the poor -- not only the poor poor -- because of this choices that I will come back in except ush ush us.
And to conclude he said, "Fole, you can become everything that you want,
I mean, you know, what do you think you said, "What about that weight is what that fish?"
"It's obvious that you can't do anything in a vetet."
"A chastrat, a view of the world."
and I anke, I had been pretty much in the beginning.
But then, I think about it, ago I realized that that fish, the long way that fish.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you go to franks, so that "everything is possible" you don't get freedom. You get freedom.
If you rom the mouse in a way that all become possible to be deft.
You can get the paralysis, and you reduce the good.
And they need a sphere.
This is almost certainly too streted, maybe even for the fish, and sure for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic and temple, for the rovine.
Thank you very heart.
