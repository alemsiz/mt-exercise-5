The last year, I showed these devictims to show that the calculator, which is for almost three million years has had the size of three million years has had the size of 48 percent, the continents, is reververtip-percent.
But this subject to the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice of the ice problem because it is not the ice of the ice of
The calculation is to arttical artle, the heart of the climate system.
You go and saves and reverse and you get reverse to extince.
The next devices is going to be a very quickly degrees of the last 25 years.
The glaces are reverse in the red reververty.
As you see it, you get to the blue blue blue blue box.
That's the ice in inver, which is the range of esticated.
You can see the cosident of the mix, five years or more than the blood, which is like the blood of the body.
In 25 years is past from this way.
This is a problem because the remarkable of the ground ground ground of the ocean artical action where there are enormous amount of carbon on and the same thing that if you get into the microbies.
And I think about the totality of the inquining atmosphere from global warming the most initial of the indiculating this point of not reporting this point of not report.

If you look at the context story. If you can see the conversations.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 hours -- 25 million tons -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the Pacificence of the Pacific, by Amermer, and on the Amermer, and on the subcontinent parts of the subcontinent -- where there is a radical reveral ocean.
The bigger of the global warming warming, with deforestation, which is the 20-percent, is the use of the reforestation, is the use of the deforestation,

These are the projects of swwimming in the last years and some proposition.
In every way, there's a lott-political lottonishing in our Paese Paese checke.
The carbon industry and the carbon die of oil has a 250 million dollars in the last year for promoting carbon on the last year for promot-year-miles.

Thank you very much.
The last year at TED I have a introduction on LHC.
And by re-re-re-re-hold to how to work the machine.
So I think about the other time you don't have to have no longer -- the LHC is the biggest experiment -- 27 miles -- 27 miles -- 27 miles of the conference.
He's reacting the rear conditions that were expresent of a second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second to 600 million times a second.
All of this is just the environment.
This is the machine machine in Gev.
We do these mini-Big Bang in the rise of the rise demonstrators.
This is what I work work on the AS -- is clarge-feet and has a diameteter diameteters in 2,000 feet.
This is an image imagining of AS in building so you can see the proportions.
The 10 sectors of the last year we have accession for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immense to control in the healthy of control.
It's a first fasking of the first fasking particles that had done all the LHC, in the LHC, and deliberately, with a part of the LHHC, and spreading particles in the rise particles in the rise of the LHHC, and spreading particles in the LHHC
In other words, when we see that the image the 10 sector, we understand that the machine that the machine is a great lives.
I don't know if it was to do it on the other opposites and I went on to Google and vide that the pay was this:
That means that we had a cultural impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact
Look a week later, it was a problem with the machine, because they had to these movies -- these movies -- these movies -- these movies -- these movies -- these movies -- these movies -- these movies -- these movies -- these movies are going to do this movies -- these movies you know, these movies -- these movies are going to be a door.
These movies are 13,000 lands when the car works works at the massive potence.
Now, the technical techniques are going to look at the movies and die -- "Don't be there.
And instead they can do it because when they are very fredy cosided with the superconductors.
So, at least 271 graps, to a temperature in the stellellow of the stellelles, these movies can bring that fall that they can bring that clear.
In one of the most of the most population of the magnetic LHC, there was a difabrication.
So the movies are going to give me a little bit about 13,000 miles, and 13,000 miles les a resistence of electric.
This was the result.
Now, this is still more impressive impressed if you think these magneters more than 20 tons of the tons and that are slaptops about 30 centimetries.
They are damong about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to do that, what we did we have done.
We have repristers and and advertis-repristined and beust.
They are return to all the place to their own place to their own place.
English the end of the LHC will will be new inteer.
And I accend, and we think about the data to get to the right or or or him, and continue to find what the morning, and continue to find what the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain certain ways, these incident reaccending the debate of science and engineering the engineering of science and engineering the engineering of science and engineering to confute.
I think the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the value of things like the value of things like the LHHC.
I want to conclude with the parts of a scientist Ingland, Humphrey Desespecially the quale, image, the quality, and I think, in the inject of his pullll, his pulls of the Michael Farady, "No is that the remarkable of human mind that the ideas of human ideas that are not going to have to nature of the minddddynames that are not going to be a new month of our minddgame of the money, which is that we don't don't don't don't have to be be a new ideas that that that our our our our our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own ideas of our our
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to report to think about how to do you get cooking cooking coos.
And then you understand how to reach them and reach them and they can take them and move them and they learn how to think and solve problems and to solve problems and so much of space.
The reason is to the reception, connected to the way we understand most of the world around us.
So, by informatic informatic object of our interaction with the construction of our interaction with my construcstruction and my collaborator, and I started to ask my collaborator, I started asking asking her: "And when we use a computer, instead of the mouse of the mouse that the policy of the mouse that we could just have a little bit about the same way with the same way to be seververtoldrameply with the information with the severververe,
and systems to our life?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the risk rising risk, building the Siftable.
In fact, a little bit of a Siftable is a great computer is a great way of a biscooe.
In fact, a little bit of a Siftable is a great computer is a great way of a biscooe.
You can see the man, they can see the man, they can see the hand they feel the movement and they feel the movement and a radio wireless and a radio wireless.
But most of course, are objects like the morning, as the morning, you can just just just folds.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem for a new ecosystem.
And as they become more physics, consciously, consciously, the other movement, and they have to be more physics, and they know how to become more physically consciously, the other people like the model of the others, how to make new and different and and and functions.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configuring to show the video, if you have to show the video direction, the video rooes that if you walk from the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the video round.
These ritrates are consciously, you know about others.
If they are in the ison, they are interested in what they are going to be done.
If they get to the circumstances can agitate a pose and they can agree a little bit of it.
If they get to the circumstances can agitate a pose and they can agree a little bit of it.
They also have their movement and initization.
And then we realized that one of the interaction was the interaction of the interaction of the data on the data, to example "versare" a like the way was a fliquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable to the smark and I can use them to be able to the central and I can use them to the central of the central conversation.
and I can use them to be able to the central color in the central surface.
If we have a lot of the way, we can reach a little bit of it.
I'm also beautiful and possibility of emption, as the language, and mathematics and mathematics and where people can try and see the things that are going to try and see the results of the results of the results of the results of beat.
Now I'm going to do it --
This is a sequence of Fibonaces that I do with a equations.
Here we have a parts of Scarabeo and Boggle.
Pratically, to every turning of every turner, in every Siftable, Praticle, Pratice, Pratice, and as you try to get a literally on a country, and as you try to make a drugs.
And then after about 30 seconds of the remiss and have a new new tons and new chance to try and new possibility to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try and new possibility and new to try to try to try to try and new possibility to try and new possibility to try to try and new possibility and new possibilities.
Thank you.
Here's what the kids came to the Middle in Lab, I did it in the way that I tried them and I took a video.
They are like to be a lot of it.
And one of the things of this kind of appreciation is that you don't have to give people many educations.
You just said, "Compons of parole," and they know exactly what to do.
That's how to other people who trial.
This is our better-old young people and more young people on the street.
And it was actually wanted to only employees.
They just were just morning, for him.
Now, this is an applation of a cartone interactivity.
We wanted to build a tool-building tools for the ling's Flix.
It can be able to make new persons in the scale of the Siftable to their associated with their associated and their associated with their associated and
It can be able to make new persons in the scale of the Siftable to their associated with their associated and their associated with their associated and
So that's doing it out the sold.
Video: The sole is surgend.
David Merrill: Now it took a treator the scale of the scale.
Video: The treatment arrange.
Bel work!
So schools are Siftable and put it in the neighborhoose can do the characters --
Video: Bau!
and inventing its own story.
Video: Ho!
DM: It's a story with final final final and it can decide it as you wrote it.
DM: It's a story with final final final and it can decide it as you wrote it.
Volo: Vulule,
DM: The last example I have the time to show is a tool, I did this -- to be recently, to be recently and exequals and exequals and exequals and exeguing music.
one tool, I did a tool, I did it for the music and exeguing music.
The Siftable here are going to be based on the bottom and bacteria and bacteria and bacteria
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what using it.
You can insert these suddenly constructed to a construct to your life.
And it just defliping a "so" and a "so."
These are actually actually you can control from live in the reverse and the movie.
The attaches to a particular and then then you have a particular and then sinclens to the stand then you get it.
And then there are the general effects like time and you want to be able to the whole sequence.
Let's look like this.
Video: We are going to put a couple of Siftable in two Siftable in a series, the systems in a series, the extend to add the express of the extend to the other based on the Siftable of Siftable to the other exend, we can put a serie,
Now I just just put a bass.
Video: Now, I am added to ush the same thing --
Video: And now I'm going to put the bacteria to the bacteria to the effect from live in the living living from the living living from live in the living living of the live.
Video: I can look at the whole whole whole whole whole whole time by a late or a be.
Video: And now I am going to add the bottom to give more expression.
Video: I can recombined the sequence to the sequence ""ap."
So I don't have to planning the first time, but I can have suddenly decorner.
And now, I finally, I can sfuel the whole sequence in the left Siftable to the Siftable "ap."
Thank you.
So, as you can see my passion is to build new interfaces and more like to be more like how to work as well.
And today, I had to show you one of the results of this lost and also some chance that we try to bring out out of the lab.
The concept, I want to transmimit is that this new generation of objects that are going to be able to interact with digital media media in our world in our world.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the now of you talk to all of you.
I am a writer.
And I want to go to my professional exsion is more than this, of course, of course, of course,
It's also the friends and the one of my life.
And I don't expect that it can change it.
But I said that, something particularly happened recently in my life and my carriera, which has to realibrate the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is that I recently recently wrote this biography called "Mangia, Pregion, Ama" -- Pregion, and different things that I was a great great market to be a big world and become a big big world and become a big sense, to the interaction.
And the result is that everywhere you go now, people who were condition to the way they were condition to it.
It is true -- condition -- condannatel!
They go to me to all worried and says, "Don't you have to do not have to do that?
You don't have to keep to write all life without any life without able to create a book that can do a book that you can important, what?"
that can important?
It's rassics, you know.
But it might go worse, in the worth of 20 years ago, when I began to say people -- I was a true adolescent -- I wanted to be a trick writing.
I went to the same reaction of the bottom fol.
And people say, "Don't have to have success?
You don't have a flife-reflied reflife?
You don't have to do this mestiate for all life without any life without any life without any life on a heart of a heart of a samp and the blood of the blood blood to love with failument?
Cuses things, you know.
The short -- the short answer to all these questions is "i."
I have flife-papers.
I always had a flife.
And I also have a lot of other things that people might not have to ind.
As the tree and other things spaventy and other things that
But for how about how to write what I thought I was and ask me to ask me to ask me to the timate timate timate is be?
Is it rational?
It's logic that anyone to be she'd have to be spaded by a work that you have to do.
But what is is that particular in the impresizing to make us to be able to be on the healthy of the minminminds to the other carrier to not fanno?
As my father, for example, he was a chimic engineer and not remember a chest time in his 40 years of activities that was asked if they had to be engineering to be engineering to be engineering to be engineering to be engineering to be engineering to be engineering to be engineering to be engineering and to be engineering to be engineering and to be engineering to be engineering and the way to be able to be engineering
It was never -- that block of the engineer of engineering John, how do you do that?
Would not work on it.
Of course, engineers like a group like group like unclearly, in the secouraged the reputation of being alcouraged to be treated to be treatment.
We writers, we wrote enough to this reputation, and not only writers but creatives of every general, we have this reputation of being enormously reputting them to be enormous to be enormous to be enormous to be enormously reputting them to be enormously reputting them to be enormously reputation of every generough and reputation of every generally reputputation.
And not really, it's another that look at the death of the death of the magnifies that creative creative is, only in the 1st century, just in their century, and often to them.
And also the ones that are not suician data seems to be really, disappeared by their woman's done.
Norman Mailer, before I got to die in the last last interview, my book, my booking, a little bit more extraordinary of your own own life.
But we don't have to say when we feel about why we heard these things so much much to be able to some things that in some way we have completely interiorored and the notion of the notion that the creativity is in some way to get to the art, to the art, to get to the hand the art, to get to the hand the hand the hand the hand the idea is to get to gotten and the notion that the notion of these things that
And the question I want to all to all of those who are you agree with this ide?
I'm going to tell you -- because you also look at the one centimeter to me not good for anything to do this supposition.
I think it's odiose.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great minds creative creative mine.
And I know that I know that in my case -- in my case -- would be very dangerous to start to the same thing I was going to be able to be able to be dangerous to the constances in my career.
Of course -- you know, I'm pretty young and you about 40 years.
I still have about four decade in my work in me.
And it's very likely to be very likely to say that everything is going to be right by the world like the work that used after the work that used to be the last book.
He went back to her, because we're all more or less friends here -- is likely to my biggest success is to my slow on my shethen.
Oh, Ges: Oh, Ges:
You know this is the gene of thinking that leads a person to start to start to the nose to the nose and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to keep this work that we do.
So, the question become it is?
And so so I was several with a lot of reflected, which the way to work to write to create a costructure,
I wanted to find a few way to find a safe of me that I'm writing and my natural anside, and my natural ansize, and I wrote to the last year models and to look at the last year to look at the time to look at the time to see how to do it if they could have to see how much much more and more healthier and more healthy and more and more healthier and more and more and more healthy with the best ideas and more and the past of ideas and more and more
to how to help people create the inerate people who are risks of creativity.
And that research has took me to the antics and antics and antic.
And then you can get to the circle and then you get back to the war.
Nellellels and antics and Roma -- people don't seem to believe that creativity was going to be inhere?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit was to dive and that they come to the men from a few people distant and ssame, and unknown and unknown distants.
The gregregreen will these digging the spirits of creativity of creativity "demony."
Socrate, wonderful, creating was saging to have a sagagriculture.
The Romans were the same idea, but they call that the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the same idea, but they call a genie.
The big thing is -- because the Romanans don't think that a genive genius really really intelligence.
They believed that a kind of this sort of this sort of divina who believed in the last last last few months of the study of a little like the study of a little like the argument and that they come out to the work of the artical work of the articticle and modeling the result of the work of the work of the work of the articke.
It is a exception-distance distance distance of which worse -- that costruck costruck that costruck protects and the result of your work.
And all of them who was so that it was so that it work?
So the antiwho were protons were proud of things, like to the example of the narciside-year-year?
If your work was exceptional -- you can't take it to get all the mer, all knew that they were helped by this genive to the present of this genius to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to take it and all knew that they were helping with this genius to get from this genive genie.
If your work fail, not was all colping in your fail, right?
Everybody knew that was your genive to be a inable inable inable.
And so people han concept, the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then the Ravign came and everything everything and everything is going to be umbing the center of the universe of the universe and the mysteries and the mysteries and the mysteries and the mysteries that write the details from the details to be able to create the details from all the details and the mysteries and the mysteries of the steries and the mistakes, and and the mistakes.
This was the human human human lessons and people began to think that creativity was going to think that creativity came to the ilate of the human foundation came out.
And for the first time in history, you know, the referrring this artical arm like a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a person with genium.
And I have to say that was a big mistake --
I think that allows to somebody else is to create a simple person to be like a recipe of the found, the essentiential and people all the mysteries and unknowing the mysteries is a responsibility of the human being.
It's like to ask somebody to the solar soles.
And I degree distores and creates all these ingestible accountable to lost the lost and creating them and creating them and creates and creating them to lose their lost and creates degrees and creating all these ingestible acts and believe in the ethesison.
And I think was this pression to have been destructed artists in the past of 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think that is the question becomes now.
Can we can do it different?
And as you go back to a more antic understanding of the relationship between humans and creativity and creativity.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't get 500 years of thinking about 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes of the last 18 minutes.
And there is probably people between the audience that sounds the scientific who have been souptty in the scientific notion of the nice of the projects.
I probably wouldn't you walk on this thing.
But the question I would like to do is -- why do you have to do that?
Why don't I think about this way?
Because has more more more more than every other thing that has ever heard to explore expersuits of creativity process of creativity.
One process that you ever have never tried to do something -- so fundamentally, all of this -- -- you know, you don't think of it is to raise -- you don't have to be replace.
And, in fact, it can be completely paranormal.
I did this initiely with the extraordinary Ruth Stone, which has now 90 years old, but that has been a poetch for all life and he said that during his old and he said that during his old and I felt in the Virgurale and the Virging in the camera of the hour was from the landscape to the land.
He said it was like a fragorous training on the airplane.
And that was coming to roll it from her pathy to her hair.
And it goes to to the way to get to the land under his hand its its piece.
You know, you have one thing to do to do that and was words like a morning, "Look like a morn."
And so it goes to the home and came up with this poetry and it would not have to do that a cart of a cart and a price of a card and a fold, the training and the training and the mistake on the page.
Sometimes I couldn't get to be enough to be fast, so correcent and correct and correct and correct it and the rotoled and she was going to keep through and she was going to keep through the pathold, and it would continue to row through the pathold, and then you know, and he would say to her and say, "another poet."
And then there were those times -- this piece of not the people who had been in the moments of the moments that was almost lost lopers --
So, was going to go home and was trying to the past and the past and the past was going to go through the past and then he was going to go through the wallungone with the other hand the other hand the off.
And he was offered the courage and the reduce and the translate and the translate has to the pay pain in the page.
And in these halley is going to be presented on the perfect and I mean to the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last few hesn't presented on the last word at the last word at the last few hallally.
So when I feel about the penguguys -- is exactly the warming process to my creativity process.
Not all my creative process, they're not a constructure.
I'm a mulmult, and my way to work is -- I svehoom on the same orororary and to work and go to to work and go to to the same time.
But even I lost in my headline, I walked up against that thing, I was going to be there.
And I imagine that many of you have a face.
You know, even if the work and ideas came to me and the ideas came from a certain certain foundly I could wouldn't be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to forward
And what is this thing about that?
And how we can we relate to not to do that we don't lose to the head, which you do it in the way, that we do it?
And so much of you repeate for me to do that I have is the musician is the musician Waits, which I interview, which I interview, I interview.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the magazine life was the incarnation of the argument of the argument of the argument of these species of impull impulse species of impulse to create these species of impull impull of emptions.
But then you get it down, and then a day and a day as he was driving on the moves in Los Angeles, changed all for him.
It was going to go and all of a track, and it comes into his head, which comes into his head, which comes into his heads and the inspiration, and the issues and the wants and the want, and the wants -- and the want, but not to know how to take it to take it; but not how to take to take it;
It has no one piece of care, no one has a strator.
So began to feel this sort of old old and to be growing in him and he said, "I'm going to lose and remarranged by this song to lose it from this song to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be growing in the song of the old chang to be growing in the old of the old channened.
I'm not good and I can't do not do it.
And instead of go to the pania, you stop.
It was going to do it and he did something completely new one.
He just said, "Don't see it and said, "cus," I don't see what I'm driving that?"
"Who seems that you wrote a song song or song?
If you really really want to exist, you get a more opposition.
And I got to get anyone one else today.
I wanted to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his work work on the work work on this.
I don't have to work was still happy how it was still happy to be in the way,
But the process, and the fish of the weight was released when the previous meeting when the genive was going to be druged by the same thing and freedom and free it was going to be a whole thing.
but it soubbe, wonderful bizarnight a collaboration of a conversation and this thing that strange and this thing that was going to be in Tom.
So how the story that history is also to change a little way I was working and I was already going to save me a time.
This idea, I got save me when I was writing my "Mangia, Prega, and the hasn't been writing in a disperation that we all have when we work on something and we can actually be a disaster and starts to think that is going to be the worth of the worse that is going to be the worse that is going to be the worse to be the worse to be the worse to the worse that is going to be the worse
Not only good worst book was writing the worse writing.
And I began to think about to see this project.
But then I remember Tom that parking on the air and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and
So I put my face on my face on the hands and directly and I would say, my comment, and I would say, the hold of the room.
And he said to you, "Most -- you know, what we know if this book is not going to be brilliant to not be good at mix, not, nothing?
Because as I see that I'm going to put all the ho, I don't have more than that.
So if you want to be better -- you have to deal with your parts.
Okay, but if you don't know what you don't know about it.
I'm going to write it to write the same because it's my work.
And I'd like to do with favor that I was going to do my worth -- because -- the end is the end of the North th th th th -- several is in the North th th of the North of the North and clearly of the dances and music.
And they were always magnified, because the ballers were professionaleras and they were fantastic.
But every one of course, something happened, something happened, and one of these artists became actually actually translate change.
And I know what you talk about what you have to do is that you have seen everybody, a lost point, a lost of it.
It was like the time you stop the ballery and the ballery of the ballery of the sun, as the sun, as the 1,000 night --
And in suddenly not just like a human human being.
But you accepty by the decade in the devictims.
And when this happening was going to the time people knew what it was called the not. They were called her not.
They had the manupon and starts and starting to cant, "Allah, God God, God."
That's God, you know.
Curious historical -- when the Mororest of Spain, the south of Spain, they were the saves of the Spain with their own hand, "Lah, he said, "Hey, he said, "Hey, which you can still feel in the flames or in the corries or in the flamens.
In Spain, when a argument has done something impossible and magic and magic -- and he said, "Good, black -- a foundation, and it can actually understanding -- one last last last last last last year.
And it's great because we have to have to have new.
More the problem comes the day later, for the door -- when you sweeping and the milk that are the 11 of the Martedged Martedged and last last last year.
It's just a deal with big male with big male to each other, and maybe never could have to make that treatment.
And maybe nobody dog the name of God still as a given as a giving of his lives?
It's difficult to it.
This is one of the most pathorical recognize to do in a creativity.
But maybe it has to be so angotting if you could not believe that if you could not believe that the most extraordinary of your own being from you to be so much more extraordinary.
But I believe that they are just going to be in prester to a inimaginable of this team that is going to have to have to someone else you have to have a little bit of your life when you get to it.
And you know, if we think about this way to change change.
And so I started thinking about my land, and it's sure as I thought, as I thought, for different months during the public I will have been in the public public door chronics, the dangerous door expressed my bigger.
And that I have to keep to say when I feel that I feel else.
I don't know. It just just your work.
He was to presenting you to presenting your parts, whatever you can be.
If your work is balling, bally.
If the debt, I put the delight-game decide to leave the orgeous of this is just to a little bit of this is just to get to the tusforce of your sforce and then "Ok!"
And I triment, I got to the same your dance.
And "Oh, y!" "Yes."
I think I think I guess to teach.
"Oh, in the same, even for had to have a love, and the headlines of talks to do it presenting to get to deal with it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've already talked about some of these projects on the genome of humans on what can meaning and the discoveries of new genes.
Now we're starting a new lost we started digital biologist and now now to start digital and now to start to the digital biologist we are in a new fassure, designing and sinting life.
We always have to do with the big questions.
What's the lives of something that a lot of biological I think they have to try to understand the levels.
We tried different approach, reducing different process.
We're digital digital remarkable to almost 20 years old.
When we sequenced the genome of the world was going to spend from the world of the biological world of the computer.
Now we can regenerate life on this digital to create a new life from this universe to this digital digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organisms, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the kind of the genome of the little bit more little between those that can cars in the lab of the lab.
And we tried to reduce reduce the genome to create a little bit more small than that.
We can be able to limine a hundred of genes about 500 of the genes of the 10 that are here.
But when we take a checkey to his map is relatively to the nostr.
I think this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimind, one to the time, is very impossible to take a cell cell that can bring a cell cells in the window.
So we decided that the only only only to progression was sinting this chromosomes to get this chromosomes to make the components to take some of these questions.
And so we started the windnurt of the "Can we can sweet?"
Can you feel about conserving these great molecules that we never could have have to do before I do that we never done.
And in case in case of that, we can do a chromountain?
A chromosomes is just a piece of material in a chimic channel.
The spespeed with we have to digital life is growing the life is growing to remarkable to remarkable to remarkential exponential.
Our ability to write the code code code and more than it is immultimately, but it's improgregreen.
And our most recently, the results the laptop on a curve current to a curve current curvent to a curve current results.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has asked a remarkable repression with a bioetic revision before we start with the first experiments.
But we found that sintetizing DNA is very difficult to the DNA is very difficult thing.
There are decade of thousands of cars in the world that products of DNA, the long chapp and is a degenerative processes and is a degenerative proces: the most important, more mistaks are the most mistaks of them.
So we had to develop a new metothod, and correct the mistakes, and correct the mistakes.
And this was our first trip to our first trip to the digital information from Phi X 174.
It's a little virus that kills kills that kills kills that kills kills that kills kills that kills kills that kills kills that kills kills.
We designed the framments, effectively the reporting of the mistakers and get a molecules and have a lot of about 5,000 literally.
The interesting part of the thing is when we took this piece of material and we have this is inserlied in the bacteria have inserlied to read this genetic and provivivivivial particles and provide particles
The particles have been releaved by the cells, are coming back and they come back and they have distruck Ecoos.
I talked about recent with members of the industry of the industry that they have certain that they have certain acts that have certain pattern.
They have rereduced more of you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software really going to build his same dead in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the biggest things in the biggest things in the biggest thing.
We wanted to build the whole chromosome.
They're more than 580 miles of code code code code genetic code of code code genetic code genetic meeting.
So we thought we have thought about the virus, so that we can change the virus, so that we can change the casses, to understand what the components of a cellual cells.
The projection is crucial projections in a digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurate to be very accurate it.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accurateless of a milk for every 10 miles.
We discovered, we discovered, 30 mistakes. If we had the original surprising that sequence is not to be able to be able to do it works.
A part of the process is designing segments that you soved the 50 beings that are with all other segments with all other segments that 50 letters of the most small jobs.
We are going to be in the unclearning here.
You have a little bit of you have a flight.
Think of this -- we have a genetic code on four literally laptop and T.
And those of those lands together with the codifice about 20 friends about 20 friends, and there's a specificfice of the laptop for every friends.
So we can use the genetic to write words, fraise with it.
What we did we have to do this was emography.
Some of some were deluses that was not a poems.
We designed these segments for a few years just just to be able to be with miles.
There are income and they repair and put them and put them and put them and put them on it.
And we started to get to the start, starting with seven miles from five to seven miles, the literally unking-mild-four miles to get to 72 miles, the literally to get to 72 miles to get 72 feet the literally.
And every past we have these segments in these segments in the abababout, so that we're trying to create a proception of a proception -- how you're going to see in a minute.
We're trying to automatic the process.
So, this seems the tabellite of a flow-based tabellow tabell.
When we get to these segments in the most of 100 miles, not growing more directly in E.
It goes to the climate tools of modern tools of biology molecule.
So we have to look at other months.
We know about another multimately called recombination recombination of the biology is that in biology is to repair to reparate the DNA to reparate DNA to be able to be able to be able to report the same thing to resister to recombination the geniologist of another months.
Here's a example.
This organisms, called Deinococcus radioococcus radiation.
You can see in the reduce as the dangerous falls in the distructure.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly how it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can chair all of it.
They can live under the one.
I'm absolutely very certain that life existing in space, and you know, and you have to find new environments of water.
And I mean, the NASA has showed that this lives.
This is a molecules of the molecules that we have built these procession with the life-recise designed representing with the segments.
The liver, they resembling automatically.
This image was not taken with a microscope with a microscope of a microscope rule.
It's a molecules that we can see the great way we can see the microscope of lawer.
These are images that cover a few years of about six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago.
These are more than 58,000 lems of code code code genetic code
It's the molecules of a definitely ever created by man.
It has a lot of a lot of a 300 million inities.
If we stamp with a career 10 without spring 10 without spring this code just to translate this code to translate this code code this code to the genetic cars.
Now, how do we do that? How do we do that?
Of course, trams a virus is a game from a girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use the bacters.
It's also simple when it's also simple cells of cells like our not, you can just estraring the nuclear and inserirs a little bit of the nuclear process of clonely the process of clone.
In the bacteria is the chromosomed is a cell of the cell cell we have recently showed that we're able to do a trapic cell of a chromosome of a mosome, and the other and activity.
We have a chromosomes a romosome of a microbial microbial model del del light.
The two are different things that men from topis.
We added some gene more in the way to be able to decide which you can decide to this chromouns.
And then it has to be with the insume to killing all the protects of the protect.
And when we put in the cell was stupends -- and you can appreciate our graphicoto -- the new romosomes -- the new chromosome.
And we really began to think we couldn't go to the way to go to the spingerer to spinger:
This is one of the majororism of evolution.
We found that very antime sort of a second or a third romosome, a third romosome, I added up in a second thousands of new trats of the species.
So who think about evolution as a only gene to evolution that you have a gene of the biologist has not to understand most biologist has no good than biology.
They are the imples called "re-in-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-construction is that we adrights the DNA.
The chromosomes that was in the cell doesn't have a one.
The cella-tail-tails that we've inserserit-tail.
And it is expressesed, and it has recognized the other ground, and it has been reduced with only the cell cell cell cell with only the new cell and the new mountain the new mountast.
It's become blue blue of the genes that we've insert.
And in a short of time, all the carry of all the cars of a sort of a species are going to be able to be able to the new software that we insert in the cell cell phone.
All the protects are changed, members are changed, and when we read the genetic code the genetic code the genetic equival of what we have has transference.
Now, this might look at genetic music, but to the software we able to change the software we able to change the things in a lot of replace.
Now, I already already explained that you don't talk about the progress -- but of progress -- and a half million years and a half and a half of evolution, and I told that maybe we're going to create a new version of the explosion of the explosion of the explosion of this digital process.
Why do you do that?
I think it's obviously enough when we think about our necessary.
We're going to go to spend six billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give you a example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet. In 1946; 40 years, are going to be four.
We're going to do now now now to find the freququest and the blood and a half billion people.
It will still be more difficult to do it for nove nove to do it for nove miles.
We are more than five billion carbon and more than 30 billion bars of boil.
That means a million barild of barils to day.
When we try to find biological process, or any kind of remarkable process, it's going to be a huge challenge.
We need to keep all the emission of CO2 from these materials that it flies that flights the atmosphere.
And on the day, thank people in the scientific discoveries in all the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the components to design the future.
The electronic industry has just a dozen dozen of components, and think about things are coming out of the things are coming out of the things are coming out of the things are coming out.
Our limits here are the biological productive reality and from the reality and from our imagination.
Now we have the techniquques to these metoes of sintetization, can create what we call the genomics of combinator.
We can build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes to the day.
Think of these 20 million genes of these 20 million genes or to try to try to try to try to produce either drugs or drugs, new team, new team, and to create more biologist and create more biologist that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a sex-standard.
We can choose to survive, production or production or carbon and production of vaccines and production production of vaccines and calculations.
This is an instantanea of some software are working on which we're working for being able to be able to be able to sell and design species to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to sell and design species to be able to sell selling and design species to be able to be able to securcurity and design species to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to selling selling out and design programming and to sesesecurcurcurcurcurcurcurcurcurcurcurcurcurcur
Well, we don't know how to be year.
We know exactly what the genetic code genetic code code code code code it.
Now we're going to focus on the carbon of fourth generation.
You also saw you have seen that you extremely have been a grased experiment was a experiment ent ent of the grass.
We have a few more more than the generation that used to use enough to the slow of the highest degrees of more valuable than the highest flower and different kinds of ways,
But the only way the biology can have a great impact without increasing on the cost of food and limiting and limiting the inner of food and limiting is going to be able to design the CO2 in the first carbon cells that can be able to design this provide that can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do about 18 months.
The next combined with the CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discoveries in our discoveries in all the world, we found different metos.
This is a organism that we've debed in 1996.
They live in the ocean deep in the deep to the temperature of the water temperature of water.
They believe it from CO2 using hydrogen molecules like the energy of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can inch the CO2, which can be translated to be translated tramite that CO2 in carbon and the carbon on the carbon on on this process.
So the short we think we might be able to increase what the question of "What the question of "What is the neighborhood" is Nobody is Noen, the demonstring interest industry.
Esattently. If you can't do it from TED, where you do that?
It would be a main of energy.
And so, we're working for using the same metods to use the stage to create vaccines to create vaccines of anethanes.
You saw this year with the influence, we're always going back to a year and a year and a year and a year when it comes to find the window of the vaccine.
I think what you can build vaccines in anticiptices in anticips.
So here's how the future might start to be changing to change evolution, accelling evolution, accelling evolution, accelling evolution, and then finally cellpharootic cells.
We are so so much from the people.
Our purpose is to do it in a way to live enough to try to try to try to try and thank you very much.
First of all you will see the fastest -- some more quickly possible, some fundamental technology that we took to the Microsoft followed a year a year a year is a year as a year as a year is Seadon.
It's a local where you can interact is to local a local amount of data that is a huge amount of data data on the visual data
We're seeing a lot of a lot of a digital photos with a digital kind of a zoom and continue, to a speak for a little bit of panoramics, how we want to do.
And not important to the amount of information that we see in the information that we see how much big these things or things or the imagines.
Most of most common was a digital photograph, but this for is a provided by the Big of Congress, and reenter in the Congress, and reenter in the games of the Congress,
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the only thing that this is the number of plants like this is the number of pixel on your screen. It's also a very flessible.
This is a book of a data, of the data doesn't imagines.
This is Casa desolated of Dickens. Ela representing to a represent.
For demonth is to show you that is not to image, we can do a thing about the general representing is to see that is a representation of a four.
It could be a little bit a little bit of a lawer to read a electronic book.
Don't do it.
This is a more realistic example is a number of of the Look at Look at the Guardian.
Every big images is the beginning of a severtion.
And it really gives you the beautiful experience and beauty and the version of a version of a review of a folding of a quote of a true of a very nature of a lot of a lot of a lot of a very much.
We also did something with the angle of this number in particularly particularly of the Look k at the ardian.
We created a published advertis-resolution -- more than the highest of that you use in a normal normal normal -- and you have insert of the content content ent content ent content ent of the content of the context.
If you want to see the carrying of this automotic career of this automotic care.
Or other models, or even the specific specific species.
And this really deal of these ideas to eliminate the limits on the screen.
We hope that this gentlate signs to put a few to the pop-year-old people to be able to be able to be around.
Of course, the map is one of the most of the most of the most of this kind of technologies.
And on this is not to lot, if we don't know that we have to give them to the field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. soves in the U.N. SSA.
So now we're going to go to something.
This is actually actually actually from the vivision of the webs; you can see it.
It's a project called Photosynthese, which fights two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual researching computer computer computer to be in Noah Snaves of Washington, with the aid of Steve Seitz Szskin US Szsketch of Microsoft of Microsoft and the other other is a very good collaboration.
And it's from the vision of the web, managed by Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern that we can spend to a picture and have this kind of experience and have this kind of experience to solve solution is the last milles.
But the collection of spacectural images here has actually a mean.
The algorits, the computer computer record of these images together, in the way that correspondent to the places that the reals that the reals that the remarkable to the laghi Grases Roccurrases -- all of the roundable of the tune of the aroundation of the de-excepable things are all the kinds of spacececraise and these things are all the spacecture.
I don't know if I don't know if I have to show you some other environment.
There are a lot of a lot more space.
I want to spend to one of the same thing about the other data -- and this is this prototypes -- and this prototypes that we have done to do the first time -- that we did the first time -- to show you what the moment is really really really good to show you what this technology, Phototoynthoynthose.
We had to worry about the legal aspects and say that.
This is a reconstruction of the cattedral of Nototots Dame Flicken Basta digital representing Dame and you get images in Flickr and you get images in the campps, other of these construction of these construction that is discovered to the image that is discovered to the image of this model.
So I'm all sorts of Flickr and have been all the space, and they were all in this way.
And it's possible to do this simple way to do it.
You know, I would never think about finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratifiction to get this kind of accomplished here.
I think you can see that that is a lot of different kinds of different fellow phototos in the cell photos in the SLR, a number of different different different together.
And if you can actually try and try and try and try and try and
Many are block to doctor, etc.
And then some of a few of photographs -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- you know, you can see it in a few of photograph.
This is a place of Notber From recorded corrected.
We can spend from the present of this environment.
The essential is that we can do the social environment of social environment. This is now to take data from everywhere. This is now to take data as a collapse of how to the visual object -- and connected to all those data together.
All those images become connected together, more than the other sum of the parts.
You have a model of the land that emerge.
You think about this as a promote of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual virtual on Earth virtual virtual
It's something that grow in complexity and the people who are using it and the people who are using for who are using using the uses of uses and the useful and and the uspect.
They have a little bunch with metaphor by other people.
If you have the idea of conventing all these sants say the not, my picture of the cattedrate of Notber Dame Dame Dame Dame is to resmark all those dates, and I can use how to use this point of the way to resushes on the way to get a different experience, and to have a little bit of the type of them -- and you have a little bit of the red of the s----hair.
Of course, a consequence of everything is models of all of the most exestorders of every interesting part of the ground, raised and the images of the ground, but by the memory of the memory of the memory of the memory of the memory of the memory of every interesting is the virtual consequence.
Mille thank you.
Chris Anderson: I realized what? What your software you to feel about what your software is that to do is that a certain point, in the next years, all the photographs will be connected togethere?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing is doing is actually discovery.
It makes the hyperlink, if you want to be able to image.
And it's doing it in the content content content content of the imagines.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the remarkable information that many of these images that many of these images are the several of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images that many of these images of these images that many of these images of these images that many of these images of these images of these images that is very interesting and the reverse of these images of these images of these images of these images of the reverversesesesesesesesesesesesesesesexual images of the antic information of the reveral information of the respectel
As you have a research of images on the web, you know, the head-pay images on the pay has a lot of information about the images of the phototos.
Now, what happens if that images you connect to all the vote of your photototoes to the number of hot?
So the amount of interconnections and the amount of the remarkable of remarkable to be a very huge classical classical clical effect. It's a classical clics.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BAA: I'm going to thank you very much.
One of the main in when you traveling and a deliptie and the deliption is the way to live in who has to live in who has been the antic antic antic antic antic antic antic and the past, and the samp of the plan in the waves of the saving and the game of the plants.
Basti think that the chamans Jaguar traveling the Lattea, or that the stands of the older of the old-year-old hold hand, or in Himalaya, or the budden of the Dhardly rely the idea that we don't have the idea that the importance of the world that we don't have the idea that the idea that we don't don't have a sense of the reality of reality is just a model of the reality of the realm of the reality of the world
The consequence of a particular extra choice to adaptation that our stirs has done -- a lot of generations ago.
And of course, we all share the trator of the expensive.
All we all all recreding.
We have dreams to report the beginning.
We need to deal with death of more, so we don't take it to the whale and whalliame,
We all have a art.
What it is the particular one particular one of the doging, the ritish of every culture.
Not important that are the forests of the Borneo, or the following of the Voodoor Haiti, or the woods of the Western Kenya secentrional in Kenya camera Curandering in Kenya camera in the heart of the Sahara.
He was my own own own my own own desert in desert a month ago, or a saller of the yargument of the world.
All these populations are teaching us that are other ways of existing other ways of thinking, other ways of people who are in the world.
And if you reflected, it's a not. It's a concept, you can give you to give you it.
Inside, the mirrration of cultures of the world creating creating a spiritual and cultural life and cultural and cultural is to the biological warm of the planet as the planet as the biological house.
And you can think about this raildry cultural as a hetnosfe and you can call the fallnosfe of all the way to be the same concept, the way, and the same idea of all the way to be from humans to be from the human consciousness from the alonge.
The wonderful is the fantastic is the fantastic of humanity.
It's the symbololds of what we can be in how much species that we can be in how we can be in how to initive.
And because the biosphwas was really consumed by the way was happening is to the nisfe and so much more quickly.
No biology, for example, it would say that 50 percent of all the species was or is the orest of the exestination is just because it's failed -- in the expocalculators -- the most biologists -- and you don't have to have a little bit more optimistic than cultural -- and you have to be more optimistic -- the other other other other other other cultural than cultural --
The indicates is obviously all of course, the lost language.
When you're born in the same planet.
One of the language is not just a vocabolary or from a series of rules of rules rules of rules es of rules.
One of the spirit of human spirit of human spirit is the human spirit of human spirit is the human spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of human spirit.
It's the middle of every culture of every culture in the world.
Every language is a forest, a back, a magazine, a plane thinking, a ecosystem.
And those those 6,000 language, as we are here in Monterey, also, half is not a little bushed in the orececkers and children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's sedity is not to be more sushed in the earlier of the children.
They don't have to teach the kids, the means that they don't have to be anything, which is already death of them are already death it.
What is is more trister than the end of the silence of the last to talk about a language to talk about a language of the saggeon and the saggegeon on the daughter?
This is going to take flifeed it in some of any two week: every two weeks a little bit of a hold and a little bit of a language of a language of a language of a language of a language of a language of a language of a language and a language of a language of a anticical.
And I know somebody who who are not better than you say that?
The world would not be a better place if we all all the same language of all the same languages of the yoruba.

What does it mean to you say,

If we ask the way to stable to say "Well they say, "Those to say "Those ose to the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of it.
The solution is is the 17 variety variety in a night of a bunch and each other.
With this doesn't take a laughing Harvard, but it's much more interesting than contare in the stams.
Now, [[[[[[[the problem is that also the most of us who have to heart them to be painting them into the history, and a few way to our reduce reduce to our respect to our respecting.
In fact, the Xth century, 300 years old, not to remember the wards or his wards or his failed and the technology that was that we stopped and we have to accept and we have to accept the destruction of mass and cultural destruction of the mass of the planet.
All cultures through cultures have been involved in a dance to new possibility to new possibilities.
And the problem is not the technology.
The Indian Sixxyan have not to be Sioux when they put out and frequency and free free and calculating them to be Americans when they put out of the hotot.
It's not the change that the technology that minate is the integrity of the innosfer. It's the poterms of it.
The next to flit of the domination.
And if you give a sat at the world, you find that these are not culture destined to swise.
They are creatures and dinamics and dinamics out of the existence of the identified and the income of their adaptation and the ability to adapting.
The thing that you have a disbodies of the thought of the thought of the thought of the Penanchchchcheck --
a popular population of Sarawak, in the suddenly of the population that has lived to a generation that has lived to a generation of the inforests and reduce to the degrees of reduction on the degree of the reduce that seems to see the books that seems to be able to the books that seems to be the initial ded, where the income to the injapons the inities.
It takes to reempies with the checks with the forest.
Of course, in the Yanams, are the diseases that have the diseases that have come with the discovered of the earlier.
If we slow us on the tages of the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research, you see the political market of the politics.
As you know the genocidie, the exestination of a popular population, but the universal level level, but the destruction of the style of life of the style of life is not not not not just to have to destruct in certain development because it makes you a lot of developing developing development.
And you can't understand the sufference of Tibet in the window until you start it.
I lost the 6,000 miles from China China China China and the Cina in the Tibet in the Tibet in the Tibet of a young line, but only came to Lhasa Lahasa Lahasa Lahasa Lahasa young to talk about the statistics.
6,000 monuments in the policy and energy.
1.2 million people killed by military during the Cultural Right?
The father of this girls was assumed to Panchen Lama.
The one that means that that was killed to have been killed in the Chinese theless.

He's mother was imprisoned and her colping and her colpe.
It was taken to the hold of the age of two years on the road of two years nose years on his gonto be without him.

A day has inverage a calculation a fashion the Map or and the Mao and a translate was actually actually in the milles, for seven years.
The pain of the Tibet can be inexpresent in the population of the population of the population is to keep present.
And finally, all of the find, all you get a choice.
We want to live in the world of the monotony world or we want to accomplize the policymer of different monotone?
The great antropolooga Margaret Mead, before his biggest is that his biggest is that his biggest folding was that in our own own own own the world of the world is the whole game, but a lot of the human imagination.
And it's upon to remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolitic Right ght to the Neoliter's recolor, which has done us to the cult of the several cultures of the clerate of the cler's clerarching of the clera, creating the hold of the special cleration, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern world industry has been 300 years old.
And that is not suggests that we have the risk that we have the risk of all the challenges that we have to have to deal in the millennique.
When the culture of these cultures of cultures of the world is asked to be humans, responding to be humans, you know, with 10,000 of us and a different different way.
And it's in these answers that we all all answers to be what we all have to be what we know is a kind of consciously, that has to do that all the people and all the giving argument and all the giving moments of optimimimiles.
I took this picture on this picture on the north of BBa's Aran in the Ba's win, and this man's waving -- and this men with the wonderful story of his grandmother's grandmother's wonderful story of his grandmother's deal.
The government has not been always gentertaining with the popular popular and the '50 to stable and in the '50 to stable to our preprices in the force of the old.
The grandmother of this man has reflighting to go to it.
The family for his life, my life, his portran all the argument and all his cars.
You should know that the Iwwouldn't have the freding, the slummmultimate.
The packs of the slittune were actually to fish in the packles were in the package of caribs.
The grandfather of this man didn't have to notice by night by the broughly or from the broughly to the broughly to get to the blood of this man is that suffering or from the brought of this man is to notice by the brought by the blood or to the brought by the broughly to notice from the broughly of this man who has been reververtimit from the bing or from the belelely.

It has been schooled the dog and created a brillia, with the cassy has created a slittle, has a little bit of a chang and has been swalk on the bunch of the key caccept in the chain.
We want to talk about the honto the nithete? And this in different ways, and this in different ways, and this is the symbololist of the population of the population of the world.
In 1999 government 1999 government has rerereminded to the Inuit has rerely reverse to a total area of the California and the Texas a Texas well.
It's the new them.
It's a reminmine or independent. They all the resources of resources.
One of the splendid, as a nation-state community to recognize with his population of his populo.
And for finally, I think it's pretty obvious than you have been in these areas of us was in these area, makes it that they are not to be able to be remote that are not not to be remote to remote that are not to be in the remote of us is very obvious.
So anybody is home.
They have presenting in the human imagination of humans who risk at the trees of the temples. And for us all these kids, as the children are becomes part of our daughts of our children's minds of hope.
For us to finally finally we have to convince that political will never be able to get to swimming to nothing.
We believe the polemisphere --
[Applausian is not love, but we believe the stories of the stories can change the world, and maybe we have the best institutions to tell the world of the world is to tell the world of our sirice.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you have heard and to have heard and proverse some lines and reverse some lines and not noclearly to them with it.
I want to start with what I call "the official dog's officiicial officier.
The dogal official of what?
The dogal official societies industry industry industry industry in the official and official benefit to be the benefit is a little bit of our city, the way to do is a lot of the freedom is to demonstrate the way to individual."
The reason to a stage, from a land, in fact that the freedom is in the same value, is preptious value, and essential for humans.
And on the other is that if we are freedom to do all of us to do everything that mass our benefit for us to do everything that mass our benefit in nobody who decided to us.
The way to be freeze freedom is massive choice.
The more people are free and more and more and more and more and more and more and more or is their freedom is their own own be.
This ritright, it's so deeply to the society that nobody has to put it in a doubbe.
And it's also deep in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has repossible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly very big it.
I lost a simple note on the delife-conditions.
In my supermarket is 175 conditions, without contained 10 variety of the extrtraceters and the 12 aceters that you can buy a huge number of degrees that you can buy a huge number of degrees that nobody who have have to have a huge number of degree.
That's what the supermarket market.
And then you go to the saves of electronic to buy a stereas a stereas a CD, radio, radio, radio, plast, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, plast, radio, radio, the CD, radio, the CD, radio stereas a CD, casses.
And in this single single guy of electronic electronic components of the audience.
We can do six million and a half different combinations using the components that are in a negotie.
You have to put that is a lot of choice.
Some cameras the world of communications.
One time, when I was a kid -- they could get all the phone of the telephone that they were able to packed by mothers from mothers from mother's mothers from mother's mostly foundation that they were forced by the phone of the phone of the phone of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the phone of the phone of the phones,
It was nowing the phone -- you don't buy it.
One consequence of this, it was that the telephone was that the telephone is not romous.
These times.
We have a variety variety varietyellow phone of the cells of cells.
Here's the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is in the meant is in a meant mechanisms, and force the nose of the nose and forward, and foreign is good for the crystand force it in the snest crystand force in my favorite hanging is in the nose of the crystick.
If you don't have seen in the negodly in the negodly you're going to get to the rest of it.
And what happened is that people in the negogoal in negoties and does this question and does it know what the answer? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that you don't do do do it.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important, is that the same explosion of choices.
Assistence is not going to be more in the United States that you go from the doctors and the doctors and the doctors to do.
I went to the doctor, and I said, "You can do -- you can do -- or B" has these well-folks and these risk" has these risk." "B" has these risk."
He says, "Dotor, what I would like to do that?"
And the doctors says, "A has these benefits and these rises, and they say, and British has these risk."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you say, "Dr. or if she was to me, what do I do to do that?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not lei."
The result of the malato," expression that the malato," which makes it seem to be a beautiful thing.
But it is not that you can actually have to take the fish and responsibility of the decisions from somebody who knows something, and somebody, somebody's doctor, and so it is maled -- and so it is maled -- and so not in the patient.
There's a huge marketing of products with drugs, directly to people like me and you, and you know, if you think about them is not a sense, that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, why do it in public audiences in the audiences of them.
The answer is that they want to do the door called the doctors to ask the remarket to change the ricultural reception.
And that is so fundamental as is our identity is never a question of choice, as you see in this vign, and we want to see the children. We don't want to be a little bit more to the right moment is to invent the right right now.
And we can reinventing us a lot of aggrade.
The one morning, to the morning, to delight, you to decide that you want to be able to be about.
And I think about the family and the maintail, a community skilled community skilled almost for anyway, it was that there was the most prevent of the most prevent and the most prefer prevent to the most preprevent and the most prevent and the most preprevely to the most prevent and the most presize.
The only real choice was with a channed, not what do you do doing.
On day, all of this is really play.
Insegone in students very intelligence, and they do a lot of work at least for a time.
And because they don't have to be dous, not because they are not diligs.
Why are I implentertains, I said, "Do I would have to sposit?"
"Do I have to smilles? I had to think before I had to think before I I would have to the care?"
I'm interrogatic is interrogs.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implementing doesn't have to be able to get the companies that you get to a bel to my exame.
And they have to really, do that. I'm going to do it.
Now, the work of fortunately, we are lucky, like Carl l l subolineavy, every angle of the planet, every angle of the planet, from every angle of the planet, from Hotel Randph.
To parents, there's a angoliner, and not to say to no one quale, where the WiFi From works.
Don't not do it because I want to use it.
What does this incredible freedom to do with the work that we have about the work, we need to keep on to the job, if we need to work or not.
We can go to see our kid today, with the cell phone in a cell phone -- Blackber, and the notebook, and the notebook, and the noteam, and the noteam, and the noteam, and the noteams in the other, and the noteam.
And even if I all have all minute that we see our sonrowing part, we are also asking to this called ""Do I said, "Do I said, "Do I said, "Do I said, "Do I have to say to this called "Do I said, "Do I have to ask the worse,
"I said, "Do I have to say to this literally literally this literally literally literally
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the worth of your kid in your son, very different than what would be in other conditions.
So, from any of any of any little bit of the big objects and stils and stilils and stild of life, life is a choice.
And once the world was this: Ovo, there were some possibilities, but it was not a question of choice.
The world is a little bit of this: The dilemma ism is a positive thing -- or or or negative, or negative?
The answer is the Solold.
The position of the laptop of all of the negative of those negative negative lies.
All this choice is in two effects of the gentertail.
The first parados' minmind, is that produces instead of freation.
With many options in the sheeeches that becomes very difficult to do it.
I offer a meaning example of a study of depensionate on the plane of pensionate pensionate ate depensionate ate ate depensionate ate light.
A connected my connected to have access to the data of Vanicespecially society with about a million clients of climate ate ate ate in 2,000 companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solution that are offerte in the percentage of ademics on the percent.
With 50 percent of offers, there is 10 percent of adedesions when they're available to when they're available to 5. Why?
Because with 50 foundation that you chood, is maleating and the choice is to decide and choice is to the intails.
And I still ask questions, and we still ask questions, and of course, and of course, the questions don't get it.
You can only only only that these work from old old old from old to the food because they don't want to say that the decision is so much about the decision is so the decision is so the foundation of data.
Not they, they're loved to 5000-dollar to the dator of work for the dator of work, that would be disrate in the conversars.
So the paralian is a consequence of having too much choice.
And I think that makes it the world like this.
And "And for the eternity."
You should take the decision -- if it's for the right right to the right heternity, right?
You don't want to take the wrong wrong, and nepray and noption condition, and the condition,
So this is the first effect is that even if we can avive the worthy of the worse and do a choice, at the end of how we should be able to be able to be with less than the falling of the falls of the way the hands of the ground.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with many conditions of conditions that you have to buy a different and is not perfect, is easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that you could do a different choices that the alternative of these is that the alternative conversation and the reduce of the choice, and reduce the recondition of the decision of the degree of decision that you will have to decision from the decision of the decision of these is not perfect.
And as a good decision.
The more choice is that you know, more than anywhere the details that is insection that is insection of the option.
And so, there's what economists, there is what economists.
Dan Gilbert has a very good stamin that the value that we take to the things that we go to what with the confrontitie.
From -- when there are many options of the options of representing the carry of the alternative employees and being less to the opption of the option that is choice.
Here's a example. I scuse with all those who are not New York.
But it's the thing that probably probably think about it.
There's this thing to Hamptons.
A place of the lusside.
It splendid. Ottle,
Not to anything. But that he thinks is "Well, most of the Agodition is Agot."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are vid."
"You could do it right to go to home."
And the past two weeks and we have to lose -- every day -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where you want.
The expensive opportundimine the soddisfation for that we have a check for that we have a check of it.
And most of the options that we have to look at the extra features to the receptions of attentertain to be able to be in the opportunity.
Here's another example.
This journey is a lot of things.
And there is about the moment and maybe the live moment.
But the most important point is that you have to be choice, you are you to do not do not do it.
The things that don't have a lot of these activity activity that can make less attactive what we do.
The third point: The range remarkable growth.
I tried on my praray a new jeans.
And it's almost always jeans.
And once the jeans were a only one of a few of them and they best, they were sweeping them a life and they were sweeping a lot of times, they began to go well.
So, I went to buy a couple of new when the old old of the old who were gented and said, "You need a couple of jeans, this is my tanger."
The committed said, "Li wants to do it fit, do it it and fit, and fit, and fit it do?"
Do you want to do with the bottoni? "Stonees" or "Stonees" or "acidd."
"Would you do do it fall?"
"Would you want to take them or the blado? Bla band the blake --
I was going to go and after a little bit of my I could say, "Do the guy -- which was the only one of which was the only one of which was a little bit of what I was going to try to get to my hans, and then the negoting, and then the negoties, and then the negogoting.
It was the massive mous. With all that I had the met meet meet
But I felt worse to it.
Why? I wrote a whole book to understand it.
The reason I was worse to is that with all that I was that with all the choice were altissslaptops, the jeans had to be perfected.
And I began to expect me to do anything about exceptional existed when it was just a little bit of 100 different places, at least a kind of a different kind of had.
What I had watched was good, but not perfect it.
I had paragoned what I was trying to do with what I was trying to do in the confront,
The add of options in life is not going to increase the expect of the options of the options of the options of the options is to the options of the options are in the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the people are not going to be expectations of the people who are not going to increase the tree.
And this will be less uncomfortable to be good when the results are good for it.
No one in the world of marketing if you have to content.
Because if you know that I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is the most of this.
"You know, the best when it was worse when it was worse to the time when it was worse when it was worst to be worse to met the previous presisize.
On day, in the world that we live -- the developing industry industry with the indication -- the massive massive insustains that we can hope is that the things are going to be treatment.
You never have to surprise evolutions, because your waiting, my waiting and waite, you are ingiant and and they are ingiant and and they are ingiant to be ingiant to be ingiant to be ingiant to be ingiant to be ingiant to be able to be expected.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here is -- "Basasash -- "Bas."
I mean, I can say -- I mean, I am actually sposited and my wife is really really, really, and it's really really really, really, really, really, I mean,
I couldn't do better, I don't have to do better.
But they don't always want to be a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of the bought a couple of jeans sweat, when you are not just that kind of jeans is that when you're not unted, and I said, "Why do you know, "Why?
"Who is responsible to the answer is clear.
The world is the responsible. What I could do about this?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a incomman, and you ask you to ask you to ask you to ask you to ask you to ask you to ask you to be your responsible or you are your responsible or you to be your responsible or you to be pathy or you to buy a responsible and buy a remarkable to you and buy a
You could have have to do better.
With hundreds of variety variety of these are not a scale for the insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even if the result is valive, they feel incomfortable and they say and they say they say it and they say the colping and they say it to their own own itself.
In the last years depression is explosion in the industry.
I think a meaning -- not the universe -- not the universe -- this ondie is to depression is that people have experienced to deludent because the standard are too alone.
And when they need to explaining this situation that the colping is them.
So the final result is that in general general is that we feel worse as we feel worse worse.
Let me give you to me to remember it.
This is the official dogal dogal dog's dogs. It's not true.
There is no double that a little bit of choice is better than not to have any of this doesn't have to be able to be better than a pocke.
There's a critical value of a critical value which is to be there.
But I'm sure that we have super-piece of a piece of a piece of the choice that the choice that the choice that we have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
Now, from the political point -- I have almost finally fined -- the noce, the noce, the noce, the noce.
What it allows all this choice in society is the rich of material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about people who are not in the world, which is not that have too much choice.
The problem is that they have too much pocke.
So the way the docended is a male-sizing malespecial of moderns, which societies societies that societies and societies.
And that makes you depress and array is this: Steve Levitt you have to talk about how to do that consticks and scommote and scomfortable to be inequals for bibes are inities.
I mean, these choices, you know, you know, it's not just inities.
I'm address deleterd.
They make worse worse again.
If a little bit of what in our societies that has a choice that was reversed in those where people have too much much more than the people who have too much much more than the nostrength to get to better but also nose the nostrict.
This is what economists called a pareter paretian implement.
One reduction of the redition is good to all -- not only to be poor -- because of this choice in -- because of this choice in the results.
To conclude and says, "Fically, you can become everything that you want, "
Vooes, people of culture, thought, "But what makes that weight?"
"It's obvious than you can't do anything in a vetror of vetrow of vetrolled bock."
"One imagination of the monstrator a vision of the money, ."
and I have interpretated this thing in this beginning.
But then, I think I was really, I realized that that fisheren't refoundation the long time.
Because the reality is that if you hold the fact that you hold the boccurrent is not to be possible." You don't get to the freedom of the freedom is to be the worse.
If you row the bock in a way that everything becomes possible to dimine the soddisfflight.
You need to get the worse, and you reduce the benefit to it.
They all need a sfer.
This is almost certainly too much too roted, maybe lot, and they safe for us.
But the assassassing of some symbolic sfast is a remarkable to the infelicity and for the rovine.
Thank you very much.
