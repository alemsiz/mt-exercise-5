<unk> year, I showed these <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years had the size of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is 40 percent.
And so this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it's not <unk> the ice <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is, in a sense, the heart <unk> of the climate system of climate system.
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
You see, you see, you're <unk> to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which is <unk> <unk>.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years, is like the blood, which here is <unk> from the body.
<unk> years, it's been so, like this.
This is a problem because the <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that, <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> that, <unk>, <unk>, are <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> this point of not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> is already <unk> from the water.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: <unk>! <unk>: <unk> <unk> is good. The question is if you <unk> it also.
And one reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk>, here is where you <unk> the sea.
These <unk> are <unk>.
<unk> on the planet: <unk>, the largest <unk> of the planet.
<unk> <unk>, the <unk> scientists that the <unk> of ice is in <unk>, and that the <unk> <unk>, which <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> <unk>, like in <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which a few years ago, they were <unk>.
<unk> percent of the world's population <unk> water from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this <unk> is the source of the <unk> water of this city.
<unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, the same happens to the water <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is 40 percent.
<unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, like you read, they're <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the world to a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> are <unk> out of the normal <unk> and without <unk>.
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years than the <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of all <unk>.
If you look in the context of the <unk> <unk>, if you can see the <unk>.
In the last five years, we've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 in the ocean every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day.
Look at <unk> <unk>, the <unk> area, from <unk>, to <unk>, and on both <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean.
The <unk> of the global <unk>, together to <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and the <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> emissions, with China.
And they <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> of direction.
These are the <unk> projects in the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And so, there's a <unk> politics in our country.
The <unk> of <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
<unk> <unk> me something --
<unk> <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
Maybe you saw it on the <unk>.
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America.
It's success around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> â™« <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk>, it's a <unk> <unk> and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and it makes our economy.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>.
It's good price, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, from here's a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The largest <unk> society <unk> on the <unk> is <unk> <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So the <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> has <unk> two <unk>.
This is one of them, one part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk>, we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
So, our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public public <unk> and <unk> the truth.
<unk>, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it's also a good <unk>.
So we don't <unk> of climate change.
We're going to do.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of it.
So, we <unk> a <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of how <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! <unk> are a little <unk>, but this is the sound of the technology of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of <unk> is between the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see it changes everything.
Let's look at this, this is the <unk> technology of <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic <unk> and the national <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> America is in the crisis; the <unk> <unk>, the national <unk> crisis.
The <unk> that <unk> all: our <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk>, like <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the oil <unk>.
Now, but, there's a new <unk>, <unk> solution to <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy, in 10 years.
<unk> <unk> America to <unk> America to work, <unk> more <unk>, and help <unk> the global <unk>.
<unk>, a solution that we <unk> our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> than that.
<unk>: This is the last one.
<unk>: <unk>: It's <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> from the <unk> that we <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, <unk>, a new network.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> for <unk> jobs.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: A old <unk> <unk> says, "If you you want to go to, you go to, you go to you, you go to you,
If you want to go away, you go. "
We have to go away, quickly.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED, I did an <unk> on <unk>.
And we <unk> to <unk> how the machine works.
So, here. And for those who were not, the other time, there were not, the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk>.
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> than a <unk> <unk> from the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times per second.
All that's just <unk>.
This is the <unk> machine.
And we <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk>.
This is what I work. It's called <unk> -- it's <unk> <unk> -- it's <unk> feet and it's <unk> feet.
This is an <unk> <unk> <unk> in building so you can see the <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of the last year we <unk> the car for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was because of <unk> <unk> <unk> in control.
It's an <unk> image of the first <unk> of <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> in <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles in the <unk>.
In other words, when you <unk> that image the 10 <unk>, I <unk> that the <unk> machine, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if it was that to do <unk> more or this, when someone <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> page was this.
What means we've had a <unk> impact on the scientific <unk>.
<unk> a week later, there was a problem with the car, it was to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of the <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you of you <unk> the <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. I'm <unk> too <unk>."
And instead they can do it because when they're very <unk> to become the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, <unk> degrees, at a <unk> temperature <unk> at the <unk> of the space between stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, there was a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
This is the <unk>.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and that's <unk> about 30 <unk>.
They are <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
They're now <unk> to their <unk> place.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be new <unk>.
We <unk> it, and we <unk> to get <unk> data to <unk> or <unk>, and keep our <unk> to discover what are the <unk> that <unk> the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and <unk> engineering <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think the fact that it's so hard, the fact to go beyond the <unk>, I think is the value of things like <unk>.
I'd like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk>, which, <unk> <unk>, which, <unk>, in <unk> of the <unk> experiments of his <unk>, he said, "No," <unk> is so much <unk> for the <unk> of the human mind as the <unk> of the human mind as the ideas of science are <unk>, which are not <unk>, and there are not <unk>, and that are not <unk>,
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> <unk> to <unk> when, from children, <unk> with <unk>.
<unk> as <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way we <unk> the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> of our <unk> <unk> with <unk> objects, and I started <unk>, and my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I started <unk>, "And if we use a computer, instead of having the only <unk> of the <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk>, hands of the hands of the hands,
and we <unk>?
The question was so interesting that I thought I would like to explore, building <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer <unk> like a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer <unk> like a <unk>.
You can <unk> with the hand, you can <unk> them with their <unk>, and they <unk> the <unk> and have a screen and a <unk> <unk>.
But <unk>, are <unk> objects, like <unk>, you can just <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> information.
And as the <unk> they become more <unk>, <unk> of the other, of the other, and as they get more <unk>, <unk> of the <unk>, of the other, like <unk> them, we can explore new <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you, if you <unk> it in a direction, the video <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, so if you <unk> from the other side.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of other.
If you <unk> them, you're <unk>, what's around.
If they're <unk>, you know, you can <unk> it a little.
If they're <unk>, you know, you can <unk> it a little.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We've got to realize that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> <unk> was that that we could use <unk> <unk> on the data, for example, to "<unk> <unk> <unk>."
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> the color in the <unk>, where you <unk>.
and I can <unk> to <unk> the color in the central <unk>, where you're <unk>.
We <unk> too, we can <unk> a little bit of place.
I'm also <unk> <unk> <unk>, like <unk>, like <unk>, mathematics and games and games where people can <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
Now, I'm --
This is a <unk> sequence that I do with a <unk> <unk> program.
Here we have a <unk> game that is half of the <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, at every <unk> <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, <unk>, every <unk> <unk>, <unk>, at every <unk> <unk>, and while I <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk>.
Then, after about 30 seconds, you <unk>, and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> of <unk> and <unk>.
Thank you.
Here, the <unk> children in <unk> <unk> <unk>, I did the way that I <unk> them and <unk> them a video.
They are <unk> very much.
And one of the interesting things of this <unk> is that you don't have to give people a lot of <unk>.
They just say, "<unk> of the words," and they know what to do.
Here, there's other people who <unk> it.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, there's the right.
It's actually wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We could build a <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
Here, is, it's <unk>.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now, he brought a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work! Yes!
So, <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk>, and it can decide how they <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk>, and it can decide how they <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have the time to show you is a <unk>, <unk> <unk>, to <unk> music.
It's a <unk>, I've been <unk>, for <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> here is <unk> as the bottom, and the <unk>.
And so, you know, you can choose what they use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence from <unk> to your <unk>.
And they just <unk> a <unk> of the sound "and a <unk> sequence."
These are actually you can control from the live live, like <unk> and <unk>.
It <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk>.
And then, there are the <unk> effects like time and <unk>, which is <unk> to the entire sequence.
They're <unk> like this.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk> <unk>, "<unk> in a series, the <unk>, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>,
Now, you're going to <unk> a <unk> line.
<unk>: Now, I'm going to <unk> <unk> --
<unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk>, so I can control the effect from the live live.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the whole sequence <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the whole <unk> sequence the <unk> sequence of the <unk> sequence, or the other
<unk>: And now we <unk> the <unk> <unk> to give more <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the sequence of the <unk>. "
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, I can <unk>, <unk> more or more <unk>.
And now, I can <unk> the whole sequence <unk> sequence on the left <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and the body.
And today, I've had time to show you one of this path, and also some <unk> of this <unk>, and also <unk> the lab.
The concept I want to <unk> is that it's <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with the <unk> media, which we want to do it.
Thank you very much.
I can't see the time to talk to you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk> but it's more than this, of course.
It's also the love and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't look like to me that can change.
But, I said this, something particular has happened in my life and in my life, which <unk> me to <unk> the whole <unk> with this work.
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that everywhere, people would be <unk> me as if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
<unk> me, I'm going to <unk> me, and they say, "You don't fear of you don't have to do it?
You don't fear to write all the life without you can be able to create a book that could <unk> to someone? "
What can you <unk> to someone? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could be worse, and I remember, I remember the <unk> of 20 years ago, when I <unk> to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> the same <unk> <unk>.
And people said, "You know," Don't be <unk> to be successful?
You don't fear that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> you?
You don't fear of doing this <unk> for all life without anything else is that you've ever come out and die on a <unk> of <unk>? "
So, you know.
The answer -- the <unk> to all these questions is: "Yes."
Yeah, I fear of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also fear of many other things that people can't <unk>.
How <unk> and other things <unk>.
But, as I'm about writing what I thought and I thought I'm <unk> <unk> is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you can <unk> for it.
But what's so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> about the health <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk>?
How do my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he had fear to be <unk>?
It didn't have -- that <unk> of the <unk> John, how do you go?
You don't know that, you know?
<unk>, the <unk> engineers like the <unk> <unk>, they don't have, in <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not only <unk> but <unk> of all kinds of <unk>, we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk>.
And we don't know that we look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, young and often for them.
And even those who are not <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before you die, in the last <unk>, he said, "Every book me a little more <unk> than" a <unk> <unk> about the work of their life.
But we don't <unk> <unk> when we <unk> it, because we heard these things so long that we have <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are some way to <unk> and the art, at the end, and the <unk>, at the end, and the art, at the end, and that's always <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> all here today is: you agree with this idea?
You're going to do this, because you also have to <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of me, it's not good for this <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better to <unk> our great <unk> to live.
And I certainly know that, in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I'm in my career.
<unk> -- <unk>, look, I'm rather young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that everything will be <unk> by the world like the work that's going to be <unk> by the world like the work that <unk> after the <unk> of my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we are all <unk> or less friends here -- is <unk> that my largest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, what thought!
You know this is the kind of thought that leads to start <unk> <unk> to the nine of the morning and I don't want to do it.
I'm going to continue to do this work that I love.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so, I think, after many <unk>, which way to work to write, and I'm going to do this, and you know?
I have to have to find a <unk> <unk> between me, which I'm <unk>, and my natural <unk> that <unk> to what wrote <unk> <unk>, and as we <unk> for all last year, trying to find out all the last year, trying to find out through the time, trying to find out through the time, looking for the best ideas and see if you have the best ideas and <unk> of the best ideas.
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk> because they <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that <unk> creativity from men, OK?
And it <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> to <unk>, for <unk> reasons and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity. "
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
The <unk> were the same idea, but they <unk> the <unk> that kind of spirit of <unk> without a <unk>.
The <unk> is <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really know that a <unk> <unk> to someone who was particularly <unk>.
<unk> that work. And that was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> literally in the <unk> of a <unk>, a little bit like <unk>, and that <unk> out of <unk> the <unk>, and <unk> out of the artist and <unk> out the <unk> of that work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> you from the <unk> of which I'm talking to you -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work.
And everybody <unk> that was like that <unk>, right?
So artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like, for example, the too <unk>, right?
If your work was <unk>, you didn't <unk> all the <unk>, all <unk> that <unk> state from this <unk> <unk>.
If your work <unk>, it was not all your <unk>, it was not all your <unk>, right?
<unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
Then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk>, and we <unk> this great idea; we put the human being in the universe above all of the universe, and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, and we'll <unk> this great idea;
This is the principle of the <unk> <unk> and people to think about <unk> creativity <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
And for the first time in the story, you <unk> to this or that artist as a rather than one person with <unk>.
And I think, I think that was a big <unk>.
I think of someone, a simple person to believe that being like a <unk> like the source, the <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility to <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's like to someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> and create all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think that's the question, what is, the question, and now?
Can we do it?
They could go back to a <unk> understanding of human relationship between human and <unk> <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking about <unk> <unk> in a 18 minutes.
And there's probably people between the public <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk>, <unk>, you know, you know, people <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> about their projects.
You probably don't tell you about this thing.
But the question I'd like to <unk> is -- why not?
Why don't we <unk> this way?
Because it's more sense of all that that has ever heard of it.
<unk>, as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so, so basically, all here -- so, all here -- knows, you know, you don't <unk> <unk>.
And in fact, it can look completely <unk>.
I did this <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk>, which has now 90 years, but that was a <unk> for all life and said, "<unk> me that during his <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, and I <unk> it, in the <unk> <unk>, and I <unk> it, in the <unk>.
He said that it was like a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk>.
And I <unk> it, because he <unk> the ground under his feet.
They decided to have one thing to do that point and was, words, "<unk> like a <unk>."
And so we <unk> it to the house and he was <unk> by this <unk>, and it didn't have to make any other paper and a <unk> enough enough to, as we <unk>, <unk> and <unk> on the page.
<unk> times, they didn't start to be enough fast, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> through the <unk>, and she would <unk> it to <unk> through the <unk>, looking for, as she said, "another <unk>."
And then there were those times -- this piece of not <unk> <unk> -- there were moments where the <unk> was almost <unk>, OK?
So, he was <unk> home and he was looking at the <unk> and the <unk> through, and he <unk> a <unk> just in the <unk>, and he was, and he said, which was like if you <unk> with the other hand and <unk>.
He <unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk>, but at the <unk>, the <unk> word to the first one.
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not all my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; it <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work on the <unk>.
But even I, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I think that's a lot of you <unk> the <unk>.
You know, even though the work and the ideas <unk> me to a certain source I couldn't <unk> <unk>.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it to it not to be <unk> your head, but, what's <unk> us?
And as I'm about, the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I've <unk> different years ago for a <unk>.
<unk> of this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life has been the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk>, trying to control, <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, these species of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then <unk>, <unk>, and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk>, <unk> all for him.
<unk> <unk> and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk>, which comes in his head as <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, but it doesn't know how to <unk>.
It has no <unk>, it has no <unk>, it has no <unk>, it has no <unk>.
So it starts to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> <unk> in him, "I'm going to lose, and <unk> <unk> from this song song.
I'm not enough <unk> and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of going to go to the <unk>, they <unk>.
<unk> the whole process <unk> and <unk> something completely new.
He just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>," You can't see I'm <unk>? "
"You know, what can you write a song now?
If you really want to <unk>, you'll <unk> it in a more <unk> moment when I can take care of you.
<unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his process <unk> <unk> <unk> after this.
Not the work, the work was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when <unk>, the <unk> that the <unk>, the <unk> that the <unk> would not be a <unk> thing and <unk> it back from where, <unk> was, which was not to be a <unk> thing and <unk>.
but <unk> this <unk>, <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing and <unk> and <unk>, but it wasn't <unk>.
So, how we <unk> that story to change a little bit of the way I <unk> that I <unk> and already <unk> me once.
This idea, I <unk> me when I was <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and I <unk> in one of the <unk> that we all have on something and we can't think that's going to be a <unk>, which will be the book.
Not just <unk>, just <unk>, just the book <unk> written.
And we started thinking about this project.
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> the air and <unk> us.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room.
And I said to <unk>, "<unk>," What, "<unk>," What, "<unk> is not going to be <unk> my, right?
Because as you see I'm <unk> what I have, I don't have to do this.
So if you want you to <unk> and do your side and do your part of it.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what, you know, you know, nothing.
I started writing the same because it's my work.
And I'd like to be <unk> that I'm <unk> to do my part of "because -- at the end is so, OK -- <unk> -- it's the end of the <unk> of the moon, <unk> music that <unk> <unk>, and <unk> music that <unk> on the <unk> of the moon, and <unk>, to the <unk> of the moon, and <unk> hours to the <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk>.
But every single single single <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know what I'm talking about, because I know what you've seen, at a certain point, a <unk> like this.
It was like if the time <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was not doing anything else, like the <unk> <unk> before, but all all <unk>.
And suddenly, you don't just <unk> as a human.
But they <unk> from <unk> and <unk> under the <unk> of the <unk>.
And when this <unk>, people <unk> what was, the people <unk> what was, he <unk> it with his name.
<unk> your hands and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God,"
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which you can still feel in the <unk> or in <unk>.
In <unk>, when a artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's <unk> because we need.
But the problem comes the problem, for the <unk>, when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of God is not <unk>.
It's just a <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, and maybe you never <unk> to <unk> that <unk>.
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still as <unk>, and what does it have to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you're not <unk>, <unk>, which the most <unk> of your being being being being from you.
But let me just show you that data in <unk> from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to move to the other when you finished.
And, you know, if we think of this way it changes.
And so I started <unk>, and it's certainly like I <unk> it for different months during the <unk> of the book that I was going to <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> of my success success.
And what I have to go to <unk> when I feel like I'm <unk> from this is, I don't fear.
You don't know. You just <unk> your job.
<unk> to <unk> your hand, any can be.
If your job is <unk>, you know, you know, you know, if you're <unk>.
If the <unk>, you're <unk> <unk> to you <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for one moment through your <unk>, then, "<unk>!"
<unk>, you do the same your <unk>.
And <unk>! "<unk>!" <unk>! "
I think, and I think <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>, just for having <unk> love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
As you know, I've talked about some of these projects on the human genome, what can <unk> and the discovery of new <unk> of genes.
We're <unk> a new <unk> <unk>, and we started <unk> biology and now start <unk> the digital code, we're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always tried to make great <unk> of <unk>.
"<unk> is the life?" It's something that many <unk> have to understand how many levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> terms.
We're <unk> from almost 20 years now.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology to the digital world of the <unk> of the computer biology world.
Now, we <unk> the life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the <unk> species from the <unk> genome of the <unk> genome of the <unk> of the <unk> that can <unk> in the lab.
And we tried to <unk> <unk> the genome to <unk> one even smaller.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at its map <unk>, it's just <unk> than our.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all genes that we can <unk>, one at the time, it's very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell.
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of the <unk>. "We can <unk> a <unk>?"
Can the chemistry <unk> of produce these great molecules that we never have been able to create the first time of them?
And in case, <unk>, can we make a <unk>?
<unk> is just a <unk> of <unk> <unk> material.
The speed with which we are <unk> to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
Our ability to write the code, instead, rather slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We <unk> more than 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the experiments.
But we found that <unk> of DNA is very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that are <unk> little <unk> of DNA, <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and it is a <unk> process. The <unk> is a long <unk>, the <unk> is, more <unk>, there are.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, <unk> from <unk> information of the genome of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a little <unk> <unk> <unk> bacteria.
We designed the <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material <unk> and we <unk> it in bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> particles are <unk> by cells, they're <unk> by <unk>, and they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I talked about the recent <unk> industry that they've certainly <unk> this model.
They have more than you.
<unk> that's a situation where the software can actually build his same <unk> in a <unk> system.
But we could do the largest things in the big.
We could build the whole <unk> of the <unk>.
They are more than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> code.
So we thought of <unk> in the size of the virus, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell.
<unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> information with <unk> information in a computer, these must be very <unk>.
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We found, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If you <unk> that original <unk> sequence never <unk> that original <unk> <unk> ever <unk>.
A part of the process is design <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 to build <unk> <unk> to build <unk> <unk> <unk> to build <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> here.
You've probably read that that <unk> us about the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: We have a <unk> code <unk> on four <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> together about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk>.
So we can use the code for writing words, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did is the beginning is <unk>.
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> with <unk> <unk> from five to seven <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them to them, and they <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But every step, we have <unk> these <unk> in <unk> so that we're <unk> to create a extremely <unk> <unk> as you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this looks like the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
When we <unk> these <unk> <unk>, we're <unk>, more than 100 <unk> <unk>, you're not going to be <unk> <unk>.
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> biology.
So we <unk> other <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA <unk> that we can <unk> the <unk>.
Here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And in 12 -- 24 hours, it's <unk> exactly like it was before.
<unk> of thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can <unk>.
We're going to live under <unk>.
They're absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and they <unk> to find new <unk> of water.
It's true, NASA showed that this happens.
This is an <unk> image of the <unk> we built using these <unk>, just using the <unk> with the <unk> with the <unk> design of <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> them.
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> so big we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are <unk> <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> we did a little time ago.
They are more than <unk> <unk> code.
It's the largest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> structure that's ever <unk> by the man.
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> to 300 million.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk>, you'll just <unk> pages to <unk> this code.
Now, how do we do it work?
Of course, with a <unk> virus is a <unk> game.
It's a little more <unk> when you use bacteria.
It's <unk>, even when it's about <unk> cells like our: you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is basically the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> is instead of <unk> into the cell, but we <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> cell from one to another and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a kind of <unk>.
The two are the <unk> of the <unk> men.
We <unk> some <unk> in the <unk> way that you can decide what to <unk> for this <unk>.
He <unk> it with the <unk> <unk> in a way to <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went to the cell.
And we <unk> that we didn't go beyond, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the <unk> <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> <unk> from some <unk>, <unk> in a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> of the species.
So who think about evolution as a <unk> <unk> at the time, you know, you know, the <unk> of biology.
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that was in the cell cell didn't have one.
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it has.
And it's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> it, and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk>.
It's become blue because of the genes we have <unk>.
And in a short <unk> of time, all the <unk> of a species are <unk>, and you <unk> the <unk>, and you <unk> the <unk> of all in a new species, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, the <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the code that we have <unk>.
Now, this may seem <unk> <unk>, but we <unk> the software, we can change the things in a enough <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that you don't talk about <unk> -- but in <unk> <unk> -- but in the <unk> of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> in which we <unk> <unk> <unk> new species on this process.
Why do that?
I think it's enough to <unk> our <unk>.
We're going to go from six billion and a half in the next 40 years.
<unk> for example, I was born in <unk>.
Now, there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk>; in 40 years, there will be four years.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, water and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> for six billion people.
We're more <unk> to do it for nine billion.
<unk> than five billion <unk>, more than 30 billion <unk> <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it will be a huge challenge.
And we have to realize the whole <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere.
And so on the <unk> <unk> in the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes of genes, and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry only one <unk> about <unk>, and think of how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from the <unk> reality and from our imagination.
Now we have <unk>, because of these <unk> <unk> <unk>, that can create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We can make a big robot that can produce a <unk> robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think of these 20 million genes or try to try to <unk> the <unk> to make <unk> or <unk>, <unk>, we can change, because of a little team, and create more <unk> biology that we can change, because of science.
And it's just a standard <unk>.
We can choose to <unk> <unk>, chemistry or <unk>, <unk> <unk>,
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how they're going to be.
We know exactly what their code is.
Now we're going to <unk> the <unk> of <unk>.
You've also seen you who <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We <unk> <unk> <unk> as the <unk> <unk> as soon as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter, so that we're working on to design cells that can reach to design cells that can reach reach this, and we think that we can get the first <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the food of the <unk> of the cost of the cost of food cost of food and
The <unk> light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> but in our <unk> <unk> in our <unk> in the world, we've found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the ocean, about <unk> feet <unk> <unk> <unk> of the water.
They <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2, which can easily be <unk> through <unk>, <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So, I think a little bit of <unk>, we might be able to <unk> what the <unk> is to be. "We, we <unk> the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it?
It's a main source of energy.
<unk>, we're working for the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we're always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it's about finding the right.
I think what you can change <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Here's how the future could start to look <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the <unk> with bacteria <unk>, <unk>, and then then <unk> cells.
We are so <unk> people.
Our purpose is to make enough to live enough to try to try to <unk> <unk>. Thank you very much.
<unk> of all, I'm going to show you, the <unk> <unk>, some <unk> work, a new technology, which we brought to the <unk> <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago. This is <unk>.
This is a <unk> environment that you can <unk> is to local level that <unk> with an enormous amount of <unk> data.
Here we are seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a <unk> <unk>, <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big it is the amount of information that we see, how big are these <unk> of data or images.
Most of them are common <unk>, but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that you <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any moment. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, example of data, not of images.
This is the <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
And so we think that's just about the <unk> and not of images, we can do a <unk> thing, to see that it's a real <unk> <unk>, not of a <unk>, not of a picture.
It may be a <unk> way to read a <unk> book.
I don't tell you.
This is a <unk> example. It's a <unk> number of <unk>.
Every picture is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it gives you a really pleasure and the experience of read the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk> of a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
We also did something with the <unk> of this particular number of the <unk> of the <unk>.
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> than what you use in a normal <unk> <unk> and we <unk> you <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or another models, or even <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
And I thought this <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> <unk>, not <unk> to be <unk>.
Of course, the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this this field, I don't want to say we have <unk> from <unk> to <unk> that.
These are all the <unk> in the United States <unk> above a NASA <unk> picture of NASA.
So now I'm going to do something else.
This is actually live on the Web; you can <unk>.
This is a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a very interesting research computer computer computer computer <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive on the Web, <unk> by <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, which we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience to <unk> <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here is actually.
The <unk> of <unk> computers have <unk> these images together, so that they <unk> to the <unk> places that <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk>. So, you see the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>, and these things are all <unk> on the <unk> <unk>, and these are all <unk> to <unk>, and these are all <unk> on the <unk> level.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some more <unk>.
I want to go to one of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we have done for the first time, I'm going to show you what we really do is the key to the behind this technology, the technology, the <unk> technology, the <unk> technology, and it's not <unk> as <unk>.
We had to <unk> some <unk> and forth.
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of kinds of <unk>, and <unk> images of kinds of <unk> and forth. And so on. And so, we <unk> these <unk> <unk> a picture is discovery to this model.
So, they're all <unk> images and have been all <unk> on the <unk> level in this way.
And it's possible to <unk> this way.
You know, I would never have thought of going to work for <unk>.
It's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think we're going to see that it's a lot of different kinds of <unk>: from those <unk> cell phones, <unk> <unk>, a number of <unk>, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can, I can try to look at those <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, etc.
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment.
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now <unk> data from the whole <unk> of how to <unk> the land, from the <unk>, from the point of view, and <unk> all that data together.
All those <unk> are <unk> together, more than the <unk>.
You have a model of the entire <unk> <unk>.
Think about this as the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on Earth.
It's something that <unk> in complexity as people <unk> the <unk>, and the <unk> of the <unk> of the use.
Their <unk> are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If someone comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk>, the name, my <unk> picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of all those data, and I can use the <unk> <unk> of all those data, and I can use the <unk> of <unk> in that space, and you can have a social experience of <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of all that are <unk> models of every interesting part of the land, <unk>, not just from <unk> <unk> and from <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, but from <unk> memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized? What do you know? What your software <unk> us to do is that at a certain point, in the next years, all the photographs of them are going to be <unk> together?
<unk>: Yeah. What's doing is basically, it's <unk>.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's doing it in the <unk> of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think of the <unk> information that a lot of these <unk> images.
As you do a research of images on the Web, you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> page, and the <unk> on the <unk> of the picture.
Now, what's going on if that picture you're <unk> to all your picture?
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's a huge <unk> effect. It's a <unk> effect of the network.
CA: <unk>, it's really incredible. <unk>.
<unk>: I'm going to tell you a lot.
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that that we can live in the <unk> of the <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>, the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>, the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of plants.
<unk> to think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk>, or <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the idea that the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and the idea that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and the idea that the idea of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk>,, and that <unk> <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done, well or evil, many <unk>.
And, of course, all of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>. <unk>.
We're <unk> <unk>.
We have to deal with the <unk> of death, so we don't have to <unk> if you <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of the song, the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they're <unk> <unk> of the <unk>, or the <unk> <unk> of <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, or <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>.
He was my <unk> of the journey in <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, on the <unk>, the <unk> mother's mother's <unk>.
All of these <unk> us that are other ways of <unk> that there are other ways of thinking, other ways to move in the world.
And if you <unk> a second, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of <unk> world create a <unk> of life and <unk> and <unk> the planet and it's important for the <unk> of the planet, as the <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk>.
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> of all the <unk>, of all the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, being <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, being <unk> by being by the human imagination.
<unk> is the <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be in how <unk> species.
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all the species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk> because it's <unk>, or <unk> -- in the <unk> of the <unk> diversity -- and you don't even even <unk> to the <unk> <unk> -- that's not <unk> <unk> -- that's <unk> diversity.
The <unk> of all of that is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A <unk> language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules.
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the middle of which the <unk> of every culture comes in the world.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we're sitting in <unk>, at least half not more <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They're not <unk> to children, which means, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which are <unk>.
What's more <unk> than being <unk> by the <unk>, of being the last to talk about a language, of the <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the children?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in the world of every two weeks, every two weeks, <unk> <unk> and <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know that someone of you say, "It's not that?
The world would not be a better place if we could <unk> all the same language? "<unk>, then we're talking to all the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> what means means to say, not you can't talk their language.
I'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Most of us <unk> that when I say, "I mean," I really mean, I really mean different ways of <unk>.
<unk> for example, this <unk> <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, which <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that that's not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the forest, which <unk> the <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule, <unk> <unk>, "You have to <unk> a person <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
All that has <unk> in the past <unk>, but the <unk> is that in these families in which they talk to six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> nobody <unk> a language.
You're <unk> to listen and then you're going to talk.
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I've lived, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, an incredible <unk> that has the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
They did <unk> from the <unk> <unk> that <unk> them in <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> forest <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> forest <unk> <unk> had never seen anything.
They <unk> the <unk> from the ground, they <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> and, not <unk>, they <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk>.
But <unk> not only <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> between them.
<unk> percent of the <unk> <unk> was <unk> by their own.
We're <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two cases of death, and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was so <unk>, and then they <unk> it. And then they <unk> it the same. "But it's <unk>, they <unk> it.
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species.
<unk> years early '<unk>, I was <unk> a very interesting task when my <unk> <unk>, if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>
To give a sense of <unk>, I should understand the <unk> culture and the <unk> is not <unk> <unk>.
It's quite a <unk> <unk> <unk> vision of the world.
<unk> <unk>.
If you ask you to <unk> the <unk> of the world, what do you <unk>?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
<unk> is always <unk> out, thinking that Africa <unk> didn't have <unk> <unk> <unk>. And instead of <unk> is not else that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> relationship between life and death.
So <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the live in the <unk> of the live in the <unk>.
And this <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk>, "God.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And since the moment you're <unk>, is the spirit that you can <unk> you, how do you <unk>?
So, they <unk> to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of the mind when it <unk> in a <unk> <unk>.
We all the <unk> with which I've lived the most <unk> <unk> are the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of the <unk> civilization <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a <unk> continent of blood, this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk>.
<unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> but their <unk> is extraordinary.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> from <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> or four years, and live in a <unk> world <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years.
Two years <unk> of nine years <unk> of the way to <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
And all of this time, they're <unk> to the values of their society, values that <unk> their <unk> and just their <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk>.
And the <unk> of this incredible <unk>, they <unk> out and for the first time in their life, they see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> the <unk> of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, all that they've learned in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, all of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, and it says,
"<unk>?" <unk> like I said.
It's <unk>. Now, it's <unk>.
They call <unk> <unk> and say that we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world.
This level of <unk> is extremely important.
When we think of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the old <unk> of <unk>, which is a <unk> <unk> in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and we say that these are <unk> <unk> to the Earth.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> <unk>.
There's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk>, but because of the time and <unk>, have created a <unk> of the Earth's <unk>. It's not <unk> <unk> <unk>. But on a <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the Earth can live only because it's <unk> from human human <unk>.
What does that mean?
<unk> to say that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a <unk> <unk>. <unk> the <unk> is going to be a <unk> human being <unk>. It's going to be <unk> different with the mountain or that, as a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> a mountain of <unk>, and it's a <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
<unk> is the <unk> of one or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
And that <unk> me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> that <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
If we <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different <unk>, we start to understand some of them <unk>. They <unk> this <unk>.
I <unk> this picture of <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> of the <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk> two elements.
<unk> one side, this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a little <unk> that <unk>, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> has <unk> <unk>, very similar to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you're going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that make it a different <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. [<unk>].] [<unk>].] [<unk>] of the reality of the reality of the reality.
I often <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
My <unk> <unk>, you can't <unk> these <unk> as you're <unk> because if you've done not <unk> to be <unk>. [[<unk>], but they can't be <unk> because they're <unk> by a <unk> that's <unk>, because they're <unk> by a <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> <unk> <unk>. If you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk>.
Now, the <unk>: the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> <unk>, the same <unk> <unk>, the same <unk> to <unk> the <unk>. The question is <unk> <unk>: in a <unk> <unk> of plants, how do these <unk> to <unk> two <unk>, but that they create these <unk> to <unk> two <unk> <unk>, but if you <unk> in this way, create a <unk> version of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if you look at the <unk>, we <unk>, "<unk> <unk> us."
What does that mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes <unk> in the <unk> same species.
If you <unk> their <unk> <unk>, you know, you know, you know, you don't know everything? "I said," "No."
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> <unk> in a night of moon, and <unk> with a different <unk>.
And so, you don't have to <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk> <unk>.
Now, [[<unk>] the problem is that they also have to the <unk> <unk> <unk>, but in some way to the <unk> of the history of our real world, and beyond.
In fact, the <unk> century, in 300 years, not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk>, but rather like it was where we <unk> and we <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> diversity and <unk> of the planet. Now the problem is not. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through the <unk> are <unk> in a <unk> to new <unk> of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk>, like <unk>, they don't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put from <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the <unk> or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And if you look at a look at the world, I'm not <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They are <unk> and <unk> <unk> out of the existence of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has lived in the forest to a generation ago, and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
We started <unk> with the <unk> <unk> with the forest <unk>.
Or, in the case of <unk>, are diseases that are <unk> with the discovery of the <unk> discovery of <unk>.
If you <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> politics.
As <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> physics of a <unk>, is <unk> <unk> at the <unk> <unk>, but the <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, not just <unk>, but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's part of the development.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> until you're not part of the beginning.
I <unk> the <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> with a young <unk>, but just <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but just <unk> to <unk>, I realized what's behind.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The one means that it's been <unk> to the Chinese <unk> of the Chinese <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that brought the <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was being <unk>.
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at the age of two years <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn't have no <unk> of him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and this <unk>, it was <unk> to the <unk> work for seven years.
The pain of <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> <unk> <unk> is from <unk> <unk>.
And then, all you <unk> to a choice.
How do we live in the <unk> world of <unk> or we want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk>, before he died, he said that his greatest fear was that, in our <unk> to this <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world, not just <unk> the whole <unk> of the human imagination, but one day, we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, which has given us agriculture, which has <unk> us to the <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, by the <unk> of the <unk>, creating the <unk> of the <unk>, creating the <unk> of the <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And so I didn't know, I didn't tell me that we have the answers to the challenges that we can <unk>.
When these <unk> of <unk> the world's <unk>, what they say to be human, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the chance to be what we are: sort of <unk> species, that's to make all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there are great moments of <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and this man, <unk> me, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The <unk> government has not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the '<unk> and in the' <unk> to <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, and all of his <unk>.
You know that <unk> don't <unk> the cold, the <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> fish <unk> in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> <unk> by night or <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> away, you know, you <unk> the <unk> in your hand. When I did the <unk>, they <unk> it, he <unk> it, he <unk> it by <unk>, he <unk> it by <unk>, it <unk> it by <unk>,
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk>, and when <unk> <unk>, <unk> a dog <unk>.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created a <unk>, has <unk> another dog and <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> to talk about <unk>? [[<unk>]. This, in different ways, [<unk>] is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> government <unk> the <unk> government <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of an area of <unk> <unk> <unk> of a bigger <unk> of California and <unk>.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. We <unk> all the <unk> resources.
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, to end, I think it's rather <unk> at least at the <unk> of us, the <unk> <unk> that are not at all.
For someone is home.
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of these children, like the dreams of our children, as the dreams of hope.
To end, we <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything.
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> are not <unk>, but we think stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public in places to <unk> <unk> from which <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which they <unk> from what they <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and we have to find a <unk> <unk> life in the diversity, and we have to find a <unk> life in a world and <unk>. We have to find a <unk> world of life in a <unk> world.
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book I hope to <unk> other you've already heard and <unk> to some <unk>, in the case, not <unk> them.
I'd like to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk>."
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all the society <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>: If we we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens, "The way to do it is <unk> the <unk> <unk>."
The reason is, on one side, in the fact that the freedom is <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for humans.
<unk> is in the fact that if we are <unk>, each of us can act to be <unk> to do everything that we <unk> our <unk>, without any one that <unk> in our name.
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk>.
<unk> people have, more <unk>, and more, they are their <unk>, and more than their <unk>, is their <unk>.
This, <unk>, it's so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> <unk> to <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly great.
I'm going to give me a simple <unk> on the <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for you a huge number of <unk> in <unk> <unk> that nobody of <unk> <unk> <unk> is to your <unk>.
Here's what <unk> is.
Then you go to the <unk> store to buy a <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> store, there's a big number of <unk> <unk>.
We can make six million of different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a <unk>.
<unk> <unk> that is <unk>.
<unk> fields: the world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a child, you could get all the <unk> services, <unk> <unk>, <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk>.
You <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
One of that, in the other, was that the phone <unk> <unk>.
These times, they've gone.
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk>, especially between cell cell.
Here's the future cell.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you don't have it yet seen in the <unk> <unk>, you're going to be <unk>.
And what is the end of the end is that people <unk> to the <unk> and it's the answer? And the answer is, "
It's not possible to buy a cell cell that doesn't make things.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk>, <unk> the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>, not happens in the United States that you're going to be <unk> and the <unk> you what you have to do.
Instead, <unk> from <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk> "<unk>" has these <unk> and these <unk>. What do you want to do? "
You know, you know, what do you do? "
And the <unk> says, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you say, "<unk> if she was me, what do you know?"
And the <unk>: "But I'm not her."
The <unk> <unk> we call "<unk> <unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk> <unk> it makes it look like a <unk> thing.
But actually it's not that a <unk> <unk> the weight and the responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something, <unk> the <unk>, to <unk> the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and it's not <unk> -- and so it's not <unk> -- and so not in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk> products, <unk> people like me and you, that if you think about it has no sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk> them?
The answer is that they want to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
And so the <unk> of how we are our <unk> <unk> is a question of choice, how you see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> the children. We don't <unk> a <unk>: we have to <unk> the <unk>.
And we can <unk> them.
The <unk> means that every <unk>, you have to decide that kind of person being.
<unk> to the family and <unk>, a <unk> time the common perspective, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> to anyone, was <unk> the <unk> as possible possible, and they <unk> to make children the <unk> as possible possible.
The only real choice was with who, not when, and that's not when, and what they did after.
<unk>, all it's really to play.
They're going to be <unk>, and they <unk> their 20 percent in less than a time.
And not because they're not <unk> <unk>, not because they're less <unk>.
But why I'm <unk>, I'm going to <unk>, "<unk> or not?"
"<unk> <unk> later? I have to think about the children or to the career?"
They are <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even though this <unk>, if this <unk> didn't <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk>.
And they really have to do it. They're important questions.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, like <unk> <unk>, because the technology <unk> us, every day, from every day of the planet, <unk> that's <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I don't know what the <unk> works.
I don't tell you, because I want to use it.
What does, this incredible freedom to be about the work? Is that we have to <unk>, <unk> every moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son to <unk>, with the <unk> in a <unk>, the <unk> in the other, and the <unk>, <unk>, on <unk>.
And if I'm all <unk>, if I'm all <unk>, we see our son, we're also <unk>, "I have to answer this called"? "
"I have to answer this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And when the answer is, "no, all of this makes the experience of your son very different from what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of us, we look, little, things and <unk>, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some <unk>, but it wasn't a question of choice.
The world of today is <unk> to this: <unk> is, "It's a <unk> thing, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> we know, we all, so I'm going to talk about <unk>.
We <unk> this choice <unk> two <unk> actually <unk> people on.
The first one, <unk>, is that it <unk> instead of <unk>.
<unk> many <unk> of which you choose, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I'll give you an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
My <unk> has had access to the <unk> data, the <unk> society of <unk> <unk>, with about a million <unk> <unk> in different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 <unk> that are <unk> in more, the <unk> <unk> <unk> of two percent.
<unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent <unk>, is 10 percent in less than when they're <unk> <unk>.
Because with 50 <unk> between which you choose, is <unk> difficult to decide, and the choice is <unk>.
And in <unk>, and still <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk>, <unk>, you can't ever get.
<unk> that doesn't mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they're not going to have enough money, you want to say that the decision is so <unk> that we also <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the work of <unk>.
They're not <unk>, they're <unk> to five <unk> <unk> for the year from <unk> of work, which would be <unk> to <unk>.
So, <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices.
And I think we <unk> the world like this.
"And finally, for the <unk>: <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
You know, you know, if it's for <unk>, you know?
You don't want to choose the wrong wrong, and you <unk> the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that we also have to <unk> the <unk> and make a choice, at the end, we're less <unk> by the <unk> of how <unk> states with less <unk> between which you have.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with many <unk> between which you choose, if you <unk> one and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that they could make a different choice that would have been better. And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> about choice, and the <unk> <unk> from the decision.
And when it was a <unk> decision.
<unk> choices, you have, it's <unk> to any <unk> that's <unk> of <unk>.
<unk>, there's what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well as the value that we give the <unk> things from.
<unk>, when you have a lot of <unk>, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and be <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
Here's an example. I'm <unk> with all of New York.
But that's what you probably <unk>.
There's this <unk> to the <unk>.
<unk> place.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all for them.
They don't know. But what he thinks is, "Well, <unk>, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> to <unk> are <unk>."
"<unk> <unk> just in front of the house."
And it's two weeks from the idea that's <unk> -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where it wants.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have, when the choice was <unk>.
And the <unk> are the <unk> we have from <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about the moment, and maybe the <unk> of slowly.
But the most important is that anything you're <unk>, you're not going to be the other.
The things that we don't have many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new <unk> of <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk>.
Once the <unk> were just like, <unk> them and <unk> them from <unk>, they were <unk>, only after <unk> <unk>, they were <unk>, only after <unk> <unk> a <unk> life, they would be good.
So, I started <unk> a couple of <unk>, when the <unk> were gone, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
<unk> told me, "Do you want to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
Do you want them to <unk> or with <unk>? "
"Do you want them to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --" <unk> <unk> <unk> -- "<unk> to <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little <unk> I was able to say, "I want the guy who was the only guy," I'm the only guy, so I'm <unk>, and then <unk> from the <unk>, and then I <unk> from the <unk>, and then I <unk> from the <unk>, and then I was <unk> from the <unk>, and then I was <unk>, with the best of the best <unk> of <unk> I ever had ever had.
It was the <unk>. And so, I had <unk> the best.
But I'm <unk> worse.
Why? I wrote a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
And I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't know anything about <unk> when I just had a <unk>, but when we <unk> 100 different, <unk>, at least one kind had to be perfect.
What I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After I <unk> that I was <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people don't do that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the same.
And this <unk> <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk>, if you realize it.
Because if I <unk> it, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth <unk> to this.
"You know, when you were worse," The reason why he was <unk> when he was worse, when he was worse than he was <unk> as possible to <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world that we live in -- <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that the things are <unk> to be <unk>.
You've never <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you are here -- is, "<unk> <unk>," Yes, "you want to do it."
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- which I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I didn't have <unk>.
But <unk> is not always a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> when you're not just that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you say, "Why?"
Who is <unk>? "The answer is <unk>.
The world is the <unk>. What could I do?
When you have hundreds of <unk>, and you <unk> a <unk>, and you <unk>, and you <unk>, who is <unk> <unk>, which <unk> you are you.
They could do better.
And with hundreds of <unk> <unk>, there are not <unk> for <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even if the result is <unk>, they <unk> and <unk>, and they <unk> their own.
In the last years, the <unk> world is <unk>.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have <unk> experiences because the standard are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation that <unk> is they think that <unk> is them.
So the final result is that we're better, <unk>, but we're going to <unk> us.
Let me tell you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we all do for them, and it's completely <unk>. It's not true.
There's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is not <unk> at all, but it doesn't <unk> any any choice is better than a little bit.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we've <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices are going to be our life.
Now, from the point of view <unk> -- I've almost finished -- from the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> is the <unk>.
What makes all this choice in society <unk> is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you know, <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not that they have <unk>.
The problem is that they have too <unk>.
So the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> society.
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> you talked about yesterday of how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to be <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean, these choices, <unk> and <unk>, it's not that they're just <unk>.
They are <unk> <unk>.
They do worse.
If a little bit of what we in our society <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> in the people have too few possibilities, it would not just their life to be <unk>, but also our <unk>.
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of the income <unk> of all -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk>.
And so, "<unk>, you can become what you want to --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>, "But what do you do that fish?"
"It's <unk> that you can't make anything in a <unk> of glass."
"A <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> vision of the world --
and I <unk> it so, I <unk> it.
But then, <unk>, I realized that the <unk> knows that fish knows.
Because the reality is that if you <unk> in <unk> the <unk>, so that you can't <unk> the <unk>, so that you can't <unk> the freedom. You <unk> the <unk>.
If you <unk> the <unk> that we could <unk> the <unk> that you can <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> the <unk>, and <unk> the <unk>.
They all need a <unk>.
This is almost <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly <unk> for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you.
