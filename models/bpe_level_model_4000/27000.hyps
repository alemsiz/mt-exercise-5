Last year, I showed these slides to show that the calculation that the calculum glacial calot, which for almost three million years has been the size of the 48 United States, it reverted 40 percent.
But this undervalue of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice.
The artickle calculation is, in a way, the heart of the climate system of the climate system
You expand in the summer and return it into the summer.
The next slide is going to be a rapidly fast on the last 25 years.
The lost glaciers are signed in red in the red.
As you see, they expand it up to the blue Europe and blue --
That's the ice in the winter that reports of the summer.
You can see the so-called the lost ice ice ice ice ice ice ice ice ice here is like the blood here -- which was from the body.
In 25 years of this is spent from this.
This is a problem because the extreme is a very constantly of the artic ocean around the artic ocean where there are huge carbon congelted that you will grow from the microbes.
To explain the total invitation of the global warming, that amount could double, that amount could double, superthat point of not return.
In some deep in Alaska in Alaska is already rebolling from water.
The professorse Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was removed with a team -- baskleat the last inver.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: You're good. The question is if we are also going to be us.
A reason is that this term exchanging the Greenland from the north.
This is a glacial record of glacial record.
The brought has never reached levels.
This is the Kangerlussuaq, in the southern of the Groenland, in the south.
If you want to know how the sea level of sea ice to the sell of the sea.
These currents are increasing rapidly.
On the other side of the planet: Antarctices, the largest block of the planet.
The last month of the scientists have said that the ice of the ice is negative, and that the Western Antarctica, which is particularly quickly in some submarine, is particularly quickly in the sheet sheet.
And it was six meters of water, like in Groenland, like in Groenland,
Himalaya, the third largest block over ice, you see new laghi, you see a few years ago were glaciers.
40 percent of the world's population reception,
His Ande: this glacier is the source of the water water water water from this city.
The brought is increased.
But when it decredit it, the same happens.
In California snow on Sierra Nevada is 40-percent.
Midries are in crisis.
Spraise -- as you read, are grave.
The growing security in the world leads to a firemarkable increases of prevents.
The environmental disastery is increasing a rhythm and without previous precedented it.
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years that respect to the previous 75.
This is a whole bunch of all insustainable.
If you look at it in the history context if you can see the consequences of it.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the area of the Pacific, from Amer, and in both Amer, and on both the parts of the subject continent -- where there's a radical oxygen oxygen in the oceans.
The most causes of global warming, together to deforestation, which is 20 percent, is the use of fuel fuels.
Oil's a problem, and carbon is even worse is even worse
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions, with China.
And he proposed to build a lot of carbon central carbon on on carbon.
But we're assisting to a direction.
These are the projects that are annulled in the last few years and some proposal of grees.
Each way, there's a political lots in our country.
The carbon industries and oil industry has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon to promotion carbon on oxymore.
That image I reminded me to something,
Verysal, in Tennessee, where I live, there's been a loss of 3.8 billion gallons of carbon dixiety dies.
Maybe you saw it on the news of the news.
This is the second biggest flow of scale in America.
It was happened around Natal.
The natalization commercial publishing industry.
Video: Frosty the carbon is a kind of hallegry and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is more and more and more and more and more cleaner.
It's a good price, adorable and the workers are maining the church.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of carbon West Virginia.
The biggest society about mountains is Massey Coal. This is his friend's greatest friend.
Video: Don Blankenship: I'm clearly clear -- Al Gore, Nancy Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for Clima Proteation of Clima has been launched two campaigns.
This is a bunch of it, a party.
Video: Ate: Ate: At COALergives see the climate changes like a serious seria to our business business --
For this is to invest a big amount of money in a switch in a sweet to make public and consumption and for conventure.
In fact, carbon is not sport.
We think it's cleaned -- has a good profume.
So not predicted about climate change.
Let me do us.
Video: Attore: Carbon pulipped -- you heard a lot of it.
So let's do it a framework in a framework for how it is a cleaning coal of the carbon --
Straordinary! The machines are a little noise, but this is the sound of the carbon technology of the cleaner.
The carbon consumers is between the main cause, but the remarkable causes of carbon remarkable causes that you can see it changes everything.
Take a look at the hat. This is the odiernice technology.
Al Gore: First, the positive alternative to the economic issues to the economic and the national security.
Video: Comment: America's economy, the economy, the national security crisis.
The file that lines all the is: our dependence from fossil fuels -- like the sports and oil oil oil and imported --
Now, yet, there's a new solution to use solution for circles.
Rear America: 100-clean energy in 10 years.
A plan to re-America's work, make us certainly safe, and help to stop the global warming.
Finally, a solution that you basts to solve our problems.
Rear America. Sweird of them.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: It's about reeug: It's about reebuying to America.
One of the fastest ways of bring to the dependence from combuster combuster that we kills our planet.
Comparsa: The future is here. Vently, sole, a new network net.
It is number number of two: Novi investments for very good jobs.
Comment: Rear America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A proverbial proverbio African says, "If you want to go to speed --
If you want to go away together."
We need to go away fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED I did a LHC.
And I promises to updating you to update you to update it to the machine.
So here I am here -- for those that the other time we don't have her, the LHC is is the biggest scientific experiment that you ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circle.
His compit is to reach the conditions that were fewer than a billion billion of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
This is just the environment.
This is the machine machine in the Ginever.
We Fotographic Big Bang in the relevel.
This is what I work. It's called AS -- it's largege-like like 4-meters and has a 2-meters feet and has a 2-meters.
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in built so you can see the proportions.
Ten secember 10 secember we have accurate the machine for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immened immense in control.
It's a picture of the first particles in the LHC, and by collision, as a LHC, entering into collision, with a part of the LHC, and spread particles inside the relevel.
In other words, when we saw that picture the 10 secember, we knew that the machine works, which is a great living.
I don't know if it was going to exact more open, and that when somebody went on Google and vide that the page was the beginning was this.
That means that we have a cultural impact beyond in the scientific impact on the scientific impact of that is that we had a cultural impact beyond in the scientific impact of the scientific impact beyond the scientific impact of that is that we had a cultural impact over to the scientific impact of the scientific impact of that means we have a cultural impact of cultural scientific impact
About a week, there was a problem with the machine, had to these movies here -- these doryes.
These files take 13,000 printing when the machine is the massive power of potence.
Now, the technicians between you and they will look at the movies and say, "That's not true. It's not true. It's not true. It's not true.
And they can do it because when they're very cold, they become the so-called files.
So, at least 271 degrees, at least 271 degrees that of the space between the stars, these files can bring that current.
In one of the junctures in the LHC, there was a fabrication. There was a fabrication.
So the files are going to read reading and 13,000 printing suddenly met a sudden resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive if you think these magnetic fish about 20 tons in it, and that have been moved about 30 centimeters.
They sneat about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to take them to the thing that we did.
We have repristined them and upside and updying them.
Now they're return all back to their place.
By the end of the LHC is will be new inteer.
We accenciate it, and we expect to get the right data to jugment or him, and continue so our adventure to discover what the morning is the morning that universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these framatic accidents return the debate on the value of science and engineering the values of science and engineering in front of it.
I think the fact that it's so hard to go over the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I want to end with the words of a scientist scientist Humphrey Davy, the guy, the image, in defense of the experiment in his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, and his pupill, "No is that a lot of dangerous human mind that is not about the degree as the requires of human definition, which is not new warming for nature, which is not not new warming new worlds, and that our triumph,
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about how children, you play in the morning --
As you understand how to get them and make them achieving, and they move them, and you learn them to think and solve it and resolve them and make it so that we can get to the space problems.
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us.
So, from informath inspired by the useful of our interaction with physical objects, with my Patti, and my collaborator Jevan Kalanithi, I started asking -- and I started asking "And if we use a computer -- instead of having the mouse of the mouse as a computer polymouse polypage that you die to a desktop, we can make sure information with entretaxive information with ently a information with entries to reverse to the sent polymp to be able to be to be
and we have it to our pleasure,
The question was so interesting that we decided to exploring the answer, building the answer, building the Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable computer.
In a few words, a Siftable computer.
You can move with the hand the hand they can see their movement and they can see their movement and a wireless radio wireless.
But especially are objects, as physics, as the morning morning, you can move it simply afferrand.
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem for a new tools to manipulate information to manipulate the digital information
And as they become more physics, you know, you know about the movement, others, and as they become more physics, and as they become more physicists, and as they die -- how we move them to move them to the fun and funny stills style plants.
I'm going to start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is configured to show the vide: if you include it it in a direction, the video will rotate it in a direction, the other hand, if you include it from the other side side side back.
These interactive ritory are aware of others.
If you tell them what they are interested in what they are doing.
If they come circumstances, they can get a little bit of it.
If they come circumstances, they can get a little bit of it.
They also have their movement and including them.
And then we realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the common to use the data manages on data, like a color as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured like a green dynamic and I can use them to versate the color in the central that in the central that in the central that in the central that in the central -- where they mix them them to be in the middle of the color in the central -- where they are missing to skill.
and I can use them to versate the color in the central that in the central place.
If we are too much about it, we can put a little bit of it.
There are also nice possibilities of learning, like languages, mathematics and games where people can try to try the speed and see the results where people can try to do things fast.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonaces that I do with a equations.
So here we have a game of words between Scarabeo and Boggle.
Orrically, at every turning on every Siftable, Pratically, at every Siftle, Pratically, at every TV on every Siftable, and whereas you try to make words about a dictionary.
Then, after about 30 seconds remission, and you have a new set of reading and new possibilities.
Thank you.
And here is what kids came to the Media Lab, I did it so that they tried them and turned a video video.
They are pleasuraged a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give you a lot of educations.
You just say, "Compions of words," and they know exactly what to do.
That's what other people do it.
This is our own beta younger head on the right.
It actually wanted to take a mix.
They were only morning, for him.
Now, this is a application of a carton interactive carton.
We wanted to build a tool to learning the lingue apture of the lingue Hel's Felix.
It can snake new characters in the scene, satisfiing the Siftable associated.
It can snake new characters in the scene, satisfiing the Siftable associated.
So it's doing it out of the sun.
Video: The sun. It's surgengy.
David Merrill: Now it has taken a treatment.
Video: The arancient treatment.
Bel job. Yeah, yea!
So schooling the Siftable and putting it can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing their history.
Video: Hell!
DM: It's a story with the open final story with the open final -- and it can decips.
DM: It's a story with the open final story with the open final -- and it can decips.
Video: Golden -- --
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, made of recently, to sample and execguing music.
It's a very recently, a recently made recently, for sample and executting music.
Siftable here act sounds like the base, based and bacteria --
Every one of these are four different variations, and you can choose what it is.
You can put these sound sounds in a compound sequence to your pleasure.
And to modify it simply by doing a sound and a "sequence."
These are actually you can control of living -- like the reveral and the filtro.
You attacks to a particular sound and then including them them together.
And then there are the general as time and flights to the sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to try and put a basic in two Siftable "sequency," we add it in a seriously, we add it in a seriously.
Now I put a bunch line.
Video: DM: Now I add some of the other --
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the bacteria at the bacteria so I can control the living living in the live.
Video: DM: I can fit the entire sequence by a side, or from the way or from a side or from the other.
Video: And now I will add the filter to give the bottom to get more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombined the sequence "fle."
So I don't have to plan earlier, but I can sudden, make a longer longer or more cortex.
And now, finally, I can sfummmouse the Siftable to the left the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces man-machine interfaces more of the way our brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this lost and also some possibilities that we're trying to get out of the lab to bring out of the lab --
The concept that I want to transmitty is coming this new generation of objects designed to interact with digital media in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the now of talking to all of you.
I'm a writer.
To swooks is my profession, but it's more than that, of course, of course, but it's more than that, of course,
It's also love and the fall of my life.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But, said that, something particularly happened in my life and in my career, which has brought me to receive the entire relationship with this work.
The particular thing is, I was written about this book, this biography called "Mangia, Pregion, Ama" the quality, and so so I was a very large predicted, for a few reason that he had become a biographic sense, bestseller interaction.
And the result is that everywhere you go to me as if you have been convicted to me.
To -- convicted -- convicted -- convicted -- convicted --
They go from me to all worried and say, "You don't afraid to do me?
You don't keep writing about the entire life without being able to write that could be able to make a book that can care to do a book that can care to someon?"
what can you care to anybody us?"
It's rassicurant, you know.
But it could go worse -- to the worse than 20 years ago, when I started to tell people -- I was a training -- I was a training -- I wanted to be a writer.
I would go to the same reaction reaction of the fear.
And people say, "Don't you know I would not be able to have success?
You don't fear that the humiliation of refute to kill kill?
You don't fear to do this mestior not anything that anything else is ever outside and die on a mest-bank heart bank bank bank hands to shake sets of hold hadn't you fear s?"
So, you know, you know.
The answer -- the brief answer to all these questions is: "Yes."
Si.I afraid of all of those things.
I always had fear.
And I also have fear of many other things that people may not be initiated.
As the algae and other things about it.
But for the way to write what I thought and ask me the last and ask me the last question, is why?
Is it rational?
It's logical that anyone who should be waiting for being sweated, to be a job to do.
But what is that particularly in the unpredous creative to make us nervvous about the mental health in a way that other carefully not to do that?
As my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activities in which he was asked if he was afraid to be engineer to be engineer engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer with chemical engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of the activities of activity in which was asked him if it if it was asked if it if it was about it was asked if
It was never -- that block of engineering John, how much it does?
It wasn't working like this, right?
And so chemists, chemical engineers like group don't have certainly the seately, in the seat, and the reputation of being alcolighed man.
We writers -- we have enough this reputation, and not only writers but creatives of any generally, we have this reputation of being enormously instabmentally.
And it's not about looking at the triste contitude of the magnificent deaths that only creative creative that only in the 2th century, they die young people and often often get them.
And also those who are suicide seem to be really, in fact, they have to be disded by their womans.
Norman Mailer, before Mailer, in the last interview, he killed a little bit of a little bit more about the work of his life. It's a very much more about the work of their life.
But we don't dying, when we feel this because we have heard these things that so much long-way we have completely interior and accepted the notion and the notion are somehow related to the creativity and that art, will be a few ways, and that the art, will will always be a few ways,
And the question I want to bring to all of today, is you agree with this idea?
So it's good for you -- because if you look at it from a distance to me not good for this supposition.
I think it's odious.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better encouraging our great creative minds.
And of course, I know that in my case -- in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous supposed to start out that I felt the constitutions, especially dated the circumstances in my career.
Too -- -- I think about 40 years old, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely that anything I write about now is going to be judged from the world as the work that came after the world as the work that came up with my last book.
I'm going to be slavery, because we're all over here -- is likely to my spells here -- is likely to my shoulders.
Oh, Gesood, which is thinking.
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start bing in the morning and I don't want to do it.
I would keep doing this work that we do.
So, the question becomes going, right?
And so I think, after many reflection that the way to work and write that the way to do to do is to make a performance of perted, right?
I have some way to find a safety distance between me, which I'm writing -- and my natural analysis on which reaction that write that will be able to get the last year models about how to do it starts to look through time, trying to find other societies to see if they could have have the best ideas to have ideas and healthithy and healthy healthiest models if they could have have the best things and healthy for the most health and healthy
how to help people create the emotional inerents of creative risks of creativity.
And that research took me to the Greek and ancient Room.
I will go back to the circle and then back back back.
In ancient Greek and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity was not to believe that creativity seven-selling manages, OK?
And it was thought that creativity was this spirit, they look at the men and sevened to humans from a few distant and unknown.
The Greeks called these spirits darians of creativity "demony."
Socrate, wonderful, he believed to have a demand that he'd have a sweet.
Romans were of the same idea, but they called that spirit without a genius a genius of the spirit of the same body --
The one that is great, because Romans didn't think that a genius was really a genius was a particularly smart.
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine entity that created was living in the walls of a artist, a little bit like the element, a little bit like the elfe Dobby, and that came to assistant the work of that work.
Ecceptional -- -- -- that is the distance of what I talk -- that psychological that has a psychological that protects you have the results of your work.
And everybody knew that was so that it was so that it worked, right?
So the antic artists were protpects from certain things, like the too narcisss; right?
If your work was very exceptional doesn't have to take all the degree and all knew that he was helped by this incorporeo.
If your work fail, it wasn't all of your work -- right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable to be a inable.
And so the people handed creativity in the Ocker for a long time.
And then the Renaisment came and all changed this great idea; we put the human beings to be human beings and without misteries and the mysters and without misteries to make the mities that write the deves.
This was the principle of humans rational and people started thinking that creativity was thinking that creativity was completely completely from the idividden ish.
And for the first time in history, it started to reference this or a kind of a genius as a genius as a genius to a person with the genius to a person with the genius to a genius to the genius to this or a person with the genius to a genius to a person with the genius or a person with a genius to a person with the genius to a person with a genius to a person with a person with a
And I need to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think that allow someone to believe someone to believe that it's like a recipe as a recipe as a recipe as the source and the surprising mysteries and creativity, unknowable and eths is a very much too much to give to the fragile fragile human.
It's like to ask someone to ingowear the sun.
Deform and distores all these ingestive ingestiable ingestiable for performance.
And I think it was this pressure to have destroyed the artists in the past 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think the question is, and I think the question becomes on?
Can we do it different?
And so you can go back to a understanding more of the relationship between humans and creative mystery creative mystery of human relationship.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cut 500 years of thinking about thinking about rational thinking.
And you probably have people in the audience that would be suspects of scientific suspects about the notion -- unfolks that follow people get to move on their projects.
I probably don't convince you all about this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why no?
Why don't you think about this way?
Because it has more sense of everything that I've ever heard to explain the exasperants of creative process.
An process that anybody who I've ever been trying to do something -- so, so, all here -- yeah, not behaviors.
And, in fact, it can sometimes seem completely paranormal.
I did this recently with the Ruth in the Ruth Stone, which has now 90 years, but it was a poet-year-old poetic for all life and told me that in his child's rural.
And he said it was like a fragorous fragorous fragory.
And that was rolling back to her landscape.
And it was to get it, because it was doing the earth below his feet.
He knew that we have one thing to do to that point and it was -- words like a morning."
And so it was going to go home and came up with this poetry, and he wouldn't have to make a piece of paper and a mate, and a fairly fast enough, as the tradition and it was collecting it on the page.
Sometimes he couldn't be fast and so it was correct and correct and the correct was going to get home and the poetholing through and her lost and she would continued to break through the landscape, and he would keep roll up with the landscape, as he said, "another poet."
And then there were times -- this piece I don't forget -- there were time to -- there were moments in which the was almost loss; right?
So, he was running at home and was trying to card and the poem was going to go through it, and he was a marg in the while he was passing, and then he said, what it was like to hold and and the step off.
He was offered the poem from the tail and returned it to his body and turned it to the page.
And in these cases, the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intacts but the word, the last word to the first word at the first one of the first word at the first one.
So when I felt thought -- it's crazy, it's just equal, it's equal to my creative process.
I don't all my creative process -- I'm not a conducting.
I'm a mult, and my work way to work is -- wake up to the same orary every day and sudden and go over and go over and go over and go over over over and over over over over the time.
But even I was in my head, in my head, I stand strike against that thing, at the time,
And I imagine that many of you have done.
You know, even if the work and ideas came up with ideas came from a certain source source source I couldn't honest.
And what is this thing about that?
And how can we relate to it in a way that we don't have to lose the head, plutting, what do we do to stay awaste them?
For the best example of me -- the best example I have is the musician that I have is musician musician and I interviewed different years ago for a newspaper newspaper in the day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life has been the incarnation of the article -- to control these kind of creative impulses of creative impulses of creatic impulses of creatic impulses of creatic impulses of creatives of it.
But then I got it, and he was driving on a day when he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles, changed all over him.
It was going to go fast, and all of a melodies this little bit of melodies, which comes into its head as inspiration, elusive, and the wants -- you know, it's wonderful, and the wish, you know, it's wonderful, and the wish, but it doesn't know how to take it.
It has no maybe, it has no mate, it has a record -- it has a recorder --
So it starts to feel this sort of old anxiant to be to grow in him like, "I'll lose to lose it, and remarrate from this persemble song.
I don't have enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to stopped in the blood stopped it.
And I would take the entire process and did something completely new.
And he just looked at the sky and said, "Cuse, don't see that I'm driving it?"
"Do you look like a song nove?
If you really want to exist, you get to a more opport, when I can take care of you.
Other of course, you go to to each other today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process process changed after that.
I don't work -- the work was even dark as a sempre---
But the process of the heavy that was released when the genius took the genius was releasing the genius causing nothing about problems and free it remaining that it was not a interior that had to be a interior -- and the torent of the back.
but well-beyond this peculiar bizarre collaboration between Tom and this thing that was not Tom.
So how much the story started to change a little bit the way I was working and I've already saved me a time.
This idea, I save me when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Amae and fall in a disperation where we all all when we are working on something and we all all when we are working on something and we can start thinking that it's going to be the worst book that the worst ever ever ever ever written before.
Not just bad at the worst book written about.
And I started thinking about throwing this project.
But then I remember Tom who talked about the air and try it.
So I went to the face of my face to the hand and I would say, a while, and I would make my comments to a room.
And I said, "You know, I said, "You know, what we do if this book is not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant, right?
Because as I am going to take all the way that I have, I don't have that.
So if you want to be better you have to introduce you and do your party.
Okay, but if you don't do it, you know what, I don't know it is nothing.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I want to favor that was recorded that I was now to do my particular, because -- at the end is like this, well, -- -- the end is like this, OK, -- sites in North Africa people were raising for the dances of the dance of North Africa and dances that were going to get forward to the walk and the heba.
And they were always magnificent because the ballers were professionals, and they were fantastic.
But every time, it was something happened, and one of these artists became actually translent in reality transendent.
And I know what I talk, because I know what you have, because I know is a certain point -- a lost that way.
It was like the time to stopping and the ballery walks through a species of ballery and he was not doing anything from the sun, like 1,000 nights earlier, but all you switch it.
And suddenly not only appearing like human.
But you accines from divince and delimined in the fuel of divinity.
And when this happened, the next time, people knew what was was, was called it with her named her name.
They had the hands and started singing to meet up to meet "Allah, God God, God."
That's what God, you know.
Heean-note history -- when the south Spain the South Spain was -- they took this habits with their and ready to change in the century of the 19th to Allah, Allah, he still changed in the box, or in flamenic.
In Spay, when a artist has done something impossible and magic -- "At it, you know, Allah, magnifire, I mean, I encountered -- a God.
And it's greatly because we have need.
But the problem comes up the next day, for the ballerin the ballerin the morning and discovers that are 11 in the morning of Martedons, and then last God is not more.
It's just a mortal with big male of the knees, and maybe it will never be able to each other.
And maybe nobody will give the name of God still as the given as the rest of his live?
It's hard to be it.
This is one of the most painful rereconciliations to do in a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angoshing if you can not believe it, the most extraordinary aspects of your being being being from you.
But I just believe that there is a data that I got to get from a inimaginable source of the life that you then get to go to somewhere when you finished.
And, you know, if we think in this whole way change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's certainly as I thought for several months in the work of the book that public was the work that I am a very quickly, the dangerous spectacularly followed my great.
And what I have to keep telling me when I switch out of this is, not having fear.
I don't flow it to be just your work.
It is to introduce you for your party, any can be.
If your work is balling, bally.
If the divine, I assume genius decided to leave a few of wonder, for a few things to get a very strength, then "Oh, yeah.
Otherefore, you do the same thing.
And "Oh, you know, you can yourself be it.
I think I think it's got to teach it.
"Look!" to yourself, even for human had love and testing and testing talks to make you continue to introduce you to get to introduce you continually.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Or!
As you know I've been talking about some of these projects on human, about what can mean, and what the discovery new genes.
Now we're starting a new percorsounds -- we began to digitalize biology and now starting to the digital code and we're going to go into a new fashion biology, designing and sympts.
We always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is the vice? It's something that many biologists I think they tried to understand a levels.
We tried a different approach, reducing the minimes.
We're types by about 20 years ormas.
When we sequenced the human genome was treating to spend from the analog world of biology to the digital world of computer.
Now we ask ourselves, can we regenerate the life or make new life from this digital universe to the digital universe from this digital universe to the digital universe
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from the genome genome between those that can authoring in the lab --
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a more smaller.
We can eliminate a hundred genes of the genes about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the map of his metabolic map to the noistr.
So I think, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate it, one at the time, it's very unlikely to a living cell.
So we decided that the only way to progression was synthesize this chromosomes so that we could modify the components to bring the components to bring some of these fundamental questions.
And so we began the avventure of the "Can we can synthesize a chromost?"
Can the chemistry to produce these great molecules that we haven't been able to make these big molecules that never have been able to do before I hold that?
And in case of affermative, can we make a chromoso?
A chromosome is simply a piece of chemical material in the inert of it.
The speed with which we can type the life is growing is growing to exponential res.
Our writing the genetic code, ages rather slowly, but it's better, but it's better.
And our most recently resulted the leading care care curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process required a lot of the past, starting with a bioetic revision before we started the first experiments.
But we found that DNA synthesize DNA is very hard to it.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that are small-century segmental processes of 30 to 50 letters and it's a degenerative proces: the more segment is longer -- the more mistakes.
So we had to develop a new method, to assembling these fragments and reward the mistake mistake the mistake of the mistake and reach the mistake the mistake of these fragments and reach the mistake of these frames and correct the mistake of these fragments and correct
And this was our first attempt to start information from Phi Gerge genome information genome of Phi 174.
It's a little virus that kills bacteria.
We designed the fragments, effectively the reports and get a molecule and get a molecule of about 5,000 letter letter of DNA of about 5,000 letter letter of about 5,000 letter of the DNA of about 5,000 letter letter of about 5,000 letter of DNA of about 5,000 letter of the DNA of about 5,000 letter
The interesting part of it is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material and we put it into the bacteria and started reading this genetic code and reduced the particles and to produce particles the virals.
The particles have been released by cells, they went back and they fit back and they destroy the E.
I talked about reports with members of the petrolife's saying that they certainly understand this model.
They have reported more of you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things in larger --
We wanted to build the entire chromosome.
They're more than 58,000 letters of genetic code.
So we thought we could build it in the bottom of virus, so that we can change the cycle to understand what the components of a living cell.
The design is crucial and if we start with digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995, the standard accurateless of a 10 mile mibasis.
We found it, 30 mistakes. If we had that original sequence that original sequence we never have been able to be able to do it.
One of the process is designing segments that are long-segment seges with all the other segments of 50 letters to build underunit that could make underunit in the small rooms that work together.
We try to have a few things here.
You probably have a bed bed that we have a flight.
Think of it this is we have a genetic code based on four letters: AS, G.
Three of those readers with the layers code about 20 amminoids, and there's a specific order to every amminoid to each amminoid for every amminoids.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, you know, I thought, fraasked.
What we have done to be self-self-to do it.
Some of them have been dolphuses from the fact that it was not poetry.
We designed these segments to just unize them with encies.
There are enzymes that repair and put them together.
And we started assembling from five to seven miles from five to seven miles to seven miles letter to seven miles in order to form sitting in 24 miles that time to 72 miles to 72 miles.
Every past we produced these sites in abundance so that we are trying to make a foreign except to make a very robate procedrying -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatizing the process.
So this looks like the tabellon a basket.
When we get to these very long-folder segments more than 100 miles -- it will not grow more directly in the E.
You get to the limits of the modern molecular biology molecular biology.
So we have considered other mechanism.
We knew about another mechanism called homology, which is in biology that in biology is useful to repair the DNA to repair the DNA to unique the segments.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiohard ans, can absorbute three million rad radiation.
You can see in the diamong distruct like his chromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours comes reassembled exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that have a thousand organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be able to be able to check completely.
They can live under a vacuum.
I'm absolutely absolutely sure life exists in space, and you smoke, and you smoke.
NASA showed that this is that this happening now.
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes -- just using the process of designed by the design of inserious segments with the design segments to inseriouss.
The lights them assemble automatically.
This is not been taken with a microscope with a microscope with a very regular, but with a very regular.
It's a molecule so the very big that we can see it with a microscope slightly reading about it.
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a few years ago.
They're more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the largest molecule of a definitely ever created by the man.
It's got a molecular weight molecular fish.
If we stamp it with a 10 paper per per spaces, it would take 142 pages only to turn this genetic code.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we activate that?
Of course, you get a virus is a very young girls.
It's a little more complicated when you use bacteria it.
It's more simpler when it's eucarioes like ourss: you can just extract the nucleus and put it on a nucleus and inserirst another one -- which is basically the process of clonation.
In the bacteria archaea is a fall in the cell but we recently showed that we can do a complete train of a cell trailing a cell trailing a cell to another and active.
We purified a whiling from a microbial species.
The two of them are the way to the topies.
We added a few genes more in a way that we can decide what to do for this chromosoon.
And then it took it to the enzyme with the enzyme so that they can kill all proteins.
And when we put it in the cell was stupendoctor -- and you open our graphic soft -- the new site -- the new site was gone inside the cell phone.
And we were thinking that we couldn't go to the way to go to the way to get us to get to get us over there.
This is one of the most mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third third one third third a few parts, adding in a second thousands of new trats trats to that species.
So who think about evolution as a only gene to the time that it has no understanding of biology.
There are enzymes called restriptions of restriptions is that all digesting DNA.
The chromosome that was in the cell is not possibly possible.
Tell phoo -- the cromosomes we have inseritos.
And it turns out the other chromosome, and it recognized, and we found it -- and we found it and we found it with only the cellula and the new chromosoon.
It became blue because of the genes we have inserved.
And in a short lasses of time, all the characteristics of a species have been lost and moved all in a new species, based on the new software that we inserted in the cells.
All the proteins have changed, member of the member has changed, and when we read the genetic code balance to the same as we have transference.
Now, this seems like genetic alchemy. But altering DNA DNA can change things in a very replace.
Now, I explaned that you don't talk about genesis -- but of progress from three million years and a half million years and a half million years and a half of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to make a new version of Cambrian explosion process.
Why do I do that?
I think it's enough when we think of our needs.
We're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just for give you an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946; 40 years, there are going to be four years, there will be four years, there are going to be three people on the planet for each other than everybody.
We're having problems now to find food, fresh and fresh and drink and drink and dance, medicines for six billion and a half billion people.
It will be even more hard to do it for nine billion.
We use more than five billion carbon barrels of carbon boiles.
That means a hundred million barrels a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to rempirate them, it's going to be a huge challenge to me.
So we have to keep the whole of CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere.
At the day, because of the scientific discoveries of the scientific discover in the world, we have a database to think that are the design components for the future.
The electronic industry is only a dozen about component, and think about how many different things have come out of them.
Our limits here are principlely biological data and our imagination.
Now we have techniques to these methods quickly symptetization, in order to make what we call a combinator.
We can build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
Think about these 20 million genes of different genes or try to try to get the process to produce either either or drugs or new vaccines, we can change -- we can change -- we can change that over the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard.
We can choose for chance of survival, or carbon dioxide or carbon vaccines.
This is a computer programmed some software programmed to have programs that we're working to be able to sit and design species to design sort of sell us and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how we do it be done.
We know exactly what their genetic code.
Now we're focusing on carbon carbon of fourth generation.
You also see you you who extract ethanol from the grate was a mal.
We have carbon depending on and third generation that will come up enough sugar, as a carbon and higher than the eight as the eight or different kinds of thrown --
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing more than food and limited the cost of food and limited the conditional and will be transforming the degree of CO2 cells that can get to design this purpose -- and we are going to have the first carbon cells that can reach this purpose and we have the first carbon fourth generation in about 18 months.
The sunlight combined with CO2 is a methodo-- but in our discovery in the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
And it lives in the deep, about 2,500 meters of the temperature of ebollies.
It creates meter from CO2 molecular hydrogen molecular source source sources.
We're trying to understand if we can switch the CO2, which can easily be transported to be transported to that CO2 in carbon in carbon to drive this process.
So we think about a brief we think we can be able to increase what the question of the basic question is, "What is the vice Noen, true -- we have the modest objective to replace the entire petrochemical industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do that?
It would be a main of energy source here.
And so we are working to use the same methods to make methods to make the same methods to make the same methods to make the same methods to make the same methods to make the same methods to make the same methods to make the same methods to make the same methods to make the same methods to make the same methods to make methods to make meetos.
You saw this year with the influence, we're always backed out of a year and a dollar dollar, when it's going to find the right right now.
I think that what you can change in combinable vaccines in anticians.
So here's how the future could start to be changing, the tree of evolution, accelerating the evolution, accelerating the evolution with bacteria and infinally euclearly cells.
We're so much so that from improving people.
Our purpose is to do so much to try to try to make a lot of it. Thank you very much.
First of all of you to see it, the fastest possible, a few fundamental jobs, the new technology that we took the Microsoft to a year ago -- that's almost a year ago -- that's Seadragon.
It's a lockey environmental level that you can interact with a very large amount of visual data to remote with a huge amount of visual data --
We're seeing a lot of the gigabyte of digital pictures with a kind of digital zoom costs, and for a very quickly fast panoramic picture.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see -- how big these data collects of data or images.
Most of them are all digital photographs, but this is a program from the Library Library of Congresss and rewalk into the leg, of the Congresss and in the leg.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen. It's also a very flexible architecture in any time. It's also a very flexible architecture in any time.
This is a book inter, example of data doesn't imagine images.
This is the Dickens. Every column Casa chape.
To shown you that is just about testing and not images, we can do something like this, to see that it is a real representation of the head, not a picture.
It may be a little artificial and to read a electronic book.
I don't adviled.
This is a more realistic example is about a number of the Guardian.
Every very picture is the beginning of a selection.
And it really gives you the pleasure of reading the version of the version of a magazine or a fifth of a magazine or a lot of it.
We also did something with the corner of this number in particular.
We created a higher advertising high-resolution ads -- much more than the one that you use in a normal normal commercial. And we put you in a normal content content of extraordinary content -- and we put you in a normal content --
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific techniques.
And this really shows some of these ideas to heliminate the limits of space on the screen.
And we hope this lady putting to put a few pop-up and some sible, not to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And on this is not to lose time, if I don't say that we have contributed to the field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. springs over a geost image of NASA geospatial image of NASA geospace of the United States.
So now we move to something else.
This is actually from the living on the Web on the Web -- you can see it.
This is a project called Photosynth, which fighting two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer to do interesting computer to do it from Noah Snavely, a student, with the help of Steve Seitz of the Rick Szski and Steve Seitz UWashski Microsoft Research. It's opopopopopopopopopoptions. It's optima collaboration.
And it's from the web, managed by Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screens that we can spend from one image to the other and have this kind of resolution to the multiple experience.
But the space collection of the images here has actually a meaning.
The algorithms of the computer have recorded these images together, so that they correspond to the real places, so that the images -- all the way the real. And you get the Grassi on Montagne Roccious Thats are doged here -- they were taken here. So you see some of the elements of panoramic imaging and these things have been linked to space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some of them are much more space.
I want to spend a directly to one of the Noah-- and this comes from a previous prototype of Photosynthize -- that we have done for the first time last summer, to show you what I think is the key key to show you what I think is the key key to the environmental of the environmental data that we put in the environmental sides.
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images Flickr. Baster's reconstruction in Flickr. Baster's Flickr. Baster's reconstruction and get images and say. Each of these around. Each of these aroundation represents a picture that it represents a picture that it represents a picture that has been discovered to this model.
So they're all images from Flickr and were all linked to this way.
And you can have this very simplicity.
You know, I would never have thought about finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratifiction to get this kind of account here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of framework from those professional sessional -- the ones of the SLR, a a number meaningful number of meaningful picture.
And if you can do that, I try to try to look at those more strange things.
Many of them are blocked by faces, etc.
Something here is a series of photographs -- there is a series of photographs -- -- -- -- there it is.
This is a poster poster in Notreally.
We can spend from the physical standing of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environmental environment. This now is taking data data from all of the whole memory of how the earth, from the visual point of visual visual -- and all those data together.
All those photos become linked together, more than the parts.
You have a model of the earth emerging.
Think about this as a prolunging work of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual Tealth --
It's something that grows in complexity as people use it, and the people who are use, and the whose advantage to use.
Their pictures are marches with metads from other people.
If anybody gets the idea of contrast all these sants say, my picture of Notres' picture of Notre Dame sudral. From suddenly has all those dates, and I can use the point of all those dates, and I can use the picture of the way that in the space, in that metaphor and have a social experiences, and have a social experiences.
Of course, a consequence of all of this is very highly elaborated all of the interesting part of the earth, so that doesn't only see the planes and and satellow images and satellite images and similar memory and similar memory and of the skills and similar memory and from the satellite images.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understand whatever your software will have to do is that at a point in the next few years, all the photographs -- all the next few years, all the pictures of them all in the world or will be connected together?
BAA: Yeah. What it's doing: Yeah.
It's creating hyperlink, if you want to do it, with the images.
And it's doing it in the content of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the rich of the simantic information that many of these images are possible.
As you do a research of images on the Web and the head on the page, has a lot of information about the pictures of the picture.
Now, what happens if that picture you link to all your picture?
So the amount of seedity of the seedity of the recipe that comes up is really enormous classical labs that is a very large effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible. Compliments.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the main pleasures when you travels and one of the inner research is the living between who has not forget the way to the traditions, between the wind, the folks in the wind, the gyprices in the wind, the waste in the wind today, the leaves in the fears today, the leaves in the leaves and plants.
You know, I think that shamans Jaguar travel even beyond the Milky and or that the old myths are still colored with the older of meaningful -- or that in Himalayas, the budged the spider of the Dharma -- to remind the world of the central antiboard of the ancient of pologies, but it's just a sense of reality of reality, but it's just a model of reality,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirps that our stirps has done, a lot of generations ago.
And, of course, we all share the essential trates.
We all hidden again.
We are subjects to get the way to be subjects to be subjects to be subjects.
We have to deal with deaths of deaths -- so we don't surprising and --
We all have a art.
What it grows is the peculiar rhythm of every culture.
Not matter that are the forest of Borneo, or the follows of Haiti, or the Haiti, or the desert of the Kaiest in Kaids' secentries of the Sahara.
He was my own own journey in the desert a month ago, or a month ago, or a yak in the Walls of Mounder Mt. Everest, the mother of Everest, the mother of the world.
All of these people teach us that there are other ways of thinking about existing ways of thinking -- other ways of thinking about the world.
And if you think a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope to give you a hope --
Inside, the cultures of the world creating a spiritual life and cultural life that has a spiritual life and cultural that will have the planet and is important for the benefit of the planet as a white biosphosphery.
And you can think about this raise as a culture as a ethnosphery and you can define the ethnosphery of all the concepts, myths, ideas, inspirations, ideas, inspirations, intuitions that are being from the human imagination.
Eetnospher's fantastic potriage of humanity.
It's the symbol of what we're and what we can be in how much pollution.
And because biosphere has been very consumed as much as it was as a ethnosphery and unfortunately too faster.
No biologist, for example, it would say that 50 percent of all the species is about the earther of the extraining -- because it just failed, or -- in the most oppositional -- in the field of biological diversity -- and you don't have to be a very untimistic -- that of cultural diversity.
The indicates of all of this is, of course, loss in language.
When you're born 6,000 languages on this planet.
A language is not only composal for a vocabulary or a series of grammarical.
A language is the price of human spirit.
It's the middle of which animates every culture comes in the material.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a skin, a sure, a spiritual ecosystem possibilities.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we are sitting in Monterey, at least half of them are not more ssurrying in the ears of children.
They don't get to the children, which means to say, unless you shouldn't get anything, which is already died.
What is that more than being sad from the silence, of being the last to talk a language, of being the last to talk a language, not to transmit the sad of the address or to anticipate the promise of the children?
This orring is the state of someone in some of the world every two weeks a few weeks a bunch and brings with a die in the bottom of the last few weeks and a language.
And I know anybody who will say, "That's not the best of this one.
The world would be not be a better place if we were all the same language -- then we talk all yoruba. Parlim we all yoruba. Parlim of the world would we have all yorube.
Let's talk about kogis.
You will be about a tract, what it means is that we can't talk about their language.
I would like to do a journey through the ethnos' --
a little journey in the ethnosphery to give you a above what we're losing out.
Many of us forget that when I say, "different ways of existing existing very different ways of existing existing ways of existing exists.
So let's take this bimb bimb bimbaby in Amazon Sepony, the popular of anacanacony, which creates the military of the layer of the slate sacries.
It's a popular popular that is not able to distinguish the blue color, because the celests is identified in the time of the forest, which depends the population.
They have a strange language and a matrimonial, said, "exogamicistica's language -- you have to spost a person talking language.
And this has radical in the past, the particular particular -- yet the particular particular -- in these extese families in which you are about or seven lingers to have no practical matrimonstry is that in this is a language.
They are limited to listen and then start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with the which I lived -- the Waorans of Ecuador nordal, an incredible popular popular that has the first contatts in 1958.
In 1957 five missionarized account-made contact of a facal mistake face.
They took the top photographs that they would take them into the few who would reach them in pose that this popular forest, forget that this popular forest, had never seen anything of the biz-dimensional bi-dimensional bi-dimensional big.
They collected the pictures of the ground and they turn to the research for a form or a fear and not find nothing, they have conclouds, and they killed the five mission of the diavolian hits.
But the Waorans didn't kill the foreign only foreign foreign only the foreign of the foreign --
They killed between them.
54 percent of the death was caused by their own sex.
We have been risking eight generations and we found two natural deaths and when we put it up to know -- they put a of them in the agree again that has been so that it has been aging -- and then they killed it the same thing. Risthey.
Cathers were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the early 1980s, I was assigned a very interesting compit when my professor asked asked me if I want to go to Haiti to Haiti to intrufolds between the secret society of Duvalized societies of Duvalized and the Tonton Macoutes, and the Tonton Macoutes, and the Tonton Macoutes, and the Tonton Macoutes, and the Tonton Macoutes, and the Tonton Macoutes, and the FFree professor
To make sense of a miraculture I would have to understand the Voodoo culture and that Voodoo is not magic is blacks.
It's quite a metapical vision of the world.
Very interesting.
If you ask you to tell me the great religions of the world, what would I saying?
Christiance: Islam, Good said, Ebraism, Ebraism, and so on.
A continent is always left out of it, thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious fade and Voodoo is not religious fts of these religious religious concepts, very profound nated in the tragic tragic tragics diasporate of the back.
What makes you interesting is that voodoo is the intage of life and death.
So you have to hidden the spirits.
The spirits can be invocated by Grande Aqua, respond to the rate of the dance and they replace themselves to the soul of the vive so that for a brief active to the follow becomes the die.
For this vooisters like "You know, you go to close to speak of God.
We give it in the temple and we become God."
And from the moment you have a posseduct, is the spirit that you guy, how can you do that?
So you take these incredible events -- I followed voodoo in the state of tracks that touch tough tips that touch a demonstration of the mind on the body when it catalyzed in a state of retrees.
Three all the populations that I've lived the most extraordinary Kogi Santa Markey Nevada Santa Marker's in the Colombia secentrional section.
It turns out to be the ancient civilization that once lived on the careers of Colombia in attesa in attesa of conquist, the population of the Colombia that were on the massive floor.
In a continent of blood continents, this population never been conquated by the shagnounced from the shagnounce.
Once today are governed by a click but their trained trained is just extraordinary.
The young followers are taken by the families to three or four years, and they live in a world of good and homber, in a world of good and homberry in a world of the ice for 18 years.
Two period of nine years of the way to reduce the nine months of management that translate in the uteration of the uteral of the eater of the eat, and Madre.
For this time, they get accultured to the values of their society, values that they previous prayers and only their prayers and only their prayers -- or to say the ecologic balance -- or to say the ecologic balance -- or to say the ecologic balance --
At the end of this incredible beginning, they suddenly took out and for the first time in life, at the age of 18 years, they see a tree of the first bags of the first bags -- when the sunststers the sun and the sun of the beautiful landscape comes conference in all its its its its its its own splendor. The prevent is a past of indious land. The pretty of this past --
"Right? I want you to tell you about it.
It's stupend. Now it's to be protected."
They call the highest brothers and say that us, the miners, we are the colpe-colored colpe-instrument.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think of Indian populations and the environmental environmental environmental and the old story of the noble wildyable noble noble concept in his simplicity or maybe invote Thoresu and say, these populations are closest to the Earth of us.
The Indian population is not feeling nive feelings from our algies.
There is no space for these things in the Asmat or in the geons or in the geons or in the geons -- but because of the time and reports, they created a mystic of Earth is not about the concept of being nearly -- the concept that the Earth can live because it's a nurture that the Earth can live because it's only the Earth is the most subtle of human consciousness --
What does that mean?
It means that a guy of the Ande that a guy in the world is a fun Apu that will lead to the Apu that will lead to be a human foundly and it will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place that is a very different road relationship with the mountain or that respect a mountain that is a mountain of rock that is a mountain a mountain is going to be shef and that is going to be taken out of a mountain to be a feting of a Montanks that a mountain a mountain of a mounded relationship of a moun
Whether is the death of a spirit or a core core is irrizing.
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world.
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia credating forest forest and eventually had to be cut.
And that rely has been a different human beings from my friends who believe that the forests are dimoral dididity of Hukukuk and the beat the wild and the spirits that live in the world that are living to the northern extraordination of the world, spirits that they are living in the Hukuk and the spirits that they are living in the world that are living in the world that are living in the world that are living on the world
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually make different reality -- you'll start understanding some sensely discovery very very sensation.
I took this picture of aprile in the Amazon Amazon Amazon.
Maybe some of you have heard of the ayahuase, the most powerful repertool of the repertoday's repertoo.
What makes the ayahuas's potential is not the potential for the potential of the replace, but his elaboration. It's made by two elements.
From a six, this lian lea series of carboline, harmine and harmine and harmine and molinogenes.
And by Prending the only plant coffee that you can have a coffee that you can see the coffee of coffee family's said Psychotria fall of the coffee of the coffee was said Psychotria.
This planta plant is powerful powerful to the serious methyltrypt-methyltrypt-5, methoxyltryptamine-5-method.
If you ever see the Yanomami tyrare on for the nose that they do from a different set of species, anchecks of them -- which is methoxyltryptptamines.

I was often to my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who took the psychchological was with his discovery, with her discoveries of the 1930s.
Second my text is not to classessed these triaminogens because if you're done not in fact, you can't tell anybody to be halluck.
You can get the earthly if you put it with other substance with the chemicals that dened the MAO.
Now it's the beauty beta-carboline that are inbygen in this book-AO, of the same kind of need to potentiate triptamines that are available to a four-hour of plants, how these populations are not a similar death -- how these populations are not similar, but if you do that creates a biochemical version that is dangerous version that is the dangangers?
We use the great euphemism of proof of the proof of the proof infrutting.
But if we ask Indians, you say, "The plants tell us to tell us about it."
What does that mean?
This tribe, Cofan, has 17 variety of ayahuase, which distinguished in the forest, and that our eyes would go into the same species.
If we ask him how they stabilize their rate rate will tell us "I realized that I was realizing that I said, "No."
The solution is, you take 17 varieties in a night of a full and each channels with a different different tune.
With this is not a Harvard, but it's much more interesting than contare the stames.
Now, [[unclear] the problem is that also the ones that have heart people who have the kids who have to get them painting them but somehow to the marges of the story about our real, and spent it backs to our real world -- and it to be hadn't been flow down.
In fact, the X-century, 300 years, it's going to be reminded for his wars or its innovation or its innovations that but rather like the way we stopped and we have about, and we have embractive the destruction of the diversity of biological diversity and cultural the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All cultures through the century of the centuries have been involved in a dance for new lifestyle.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians have no existed to be Sioux when they put away from the ark, and so quickly as Americans don't have to be Americans when they put from the horse and calculus from the horse and calculus
It's not the change or technology that threats the ethnosfer. It's the poter.
The last domination.
And if you look at the world, you will find that these are not culture destined to disappear.
They are living creatures and dynamics existence from the existence forces that are beyond their adaptation.
Whether is disbodic spots in the patries of the Penans.
a popular nofilled in the south-year-old -- a population that has lived in the forest, to a generation ago, and now reduced to a generation ago, and now reduced to the rivers of the rivers -- where you can see the rivers of the rivers that looks like the rivers of the Meria, where the Japanese Meria, where the Japanese Meria, where the blaves the Japanese Meria, where the Japanneural High the Japanneut,

If we move on on Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the hard hard of political domination.
As you know the genocide -- the physical existing of a popular popular population, but the ethnogist destruction of life of a population of life of a population of life of a population of life -- not only it's celebrated in certain environments, because it makes part of the strategy of development.
And you can't understand the suffering of Tibet until you start to the beginning.
I lost the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China in the West through Tibet sudden, coming to Lhasa young line, but only came to Lhasa young line, but only come to Lhasa -- I realize what is about the statistics we feel about it.
6,000 monuments sacred in the polymers and cenergy.
1.2 million people killed by military in the Cultural.
The father of this guy was ascritical to Panchen Lama.
which means that it has been killed at the time of Chinese agendeal.
Her is was filled with Santity during the diaspora that has brought the popular in Nepal.
His mother was imprisoned and her her had been imprisoned and she'd be real.
It was brought to bird in the age of two years born birth born because it could not live without him.
The sister, which has done the same -- it was mess camp.
One day he wooked up a fasraffold, a fasraffer Mao and, for this transgression, was put on the force of the workers for seven years.
Tibet Tibet can be inable, but the spirit of the population is from tens to be present.
At the end, all of the way it reduces a choice.
We want to live in the world of the monotony or we want to collect the policy world of diversity?
The big Margaret Mead, before he dies said that his most fear said that his most big fear was that in our own vision of the world, not just see the legal legs of the human imagination of the imagination of human imagination -- but a day we wake up from a dimental degree to a dimental that's going to be dementing with the other possibilities.
And it's humiliating to remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years old.
The Neoliter's revolution, which has given us to the culture of the seed-to-replacing the seed-based degree with the proof the clamn specialization and we talk about 10 thousand years ago.
The modern world world industrialized to be 300 years old.
That sharks all the story is not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with a thousand to come.
When these cultures of the world of the world is asked what it means to be human, they respond to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all have answered the possibility of being what we are, a kind of a kind of conscious things that all the popular and all the gardens can fired. And there are great moments.
I took this picture of the northern island Baff, when I went to the Inuit, when I went to the Inuit, and this man, and this man, Olya, he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather's not.
The government canadedec is not always been gentlemen with the popular Inuit and the '50s for our earlier to our sounds in colonies.
The grandfather of this man refuted to go to the argument.
The family, temping for his life, and he took all the arms, and all of his attempt.
You have to know that Inuit doesn't know the free -- the exploited.
The slices were made of heavily slying in caribs of caribs.
The grandfather of this man didn't have intimit by the article or the babies that suffering.

He hited the dog and created a brille, with the cassroom has created a sland, has a slectured another dog and and has disappeared on the bank band, and I had a sheat in the staped.
We want to talk about horse? [Risat] And this in different ways, and this in different ways, Applausian population of the Inuit and all the people of the Inuit and all the people in the world.
In 1999 government has been reduced to the Inuit has rejected to Inuit the total control of California and the Texas I put together.
It's their new pathria. It's called Nunavut.
It's a Indian territory of indipendent. They Controllate all the resources.
One splendic example of how a national national state can recognize with his population of the population.
And finally, I think it's pretty obvious about who is in these remote areas of us was in these remote areas, realize that it's not remote very often.
For someone is home.
They represents of human imagination that reach to the tree of the theme of the theme of these children, like the same, like the sames of our children, become part of the hopefully provided of hope.
For we finally have to do it for us are convines that politicians will never come to swimming anything.

Our work is traveling in the ethnosphery to bring our public places, and the cultural places that will go out to the way to have seen it, it -- it will take it to the central reveal reveal reveal reveal in different places, and we have to find a style world in a different plural world in a plural world in a world of plural world in a world of plural world in a different plural and multicultural world.
where the sages of all the population can contribute to our collective benefit.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some of the things that I wrote in this book that I hope you have heard and I'll try to receive some links in case not not.
I want to start with what I call the official dogs.
The official dog?
The official and official societies of all the West dog's officer official society. "If we want to be a lot of our cities."
The reason is, from a side, in fact that the freedom is in itself a value, is useful, useful, is useful, useful for humans.
On the other is that if we are free, each of us can act for so that we can do everything that massive our benefit without any decidelivered to do everything that mouse in the name of ourselves.
The way to masses the freedom is to be massimilar to be the choice.
More choices people had, more free, and more people are freedom, more you have to be freedom, more than the benefit is their benefit to it.
This is so deeply radically radicted in the society that nobody would have dreamed to put it in doubt in doubt that would have dream.
And it's also deeply radicated in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has repossible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly great.
I lost a simple note on conditional conditional conditions.
In my market is 175 conditions, without contemployed the 10 variety of olive olive and 12 whales you can buy you to buy a huge number of conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional that no one of your 175 ready ready to be a huge degree of your degree is of your gradegree with the inextraditional bition that no one of your grades.
That's what the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic store, to buy a stere: CD, radio -- radio -- plast, radio plast, plast, amplification.
And in this single store, there's a big audio components of audio components.
We can make six and a half million combinations using the components that there are in one negoties.
You have a lot of choices.
Other of the world of communications.
Once time, when I was a kid, you could get all the services, to the pat the phone of the mom phone to the mom Bell.
It was reading the phone, you don't buy it out.
One consequence of that, in the way, it was that the phone is that the phone is not a most.
These times are gone.
Now, we have a variety of telephones -- especially between cellular cellphones.
That's the future.
My favorite is that in the middle, reader MP3, cut down the hidden of the hidden crashes for the Bule.
If you don't have seen it in the store, you're pretty much certain that you will get to get it to be going to get there.
And what the end is that people in the stores and ask this question and ask this question and the question and it asks this question and the answer is "No."
You can't buy a cellphone that doesn't do too much stuff.
So in other aspects of life that are much more important than water, you know, it means the same explosion of choices.
Assistance, not happens in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor of the doctor and the doctor to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor says, "Ok, you can do A, or B" "A has these benefits and these saves and these saves. What do you want to do that?"
Thu says, "Dr. Dr. Dr. gotore, what would I do with that?"
And the doctor says, "A has these benefits and these saves, and the drug these benefits and these risk."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you say, "Dr. if she was me, what do you do to do that?"
And the doctor, "But I don't want to be le."
The result we call the """Pautonomy authonomy that makes it seem like a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not a switch the fish and the responsibility of decisions from someone who knows something, which is the doctor, to somebody else who don't know -- and so it is not in conditionally -- and so not in conditional conditions.
There's a huge marketing of products of drugs, direct people like me and you, if you think it's not any sense, because you think it's not a send that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, why do they have public them, why do we have their public official?
The answer is that they want to doctor we call the doctor to ask ourselves to change the reception.
And so the fundamental thing as our ethic is ever a question of choice, as you see in this viged in this vige. We don't want to force. We don't want to force the right time. We don't think about the identity; we don't have to make it.
And we can reinventing how many times we get us so much aggrade.
which means that every morning -- to the risky -- you have to decide that kind of person wants to be.
I repushed to the family, a time perspective perspective, so it was that he was married to everywhere the most prestant, and it was that he was able to make the most prestous.
The only one true choice was with chemicals not when I think what to do later.
Over day, it's all to play it.
I think of the students very smart and I do 20 percent of work than a time.
And because they're not a brilliant because they're less diligents.
But why are they impossible to ask ourselves, "Could I marries or not, right? I should I do it no?
"Could I have to make me think before I have to think before the kids or to career at care?"
They're all orders.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implemented uncompleting the compites that I assegt and not get a good vote to my exame.
And they really have to ask it. They are important.
Now, the job: we're lucky; we are lucky, like Carl underlying technology every day, from every day, from every day, from the planet, except from Hotel Randolph.
And in parents, there's a corner, and I won't tell anyone where, where the WiFi works.
I don't say that, because I want to use it yes.
What is that meaningful, this incredible freedom that we have about the work that we have to keep on on all the time.
We can go to see our son play, with the cell phone in a pocket in a pockets, and the notebook, typically, on the knee.
And even if they're all spent, every minute we see our son roll, we also ask ourselves asking, "Do I have to answer this call?"
"Do I have to answer this hemail? I have to emboy this literally one?
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of your son was a very different boy from what would be in other conditions.
So, from any side of us -- things and small big, objects, materials and all of life, life is a question of choices.
Obut, once the world was this: Ovely, there were some possibilities, but it was not a choice.
The world today is a good thing about this: The dilemma is, "Is it a positive thing or negatively negative, or negative, or negative?
The answer is the answer is the skills.
The positive lights are all sorts so I will talk about the negative ones that negative side.
All this choice behavior two effects of the people.
The first one, paradoxyment, is that produces paralysi, is that it produces rather than freation.
With many options between the choice, it becomes very hard to do it.
I give you a meaningful example -- a study of volunteers of volunteer pensions.
A link link has been access to the data of Vanguard, the giant society of pension, with about a million.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered more than the percentage of air, the percentage of airplane 2.
With 50 sources are about 10 percent of advertising respect when they're availablelevered only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources of the ones that choose -- it's sickly hard decides, and choice comes to the questions.
And I said, and still questions, questions, questions, and of course, questions, and of course, questions don't get it.
You know that not only means that these workers from old people to get food for dog because they don't have enough money to say that the decision is so obsticking the data fundamentary fundamentary of the dator of the dator of the dator of the workers of the dator of the dator of the dator of the workers of the data.
Not participation, they're losing until 5,000 dollars a year from the dator of the data, which would be drinking to versate them.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think it makes the world like that.
"And finally for the ethchup, senape or maining or maining main?"
You would just take the right decision if it's for ethnight, if it's for ethotic decision.
You don't want to choose the wrong condition and you don't don't want to choose the wrong condition to the wrong condition to the wrong condition of it.
So this is the first effect. The second thing is, if we can avoid paralysi, and we have a choice, at the end of how we would have been so that from the result of how we would have been with less options between the options that you check it.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with lots of conditions that are choices, if you buy one and not perfect one and not perfect -- it's easy to imagine that you could have make a different choice that would be better choices that you can have been a different choices, and the reduce reduce the reduce reduce the reduce the relieving required by by the decision of the decision that decision has been a very pressuddenly defets.
even when it was a very good decision.
More choices us are so easy that you can do any detail that is insoddisfacing of the option.
And so there's what economists call it cost-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has asked very well stamattine as the value that we give the things depends on what we confrontis.
And then you know, when there are so many options that are possible to represent the features of the alternative atter and being less soddissatisssssatisssssssatisssss;
Here's an example. I have all the ones that are not in New York.
But that's what you probably think you probably like.
There's this copy of Hamptons.
A place of luse.
Spiles. High news.
Not mance anything. But what he thinks he thinks is, "Well, maledible, it's Again."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan is vid."
"I could park right at home."
And it spends two weeks with the idea that it's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants.
The cost-income cost-income costs the satisfation for what we have, even when choice was excellent.
And more are the options that we have to consider it, more the characteristics will come back against the expensive opportunity.
Here's another example.
This vigning tells us a lot of things.
To talk about the living the moment, and maybe of the living slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you choice, you can get to not do the others.
The things that we don't choose to these active attractive activities that can make less what we do.
Third point: the spiral growing of expectations.
I tried it on my skin, I tried it a new jeans.
And I just spent almost always jeans.
Once the jeans were just a few guy, they were sweet and they were sweated, they were sweated, only after they took them a life and work a lot of times, starting to go well.
So I went to buy a couple of jeweled when the old people went there, and I said, "I've got a couple of jeans, this is my tage."
The committed to me, "You want slim fit, fabulted, relaxed fit, relay?"
Do you want to do with cernier or with the bottonies?
"Do you want the rot?"
"Well you want to be a bunch or close? Ble -- he was conflicted to elencare.
I was sanced, and after a little bit of a little bit -- I could have the only guy who was the only guy who was the only one guy had no idea what I was like to try to all the maleans, then I went out of the negotis; then you get out of the negoties, with the best couple of jeans that I had ever hut.
It was the massive belt. With the whole of choice I had got the better.
But I felt worse
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worse that I was worse with all that choice were waitative to be perfected.
I was waitimated. I was waited for no exceptional when it was just a type, but when it was living 100 different different ways.
What I had watched was good, but not perfect it.
After I talked about what I was trying to do with what I was trying to do in confront, in confronted to waite.
The addition of the people don't make the expectations that are respected to increase the expectations that these are respected to the options of the options itself.
And this will be less soddisfation, even when the results are good.
None in the world of marketing if it makes it content.
Because if you know it, you don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth looks more like this.
"You were better when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse to be worse to meet the surprised to meet some pleasure.
Over the world we live -- opulent industrialized citizens with the expectation of perection -- the massive we can hope is that things are at the treatment of the expectancy.
You're never surprised because your expectations is because your expectations and waiting, you have ingiant it.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "Bases" "Yes, you want to do it."
I mean -- little bit of a fabulous moment -- which is really married and my wife is really stupendy.
I couldn't have a meglid, I didn't have to do better, I didn't have to do better, I didn't have to do better, I didn't have to do better, I didn't have to do better, I didn't have to do better, I didn't have to do better, I didn't have to do better, I didn't have to do better, I didn't have to do better, I didn't have to do better,
But it is not always a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of the jeans sets when you only have that jeans is that when you are not satisfacting, and you ask you "What, and ask you "Why?"
"Who is responsible?" The answer is clear.
The world is responsible. What could I do about us?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insoddisking -- and you ask you who is responsible responsible for you are responsible for you are for the responsible responsible for you are you.
You could have have been doing better.
With hundreds of varieties have unable to have been exchanged for the insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even if the result is valid, they feel unununknowing and damage the same, and damage the same.
In the last years depression is exploded in the industrial world.
I think a meaning factor -- not the unique factor -- of this hondepression is just that people have depression is so that people have deluent experiences because standards are too high.
And when they have to explain this situation think that the color is them.
So the final result is that in general we're in general, objectively, but we feel worse.
Let me tell you about it.
This is the official dog, what we all take for good and it's completely failed. It's not true.
There is no doubt that a little choice is better than that we don't have any any time but it doesn't have a lot of choice is better than a while.
There's a critical value, magic value. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure that we have been on a piece of the level where the choices are getting our life.
Now, from political point -- I almost finished -- from policies, the nock point of view, the nock is the follow.
What it allows all this choice in industrial society is the material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about the problem is that they don't have a lot of choices.
The problem is that they have too few of it.
So the factors that I'm talking about is a male's a male's exclusive moderns, rich society.
And what it does, and the array is this: Steve Levitt told you about how much those costs and sat seats of seats for whatels are ineated. It's a money.
I mean that these choices and dispendious, it's not just inuseless.
I'm just just deleteries.
They make us worse to stand worse it.
If a little bit of what in our societies allows to have a lot of choice was reverse in those where people have too much possibilities, it would not only be their life to make it better, but the noistr.
This is what economists call a paretyan improvement better.
A redistributions of redition is good at all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in except for us to be in the except for us to us.
To conclud: "Foom -- you can become all that I want,
You know, people of culture, think of culture, what does that weighs that fish weight?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a meless in a mouth."
"A fall casted vision of the world --
and I was also interpreted it like this, at the beginning.
But then, I think about it, I realized that that fish the long fish knows the long long time.
Because the reality of the reality of it is that if you send the mouse in the way that "everything is possible." You don't get freedom. You get the freedom.
If you break the meless so that all becomes possible to deminated.
You get the paralysis, and you reduce the benefit to it.
Everybody needs a sphere.
This is almost certainly too close to it, maybe even fish, maybe even fish, and certainly for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic sfhere for infelicity, and for the rovine.
Thank you for heart.
