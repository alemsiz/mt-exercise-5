I showed these these slide to show that the slide to show that the calototta artical calote glacial dimensions of 48 U.S. has been strets in the 408 U.S.
But this underground is the gravity of the problem because it doesn't ext the glacier.
The glacial caltactic is -- in a sense, the heart heart of the climate system.
You go and skin, and you return into the summer of extended up.
The next devices will be a quick for the last 25 years.
The ice loves are signed in red red red in red red red red in red red red red in the red of the ice losers.
As you see, you expanding the blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue.
That's the ice in inversus in the inversus of extended extinct.
You can see that the ice cosident ice of five years or more, is like the blood -- that was the blood of the body.
In 25 years is going to be like this,
This is a problem because the rescale of the ground terrailing around the ocean artical ocean artical amount of carbon -- and they come into the meters of the microbies.
I respect to the totality of the atmosphere from global warming, which is double, the amount of not return.

The growing growing in the world door to a notable note,
The environmental disasters are increasing to a ritish and without precedently previous and without precedents.
Four time you have over the last 30 years of the previous previous prices 75.
This is a sandle of all insustainable.
If you look at the story, if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 and 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day.
Look at the Pacific, from the Amer, and the Amere, towards the parts of the subcontinent -- where there's a radical roote, where a radical radical inocean or or the oceans.
The largest cause, the global warming, with the deforestation, which is the 20, is the use of fuel --
On it is a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries with China.
And they proponent to build a lot of carbon.
But we're assisting to a direction.
These are the projects of the last years and some proposite alternative versus of alternative green des.
Anyway, there's a political lottta in our country.
The carbon industry and oil industry have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon the water carbon on the top of the carbon the last year to promote carbon and oxymore.
And this picture I reminded to something,
Tennese, in the Tennesheight -- where I lived -- there's a loss of carbon digging of carbon.
Maybe you have seen the newspaper news.
This is the second largest flow of scale in America.
It was going around Nat.
The commercial published of a carbon industry was this.
Video: â™« Frosty the carbon is a kind of coal and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is always more cleaner than that.
It's a good price, adorable, and the workers are really really really shet it.
Al Gore: From here is a great coal of West Virginia.
The largest society on the mountain is Massey Coal. This is his friendministrator.
Video: Don Blland -- not I'm going to be clearly -- Al Gore Gore Reid Reid -- not I'm talking about what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clima has two campaign.
This is a bunch of baby.
Video: Attor: The COALergic we see the climate changes as a sery demility to our business.
So we have to invest a great amount of money in a big amount of money in a site string and consumming public and consumption.
In fact, carbon is not sport.
We think it's clean -- has a good profume.
So not preocuppying.
Let me do it.
Video: Attor: Carbone -- you heard a lot of the very very much.
So we do this this in a structure in a structure of the carbon is to be a clear bought to be clean.
Straordinary cars are a little rowrote rote rowing technology.

Comment: Reface. It's time of being realists.
Al Gore: A proverbio African old proverbio African old hand, you go to speak.
If you want to go back back together."
We need to go back and far fast.
Thank you very much.
The year at TED I did a TED introduction on the LHC.
And I promit to go back to the site to you about how the machine.
So I went out to the other time -- and the other time you don't have the LHC is is the largest experiment -- 27 miles of circcle.
His compit is to reach the conditions that were less than a billion years of the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
All is just the environment.
This is the car in Ginev.
We Five these mini-Big Bang in the river.
This is what I work. It's called the ATLAS -- is 44 feet and has a diameteter than 22 feet feet
This is a picture of ATLATLATLAS in built so you can see the proportions.
The 10 sectors we last last year we have acceso the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken from ATLATLA.
It was because of immense in the healthy of control.
It's a picture of the first fashion the LHC, and in the LHC, went into collision, deliberately, with a part of LHC, and spreads the several in the several reside.
In other words, when we see that the 10 sector, we understood that the machine works, the machine that is a great living.
I don't know if it was to do us exact more opposed to do the Google and vide that the page.
That means that we had a cultural impact as a scientific impact as well.
About a week later, it was a problem with the car, and it was just to these films, this films.
These files take 13,000 prints when the car works, the car works,
Now, the technical technical filters and dirand, "It's not true. I'm filming.
And they can do it because when they are very quickly the superconductors.
So, at least 271 grade temperature in the stelle, these films can take that cuts the stars, these films can take that cover the current of the starting to the current of the stars,
In one of the cross; you know, there was a magneti in the LHC, there was a dift of fabrication.
So the filmed filmed the law and 13,000 printing printed a electrical resistence of electrical print.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets, the fish magnets, and that are stopped about 30 centimeters, and that are stopped about about 30 centimeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to leave them, what we did we do with it.
We have repristinated and traveled.
Now they're return to all their underground.
I end up the end of the LHC will be new inte.
I acceness, and we expect to get the right or light, and we try and then we go so our avventure to find what the morning, and we go to find what the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these these incident incidents reaching the debate on the value of science and engineering to the frontier.
I think the fact that the fact that it's so hard to go to the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the words of a scientist, Humphrey Davy, the quale, image, the image, the image, and he difesses of his puzzle pull, his puzzo was Michael Farady, he said, "Niman is as dangerous progress of human mind as the rate of human mind that are not mysteries in nature, which are completely completely mysteries in the human mind that are not constituted to be a new money,
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about how to do that, by kids, you played it to the morning.
As you know how to reach them and so they can get them and move them and move them and move to the fact that we actually solve problems and manipulating relationships.
The space, is to foundly connected to the way we understand the world around us.
So, from informate, the use of our interaction with the physical objects with my own consulative consulative consulative consulative with my collaborator, and my collaborators, I started asking her, I started asking her, instead of having the only cursor of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse that you could make sure that if you get a little bit about the several mans,
and we get our please?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer, building Siftable.
And in fact, a Sifty is a whole great computer as a great biquery as a biscoote biquery as a biscoote --
And in fact, a Sifty is a whole great computer as a great biquery as a biscoote biquery as a biscoote --
You can move with the man, they can see the man, they can see the motion and they have a screen and radio wireless.
But most of course, are objected, as the morning, you can move to the stand they can move to the stand the morning.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem tools to manipulate information.
And as they become more physicists, conscious movement, and others, and as they grow more physics, and as they grow more physics, and they grow them and others, as we can exploring new and different stils of interaction.
He started with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show of video, if you wrote it in a direction, the video roundable video.
These ritory interactive is conscious about others.
If you do that, you are interested in what they are intoring.
If they go to the circumstance, you can get a little bit.
If they go to the circumstance, you can get a little bit.
They also have their movement and including their movement.
We then realized that one of the interesting interesting interesting was the interaction was able to use community of the data, to be a color, as if it was a cold.
In this case, we have three Sifty configured as a several several configuring the color of the color of the color of the middle of the mid-mid-mid-band-configurated like that,
and I can use them to slue the color of the color in the middle of the color of the color of the color in the middle of the color of the color in the middle of the color,
If we go too much of that, we can remit a little bit of it.
I'm also good to take you to take the kind of apply, and mathematics and games of logic and games that people can try and see the results of the immediately thing and see the results are immediately immediately immediately immediately and see the results of the things that are really quickly quickly quickly quickly quickly and see the results of the people can try to
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacking with a fingery program.
Here we have a words that is half half of Scareo and Boggle.
Pratically, to any turning, in the case on any southern Siftable, Prate, Prate, and you try to be a literal literal literally, in fact, and while you're looking for a dictionarie.
And then about 30 seconds are remissed and you a new new byet of reading and new possibility to try to be able to try to prove it.
Thank you.
So here's what the children were in the Middle in Lab, I made them and I tried it to the video.
They are pleased a lot of the lot.
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of educational educational people in the instructions.
You've just saying, "He," and they know exactly what to do.
So here's how people they tried.
This is our beta head-young better.
And it was just just a lot of them.
They were just morning, for him.
Now, this is an interactive of a carton a whole interactive.
We wanted to build a tool-to the lingue Lui Hlix.
It can insert new characters in the scene, solliant Siftable to their own associated with Siftable to the Siftable to the Siftable to be new characters.
It can insert new characters in the scene, solliant Siftable to their own associated with Siftable to the Siftable to the Siftable to be new characters.
And here is doing the sun.
Video: The sole is surging.
David Merrill: Now has brought a treatment in the scene.
Video: The treatment.
Bel work!
So schooling the Siftable and put it close to interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by the way to be a story.
Video: Ho!
DM: It's a story with the open -- and it can decide he like it.
DM: It's a story with the open -- and it can decide he like it.
Video: Gulf the gatto.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, doing this is a tool, to be recently and exeguing music.
It's a tool, made of recently, to be recently in the music.
The Siftable here are acting from sounds and bacteria --
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what using it.
You can insert these sounds in a sequence from your please.
And I just just just touch a sound" and a sound."
These are actually you can control from the living and filter and filtro.
You attacks to a particular sound and then including the southern to the stand to stay it.
And then there are the general effects like time and volume, which are applied to intersect.
We look like this.
Video: DM: We will try to put a basis in two Siftable Siftable to a serie, the extend to the other base.
Now I put a bunch line.
Video: DM: Now I add of the other percent of ussions.
Video: And I just put the bacteria to the bacteria, so I can control the effect from the living living of the living living there.
Video: DM: I can speak the whole sequence of inclining the time from the other.
Video: And I'm going to add the bottom to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombined the Redw."
So I don't have to planning the first -- but I can suddenly be able or long.
And now, finally, I can sfue the whole sequence of the left the Siftable to the Sift."
Thank you.
So, as you can see my passion is to build new new interfaces man-machine manure, as they work our brain and corpore.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this lost and some possibilities that we try to take out of the lab of the lab of the lab of the lab of the lab of this loss of this loss of the lab and I also also just show you one of the outside layers of this lose and I just show you one of the outside of the lab of this --
The concept I want to transmit is that it's coming this new generation of objects that are going to be the digital media media in our world in the way we want to do this in the way we want to transform.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a writing.
I want to go books is my professional exsion is more than that, of course,
It's also love and the love and the fall of my life.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But I said that, something particularly happened in my life and my career and my career and I had to realibrate the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is that I was just written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Prega, Prega, and I got a great previous books, for some reasons, for some reasons, and he became a big big -- feeling -- sensory --
And the result is that everywhere you were condition to me like they were condanned.
It is a real -- condannata!
They go from me to me and say, "You don't have papers and said, "You don't have to do better.
You don't have to continue to write for all the life without able to be able to create a book that can be able to somebody?"
that can care about somebody hon?"
It's rasical, you know.
But it could go worse -- I remember that more than 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I was a writing -- I was a writing.
I go to the same reaction of the flower reaction from the land.
And people said, "Don't you know, "Don't you have success?
You don't have a paper that the hummmmes?
You don't have to do this mestiate for all the life without that now's ever come out and die of the site blood of skiing with the blood blowing with the blood clear?"
So, you know,
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is ""Yes."
I am afraid of all those things.
I always had a paure.
And I also have a lot of other things that people can't ind.
As the tree and other things that you are sheing.
But what I thought about the writing what I thought and I was really good for me to ask me very much about the time.
Is it ration?
It's loved that anybody who knows to be she'd be she'd brought to do.
But what is that we have so particularly in the previous consequence to be about the minute of the minute of the mine that other carrier or not fank?
How do my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and I don't remember a single time in his 40 years of activity that was asked if he was asked if he was asked if they were asked to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be able to be engineer to be able to be engineer to be able to be engineer to be able to be able to be engineer to be able to be engineer with what if you were asked if
It was not -- that block of engineer engineer how do you do that?
It didn't work that --
Onest, engineers like a group group like group have not really really in the secouraged the reputation of being alcouraged manufacty of depressized,
We writers -- we have enough to be a reputation and not only writers but creative of all kinds of being enormously able, we have this reputation of being enormously instable,
And it's not another that look at the death of the death of the magnificificent death that creative death that I believe that, in the 1st century, they often often often for them.
And the ones that are not ssuicide seem to be really, in fact,
Norman Mailer, before I did, first of the last discover said, "I s," I killed a little bit more of the work of his life.
But we don't be, when we feel like to say because we heard these things so we heard these things so we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion of the creative that creativity is somehow much you see and that the art, and the wind, you know, the wind, you will always go to the hangoing.
And the question I want to take all of this one of our today, is you agree with this ide?
It is good to this thing -- because you go to the word from a distance to me not good for this supposition.
I think it's odiose.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great mine mine creative mind.
And I know that in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start to be the worse of the suppositions, extreme to the constances of the constances that are in my career.
Obbbe, I'm pretty young people, I'm pretty young people, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely to be just going to be judged by the world as the work that used after the world as the work that used after the last book.
He slaves, because we are all more or less love here -- is likely to my smart -- is likely to my site smoke.
Oh, Gesood,
You know this is the kind of thinking that leading a person to start to go to the nine of the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to go to do this work that we do.
So, the question I become the question of be?
And so I seeds, after a lot of reflected, which the way to work is to create a psychological costructure,
I have somehow to find a lot of safe between me, which I write my natural ideas and my natural analysis on which he wrote to the whole year and looking for all the last year. And I was looking for all the time to see if they could find other societies and see if they could find other societies and more healthiest to see if they could have been better and more healthiest and more healthiest and more healthcare about how to do you start to find other society
to help people believe that people creative to manage the inerents of creative creativity.
And that research me to the Great Greek and ancient Roome.
I can go to the game and then you go back and then go back to the back.
In the Greek and antics -- people don't seem to believe that the creative creativity came to humans from managed to humans, OK?
He thought that the creative was this spirit and they were unknown to the manages that they were able to have some surprising and unknown as a few distant distant and unknowing it.
The grew of the spirits were looking at the creative of creative creative "demony."
Socrate, wonderful creating of course, creating a demic that electric site of moon from mountain of moon.
The Romans, they were of the same idea, but they call that a kind of spirit without body a genius.
The thing is big, because the Romans, they didn't really really think that a geniio was somebody particularly intelligenious person.
They believed that a geniio was this kind of divine that created was literally in the study of the study of a little artist, a little bit like the Dobby, and who came out of nose the work of the argue of the argue and modeling the result of that work.
Ectual -- -- -- -- -- -- that is the distance of what you do -- that costructure, which you protect the results of your work.
And all of them knew that was so that it work?
So artists were protons from certain things, like this, as for example, the too narcis;
If your work was exceptional jobs you couldn't take it all the death of the decorpore.
If your work fail, it wasn't all of the bought -- right?
Everybody knew that was your geniio to be a unable inabout.
And so people han concept in Occident for a long time.
And then the Rindication came and all over this, and we put this great idea, we put the human human human at the center of the middle of the middle of the middle of the creatures that writing the creatures that write the details of details that write from device.
This was the principle of human rational and people started thinking that creative creativity was completely from the hyduate of the divided by the idu.
And for the first time in history, you know, I started to this or a genius like a genius rather than a person with genius.
And I have to tell you, I think was a big mistake.
I think that I lose to somebody -- a simple person to believe that being like a recipe as a recipe of all mysteries of all mysteries are in and unknowing is a responsibility to give a very big file, and it's a very big file, and it's a very big dealing to fragile that humans is.
It's like to ask somebody to teach the sole.
I was completely the ego and creates all these ingestiable ingestiable expectations on the loss of loss.
And I think this was this pressure to have been destructed artists in the past.
And, if this is true, and I think that I think, is the question of it because, and you?
Can we do it different?
I go back to a understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery creative of the relationships.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't go to 500 years of thinking about 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes.
And there are people between the audience that would be a suspackage of scientific suspes on the notion of the nice -- you know, you see the next fairly sweeping the projects.
I probably don't know you wouldn't go to this thing.
But the question I want to take is -- why you know?
Why don't you think about this way?
Because it has more sense of any other thing that I've ever heard to explain the creative process of creative process.
A process that as anybody who never tried to do something -- so fundamentally, all here -- s; they don't behavior.
And, in fact, it can be completely paranormal sometimes it completely paranormal.
I did this meet recently with the extraordinary poetc. And he has now 90 years, but that was a little baby for all of life and told me that when he was a little baby in Virginia, and he was going to be in the camp, and I felt in the field was the countries.
He said that he was like a fragorous training.
And that was coming to rotoling to her from the landscape.
It was going to get to the way to get the land under his feet.
He knew that I have to have one thing to do that point and it was words like a morn."
And it would be in the home and it was going to be indicted, and it would not have to take another piece of paper and a map pretty quickly enough, as the training and the training pricing it on the page.
Sometimes you couldn't be quite quickly quickly, so corrected, and correct and correct and correct and the poesthy rotoled through and she would continued to rotoling through the landscape, as he said, "another poet."
And then there were those times -- this piece of not dimentioning, I'm really really about -- there were a moment, what was almost los; right?
So, she was going to go home and he was looking at the car, and he was going through the wild and he was going to go through the other hands and then he said, "He was like you know, he was like you with the other hands and the off.
And he was the code and the released in his body and he was going to be on the page.
And in these cases, the poesthy would be presented on the perfect and intact, from the last word at the last word at the last word at the first word of the last word at the first word of the last word of the last word of the last word of the last word of the last word of the last word of the last word of the first of the last word of the first word of the first word of the first thing that was the first of the first word of the last word
So when you feel the pensaying, is a fairly -- it's exactly the creative process of my creative process of creative process.
I don't all my creative process -- I'm not a conduct!
I'm a mulate, and my way to work is -- I sweet me at the same time, and sweet and go to the past and go over the walls over the walls of the skie.
But even I was the sweep, I skie, I skied against that thing, in the time.
And I imagine that many of you have han done.
You know, even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain found, I couldn't lose it.
And what is this thing that?
And how can we relate to the head, pluttoo, pluttoo, plutt; what do you do to stay saniz?
And I review, the best example of me -- I have to Tom Waits, I have to Tom Waits, I interviewed a journey.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the major part of life was the incarnation of the argue of the argue -- trying to control these species of impulsit and make a whole whole of impulsized.
But then I went down and a day when he was driving on a day and a day in Los Angeles, he changed all for him.
He was going to go fast, and all of a sent site this little framatic frame in his head, which comes into its head, and the soubt and land, you know, it's wonderful, and the wish and the wish wish and the wish wish and wish and wish it it doesn't know how to take it there.
It doesn't have a piece of care, doesn't have a matite, doesn't have a record record.
So I started to feel this kind of old old old old old hansis in he guess to him, and I sessioned brought from this song losession,
I don't know that I can't do it and I can't do it."
And instead of go to the panic stopped up.
I just went the whole process and did something completely again.
And he just said, "Don't you see the sky and said, "Don't see that I'm driving my drift?"
"Do you look like it can write a song song --
If you really want to exist, you get a more opporting when I can take a current of you.
And I trimentions, you go to to some other today,
I wanted to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process worked in the process of changed after this.
I don't work -- the work was still dark as a seeds.
But the process, and the fishing fishing was released when the genius, the genius, the genium that was going to be a game that was going to be a glass of the back, and free it was going to be something interiororder, and they would be something interiored and gentlate themselves.
but he switched this peculie, wonderful bizarre with a conversation between Tom and the exercise that he was not Tom.
So how the story that I felt that story to change a little bit of the way I was saving and I had been saving a time.
This idea, I save when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, and fall in one of those disperation in one of those disperation where we all when we go to something and we don't start to think that it's going to be the worst writing that will be the worst written that the worst book is going to be the worst book about the worst written before.
Not just good at the worst book book.
And I started to think of object.
But then I remembered to the airly and try and try and heroes.
So I went to my face, and I would say, my face of managed and I direct my comments to a corner of room.
And I said, "You know, I mean, you know, I would be like this book is not going to be brilliant not be brilliant to myself?
Because as I see that I'm going to be put it all had, I don't have to do this.
So if you want to be better -- you have to deal you and do your parts.
Okay, but if you don't do that, you know, I don't know about it.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I want to do it for me that I was going to do my part -- the end of Africa -- the end is -- at the end of Africa -- you know, the end of Africa in the North Africa in the North Africa were used for the dance, and music, and music, and musical musical and music, and music, and music, and the music music that they were going to go to the tree and the music and the music in the tree.
And they were always magnified, because the ballers were fantastic professional and were fantastic professional and were fantastic professional ballers and were fantastic.
But every tant, I said, "something happening and one of these artists had been actually translate in translate reality.
And I know what you know about what I know you all -- because I know you all over a certain point,
It was like the time you stopped and the ballery walking through a species of portal portal land, he didn't do anything like 11,000 nots.
And suddenly it doesn't look like a human human being.
But you access from the divince of divinity.
And when this next time this next time, you know, people were were going to be that he was called his name.
They had the manues and they were starting to cant, "Allah, God God, God God, God God, "God God, God God,
That's God, you know.
Curious story, when the Mororder, the Mororder, they had this abitude and the wild of the Spay in and he was the "At the fair" in the center of the corride or in the corride or in the corries or in the corride or in the corride or in the corride or in the corride or in the flamens.
In Spay when a artist has done something impossible and magic -- "Wah, black them, you know, the magnified, and uncomfortable -- a framatically -- a last of God.
And it's big, because we have to do it.
But the problem comes the morning, for the baller's ballery -- when you sweet and the purpose of Martedged and last last of the Dod is not more.
It's just a death with a great male with a great male to the knee, and maybe not going to make a treaty.
And maybe nobody will be the name of God still as the game of his lives?
It's hard to be difficult to it.
This is one of the most pathose, to do in a creative life creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angoing, if you could not believe that --
But I believe that I'm going to be data in the prester of the foundation of your life that you have to go to somebody.
And, you know, if we think in this way change.
And so I started to think, and it's sure as I thought, and it's sure as I thought for several months during the work, the dangerous please, the dangerous pairing of my largest --
And what I have to keep to tell me when I feel like to go to this is, I don't have fure.
I don't fall the time.
Continuy to present, for your parts, any can be.
If your work is bally.
If the divin, assurging and assigned decided to leave you some kind of wonderful -- for a few kind of wonderful time, you can only be a while, then "O!"
And I said, you know, I got the same your dance.
And "Ok!"
I think I think I should have to teach it.
"Your housness, even for the human and testing and testing and testing talks to go and you just just to do it continuously.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: O!
As you know I talked about some of these projects on the human genome of the human genes.
Now we're beginning to a new percorrect: we started digitalize biology and now we're going to start from that digital code we are in a new fasking of biology, designing life.
We always tried to take a big questions.
"What is the life?" is something that many biological biological switched, I think they have to understand varies in the layers.
We tried sever, I reduce the minimum to minime minimplements.
We're digitalize from almost 20 years now.
When we sequence the human genome was treated to spend from the world of the biology world of the digital world of the digital computer.
Now we asked us to regenerate life, or create new life from this digital universe from this digital univer?
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species of the genome of the genome of the genome that can autoroubt in the lab of a little organisms.
And we tried to reduce the genome genome to create a little smaller to create a little small.
We are able to eliminate a centinaid of genes about 500 that are here.
But when we take a metabolic map to his methabolic mape.
I believe that it's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimind, one to the time, it's very unlikely that this can bring a cellula vivent.
So we decided that the only only way to progression was synthesize this chromountain a way that we modifice the components to take some of these questions.
And so we started the "Can we can synthizing a tail?"
Can you know, the chemistry of these great molecules that we never did the companies to create before the earth?
And, in fact, in fact, we can we make a chromosom to work a chromoon that?
A chromosome, it's just a piece of chemical material with unert.
The speed with which we are able to digitalize life is growing the exponential exponential exponential of the exponential is to be able to digitalive the living is growing is growing up to the life is growing to be a very quickly exponential of the speed of the life is growing to be a very quickly ex
Our ability to write the genetic code code and rather slowly, but it is implantly improgression of it.
And our most recent results the door exponential curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has asked a lot of steps, starting with a bioetic revision before we started the first experiments.
But we found that synthesize of DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be there.
There are tens of thousands of the world that make little segment segment segment segment of 30 to 50 letters reading and it's a degenerative process is long, more mistake.
So we had to develop a new method, to assemble these frames and correct the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt to start with the digital information from the digital genome of the Phi of Phi 174.
It's a little virus that kills kills bacteria --
We designed the framments, effectively the correction of errors and got a molecule.
The interesting part is when we took this chemical material and we put it into the bacteria and we put it into the bacteria started reading this genetic code and to product the virals.
The particles are released by the cells, they went back and they distruct E.
I talked about recent with members of the petrole-of-ran industry --
They reach more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the largest things in the largest thing.
We wanted to build the bacteria of the bacteria --
They're more than 580 mile of genetic code code code code code code code code here.
So we thought about building it in the bottom-based dimensional dimensions of virus, so that we can change for what the things are components of a cell cells to understand what the wind cells s are the wind.
The projection is crucial and if we start with digital information, these have to be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the standard was a mistake for every 10 miles.
We found that, resequence to the 30 mistakes. If we had the original sequence -- we had never been able to do it.
A part of the process is to design segment seges that you sweeting with all other segal segment to build underground, and they work together.
We try to be a lot of the one here.
You probably have a bed that we insert of the flight.
Think about this thing: We have a based code on four letters and T.
To those reading these lesson with the codifice about 20 love and there's a specific order to reading reading for every love for every love with a framat.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, fraise --
What we did we do to do this to be authography.
Some were dolphins were dolphin that was not a poetry.
We designed these segment to just just just to see with a major unusual with the potential with the potential segment for a few years to be just to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do these
There are assumptions that reparate and put them up.
And we started to assembling of the parts, stars, starting with five to seven miles, the literal land, unt of 24 milles, the unes of 24 miles, the liter.
And every step we have produced these segment sitting so that we are trying to make a few years that we're trying to create a very robaby procement -- as you see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this looks like the tabellow of a basket.
When we get to these very long segment segment segment segment -- they don't grow more directly in E.
You get to the modern tools of the modern biology molecular biology of molecular biology.
So we have been a other mechanisms.
We know another mechanism called recombination recombination called the recombination of the biology of biology to reparate DNA to be able to be able to unive the segments.
Here is an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radioastic Deinococcus three million rad radiation.
You can see in the square the southern square are destroy to be destroy in the southern square coming up in the southern square are destroying in the ground.
In 12 -- 24 hours is resembled exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do this.
These organisms can be able to be able to be very very quickly.
They can live under a detect.
I'm absolutely sure that life existing in space, and you slow new environments to find new environments of water.
And I mean, NASA showed that this avail.
This is a picture of the molecule that we built these approximately with the life-properly with the design of the segment of the segment of the segment of the segment of the molecule of the segment of the molecule of the molecule of the molecule of the molecule of the molecule of the seg
The life-smile automatically.
This picture was not taken with a microscope with a microscope microscope --
It's a molecule that we can see the great great that we can see the with a microscope of ready.
These are pictures that they cover a time of six seconds.
This is the publishing we did a little time ago.
They're more than 580,000 lyming code code code code here.
It's the molecule of a definitely defined structure called the man.
It's got a lot of molecular southern 300 million million ones.
If you stamp with a 10 without spaces, we would like 142 pages would like 142 pages to transmer this genetic code.
Now, how do we work? How can we do that?
Obviously, tramite a virus is a kid game.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria
It's simplest when it's a cell-like cells as our our our our ourselves, you can just expose the nuclear process of nailable and unserirlation is basically the process of clonation.
In the bacteria is the southern is integrated in the cell phone, but we have recently showed that we are able to do a complete trailing a cell romosome,
We purified a mountailing from a microbial microbial crowd.
The two are different as the topic of topis.
We added some gene in the way that we could decide that you can decide that for this tail.
The then skied with the inner to killer all the protects of the protects of the protects of the protects of the proteins.
And when we put it in the cell was stupending on -- and we appreciate our graphy -- the new chromosome, the new chromosome.
And we were really thinking that we couldn't go to the table, but we tried to the lought us over there.
This is one of the largest mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a little bit about a second or a third or a third third a third of a third of a few parts, I put in a second thousands of new trats of the species.
So who think about evolution as a only gene gene when you get a gene of the biologists of biology.
And there are some of the implements called the restrippioning is that admit DNA.
The tails that was in the cell of the cell is not a one.
The cellpha-tail-tail-tail-tail.
And it turns out the other chromosome, as it is expressesea as a material as a summer cell and we were returning with only the cell and the new romoune.
It became blue, because of the genes we insert.
And in a short lash of time, all the characteristic characteristic of a kind of a new software that we put in a new software that we insert in the new software that we insert in the phone.
All the protects are changed, members are changed, and when we read the genetic code -- as we have transference.
Now, this might look at genetic alchemy alchemy alchemy we can change things in a different way.
Now, I already explain that there is no talk about genesesses -- but I told us that maybe three million years and a half of evolution, and I told that we are to create a new version of Cambriana in which will be new new species on this digital process of new special explosion on this digital process.
Why do I that?
I think it's obvious when we think of our need to our need to be necessity.
We're going to go from six billion people to go to the next 40 years.
Just to give you an example.
Now there are three people on the planet for each other in 1946; in 40 years, there are going to be quattle.
We're going to find the problems now to find the water and clean medicines, medicines, medicines, and blood medicines for six billion people.
It will be still harder to do it for nove billion.
We use more than five billion carbon dials.
That means millions of barrels to the day.
When we try to find biological approach to the biological process, or a huge process of reprice, it's a huge challenge to me.
And we have to keep all the whole of the CO2 from these materials that goes into the atmosphere.
On day, thank you to the scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that they're the components for the future.
The electronic industry is just a dozen of components, and I think about how many different things are coming out of the different things are coming out.
Our limits of the limits and our reality and our imagination.
Now we have the techniques of these quickly quickly fast methization, can be able to create what we call a combinator.
We are able to build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes a day.
Think of these 20 million genes or different genes or to try to get the process of doing either or drugs or drugs and make more biologists -- we can change and create more biology -- and create more biology -- and create more biology than the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard.
We can choose for chance to survival or or carbon dixic vaccines or accepts of vaccines --
This is a few software are of some software programmed to be able to be able to be able to sell and designing species to the computer.
Well, we don't know that as they do.
We know exactly what they know is their genetic code code here.
Now we're focused on the carbon of fourth generation.
You also see you that you extend to the mix was a mouthanol experiment was a mouth.
We have a little second and third generation that will use enough to be drage at the highest carbon die of the highest value as either either flowing or different types of thrown or different types of throw or different types of throw or different kinds of throwing or or different kinds of of throwing that are going to be able to be a lot of the highest and the highest of the tape that are are going to be like the highest and the higher of the highest and the high-value of the high------
But the only way that biology can have a great impact can have a great impact of the food and limiting the cost of the food and limiting the CO2 in material in the first of the CO2 in material that we are working to design cells, and we think we could have reached this purposed, and we can have the first carbon died.
The sunlight solar with the CO2 is a metodog -- but in our discoveries in the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism that we describe in 1996.
It lives in the deep ocean to about 2,500 feet of the water.
They create meters from the CO2 using hydrogeno molecular sources.
We're trying to understand if we can inch the CO2, which can easily be transported to be translated that CO2 in carbon and carbon the switch this process.
So we just think we could be able to be able to increase what the basic question of "What is the life."
Even though you can't do it from TED, where you can?
It would be a main of energy source.
And then we're working for using the same methods to create vaccines to create vaccines in instantant antanea.
You saw this year with influence, we are always behind a year and a dollar a year when it's been to find the right vaccine the right vaccine.
I think what you can change in a combinable, in antic anticipps.
So here's how the future could start to be changing, now, the tree of evolution, accelling evolution with bacteria -- archeuctions, archeucarian actors, and infinally cells.
We are so much from improve people.
Our purpose is to do in a way of living enough to try to do this with a lot of time to try to do this very much.
First of all you to see that, the fastest -- a few things that we had to the Microsoft technology that we had to Microsoft in a year a year a year a year a year a year a year a year a year a year a very quickly year a year a very quickly.
It's about a environmental environmental where you can interact is a local level that remote with an enormous amount of data.
We're seeing a lot of the gigabyte pictures with a kind of digital pictures with a kind of zoom and continue, for a break panoramic fast panoramic images.
And not matter how big the amount of information, as big as much as much as much as the images.
Most of the digital photographs are digital photographs, but this for example is a proofing from the Bible Big Big Big of Congress, and reenter in the legal game, and reaching the legal of the Congressssles.
It doesn't make a difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in your pattern moment. It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a book of data doesn't imagine data not images.
This is Casa desolated of Dickens. Every colonna represents a capitulo.
To show you that this is just to show you that is a real thing. We can do something like this, to see that this is a real representation of the head, not of a photoe.
It could be a little artificial to read a electronic book.
I don't reach it.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian.
Every great image is the beginning of a severity.
And it gives you the very beautiful experience of reading the version of law version of a review of a review of a review of a quotidie, which is for a molecules of a molecules of a a lot of meching.
We also did something with the corner of this number in this particular number of Guardian.
We created a published advertising a high-solution -- much more than what you use in a normal publishing -- and we insert in the extraordinary content -- and we insert content -- and we put it in the ext.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific technique.
And this really demonstrate some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space.
We hope that this gentlemifies to put a few miles and other porches are to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And on this isn't going to lose time, if we didn't say that we have to give them to this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. soving a picture of NASA.
So now we're going to go to something.
This is actually from the webs; you can go to the webs; you can go to see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which fights two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer visual computer that Noah Snavely, a student of the University of Washington, with the Steve Seitz of the US and Rick Szelii of Microsoft Szelii Microsoft Resson.
And it's from the vision of the web, managed by Seadrage by Seadragon.
You can see the way we do this kind of pattern that we can go from a picture of the other experience and have this kind of experience to solve solve solution to solve solve solution in the other experience.
But the space, the space, the images here has actually been a meaning.
The visualization of the computer computer have recorded these pictures together, in the way that corresponding to the network in which you can imagine -- all sorts of the real, all of the slagers Grases Roccious Lassian Roccious electric -- you see the welems of a slide-stable slide-show of the whole whole whole space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more space.
I want to go directly to one of the Noahand, and this is from a previous prototypes of Photosynthetic data that we did it for the first time -- to show you what the rate is really the clock of the technology -- to show you what the godnth. And it's not necessarily so it is to see the environmental technology that we put the environmental --
We had to worry about the legal aspects and I said,
This is a reconstruction of the cattedral of Notary Dame images Basta Flickr Flickr in Flickr and you get pictures of the campyps, and you get images of the around, and I said, "He," a picture of these around.
So I'm all pictures of Flickr and were all connected to this space.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple way.
You know, I never thought I would be finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very free to receive this kind of accounty here.
I think you can see that this is a lot of different fourselves from those phones of the phones in the SLR, a number number of SLR, a number number of the SLR, a number of different framework with this environment.
And if you can try to find those more strange.
Most are block by facturing them.
Some part here is a series of photographs -- -- -- there is a few photographs -- -- -- -- -- you know, there is a few part of here is a few pictures --
This is a poster of Notary Dame recorded correctly.
We can go from the poster of this environmental view.
The essential point is that we can do some of the social environmental environmental environmental is actually actually actually actually actually actually a whole memory of collective -- from the world's point of view.
All those pictures are coming together, greater than the way of the sex.
You have a model of the interest that emerge.
Think about this as a promote of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual virtual Earth virtual virtual Earth virtual virtual
It's something that growing in complexity as the people who use it, and the people who uses for the uses of uses are increasing with use.
Their pictures are snurses from other people.
If you see somebody is the idea of constraight the notion of the Notary Dame of Notary Dame of the Notary Dame of all those dates, and I can use as a point of these data, and I can use as a kind of sweet for a picture of anybody else else else -- and have a whole whole whole belse, and having a social experience of whelm-model pictures, and have a whole whole baby of the typs.
Of course, a consequence of this is all the virtual models extremely elaborate of any interesting part of the earth-scale and stops from satellitary images and satellitary memory and switness.
Mille thank you.
Chris Anderson: I understood what your software will convent to do is that in a certain point, in the next years, all of the other photographs -- all the pictures in the world are going to be basically connect?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing is doing is to find it.
He's creating hyperline, if you want to do it, I imagine hyperline.
And it's doing it in the contains of imagines.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the remarkable information, seeding information that many of these pictures.
As when you do a research of images on the web, you know, a fassumer on the pay of the picture.
Now, what happens if that picture you link to all your flow picture?
So the amount of the seedity of the seedal interconnection and the amount of remarkable that is really enormous effect of the network.
CA: Blaise, it's really amazing.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the major active when you travel and a delight-today, the souse of the search is that you have no dimentyed the antic antic antic antic antic antic antic antic -- the switch in the wind, the waste of the pieces of the pleasant in the fears of plants.

the consequence of a particular constant chote that our stirs -- a lot of generations that our stirs -- a lot of generations ago.
And, of course, we all share of the essential trats.
We all hidden we all remaining.
We are subjects to return the beginning.
We need to deal with the death of death -- so we don't smit and balliams if we go and balliaming --
We all have a art.
What it is the particular rhythm of the canzone, the range of the dance of the dance of any culture.
Not matter that are the forests of the Borneo, or the following of the Voodoo of Haiti, or the South Kenya Kenya Curgal in Kenya Cural camera, or a camp camel in the heart of the Sahara Wat.
He was my journey in the desert a month ago, or a month ago, or a yak of the yak of the world of the world of the world.
All these people are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking about there are other ways of thinking about other ways of you can move in the world.
And, if you reflects a time, is a concept that can give you hope to give you a hope --
Inside, employed the cultures of the world creating creating a spiritual spiritual and cultural cultural ral life and it's important for the planet as the biosphic biosphe.
And you can think about this ragnatela as a plane of a netnosfer and you can call the thnosfast of all of the conceptions of all the conceptions of the human consciouss, intuitions that were from the imagination of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciously.
The etnosfast of human human human human human issue.
It's the symbolic of what we are and what we can be in how much unquisitive.
And I suddenly consumed as a biospherant was very quickly to the nyspherase and untained too quickly.
No biology, for example, it would be the 50-percent of all species was or is the extension of the summer -- or -- in the most apopoor -- in the most apopoor potterm -- and you don't have close to the most optimistic -- and you don't have closer -- that differently optimistic -- that differently the cultural diversity --
The indicates of all is, of course, the language language.
When you're born 6,000 lings, they were 6,000 lings.
One language is not just a vocabulary or a series of gragramatical rules.
One language is the pray of the human spirit of human spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the human spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the human spirit.
It's the half of which animals in the material is in the material in the material world.
Every language is a forest, a smart of mine, a skin, a magazine chance.
And those 6,000 languages, as we are here in Monterey, at least half is not more sussurrying in the ears of kids.
They don't get to kids, the which means less than the camp, which is not a skie, which are already death --
What is the most tristairs of the silence of the last to talk a language, of the last to talk a language, of the site of the ancestors, or of the ancesticipate the promise of the kid?
This orrying was a few few weeks of the world every two weeks a few weeks a weeks a little bit of the last few weeks and door and door and door and a language of an antic language.
And I know that somebody who you say "Is it better like that?
The world would be a better place if we were all the same language of the same languag?" Well we all all yoruba.
We talk about kogi.
You know, you can see a tract thing that means not to talk about language.
I would like to do a journey through the ethnosfer.
a little journey in the etnosfer of what we're loss are losing.
Many of us dimentioning that when I say "different ways of existing existing different ways of there.
Let's take for example, this bimb Barasana, in Amazony Sep, the population of anacony of anacony, which creates the site of the sepents in the sacries.
It's a population that is not able to distinguish the blue color because the celests is identified in the forest, which they dipend in the forest, which dipends the population.
They have a strange language and a rule rule -- "exogamy languages.
All of this has rooted in the pastological past, yet is that in these family are in which are talking about six or seven seven lings, no nobody language of the mysteries of mysterious language.
They just listen to the and then they start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived Waorororani Ecuador noral tribe, a population of the Ecuador norrow.
In 1957 five miles have tried to a conflict --
They made from the high photographs that they were used to be in a few that they were loved with loved forests that this population of the forests of pluvial forest.
They collect the pictures from the ground, they were looking at the search or a shape or a flowing -- they had been concloud, and they killed the five mission with the lance.
But the Waorani don't have only the straniera.
They killed between them.
54 percent of the death was caused by their stessi.
We are slow to eight generations and we found two natural death cases and when we put it for saper, they lost for saper, they loved it for them was invected to be agreed to the same thing that was in invective, and then they killed it it was a knowledge of the forest.
The clearers were able to recognize the animals from 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the first '80s, I was assigned a really interesting when my lessor of Harvard Leshard me if I wanted to go to Haiti to me Haitititself to be in the basis of Duvalie and Twon Macouts and Tonton Macoutes, and he sessed to make the zombie.
To send a myray sense I had to understand the Vodoun and Voodoo and that Voodoo is not a black black there.
It's quite a metaphor of the world.
Most interesting.
If you ask me to tell me the great religions of the world, what would I say, what would you say, "What would I say,

What makes you interesting your life is the intentered between life and more.
So you have to be hidden the spirit.
The spirits can be aged by Grande Aqua, respond to the dance of dance and they replaced the site of the vision of the vision of the vision that for a short time to a short that is the following the die.

In a drug continent -- this population was never conquicked from the spagnot.
And then they have government from a clack of clack but their formation is actually extraordinary extraordinary --
The young following the family and three or four years, and they live in a few years, and they live in a world world of a good world that you woot for 18 years.
To time of the nine years of proposing the nove months of the management that translate the mestor of the mother, now are metaphor Mad.
For all of this time, they are acculturing to their society, values that they presell their preice and only their praise and they praise the equilibrium -- or to say the equipment -- or to say the equipment of the pbriecological equipment of their society,
And in terms of this incredible beginning, they suddenly brought and the first time in the age of 18 years, they see a treatment of the first bely. And in that actimeet the first balls of the beautiful balls of the beautiful beauty is really all that they learned in the theory is really really really that they learned in the construct of his splending a past -- and he said, "
"Vist? Proprio like I detail.
It's stupend. Now it's a bun."
They call the largest frats and say that we are the minds, we are the colpeful of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think about the populations and the environmental environmental and the environmental story of the noble noble noble noble -- which is a concept of the noble or magazary in his simplicity or maybe we call Thoreau and we say, these popular popular popular Earth of us.
The popular population is not feeling nastonies from our our our our our our us.
There's no space for these things in the malarian Asmat or the gelies of Tibet, but thank you to return and ritions, they created a mystic of Earth based on the concept of the Earth -- the most underneath of the most underneath the most underlesson that the Earth can live for the most substanti: the concept that the Earth can live because it's infraise of human conscious:
What does it mean that?
It means that a kid of the And Ande that the world's mountain is a spirit Apu that will be a human destine will be a human band will have a human beings and will have a duntable relationship with the world that respect to be a little bit of the Montana a -- which is a tagain that creating monagy is a southern moon to be a sent mountain is a set.
That is the death of a spirit or a clearly relevel.
What is interesting is that is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and natural world.
I grew in the forests of the Columbia Britannica creating that the forests were cuted.
And that has required me to be a fun from my friends Kwautl that believe the forests are the forest of Hukukukukukukuk and the spirits that live on the world, the nurges that live on the world, the wild of the world, spirits that they deal with Hukuamatsa.
If you start to look that these cultures can actually create different reality, you can start to understand some sense. We make a lot of sensely sensely sense.
I went to this picture to open the nordoctors in the nordoctor.
Maybe some of you have heard of the ayahuase, the most powerful substance of the repertorio of the repertorio --
What makes the fascinating airplane is not the potential that is not the potential to the substance, but his elaboration. It's composed to two elements.
From a land, this lian lexian of carbon beta-carboline, harmine and harmine moline, layery and molecules, and a mold baby --
I take the only piant site was a bluewer that alters a little bit of the consciousness of a little bit of coffee of a ccaffee of a falling arbuster in the coffee of the coffee revious family reviviral and reviriding it to the sous.
This piant potent triptages that triptune, very simiar to serotonine, dithoxyptydithoxydithoxydithoxydithoxyptes.
If you ever see the Yanomami tyring for the nose nose that they do from a species, anchoxydithoxydithoxydithoxydithoxydithoxydithoxydithoxydithoxydithoxydit for the nose of the nose of the site site to the Yanomami in the site of the slydithoxype.
Tiring that poles on the nose is a little bit like being gone from a slump of the cell box, and land land land on a sea a sea distortion of electricity. It doesn't believe the reality of reality of reality, recreates of reality of reality.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who has taken the man of the Spsychchchchchchickens in the '30 in Mexist.
I think my text can be classing these tripting tripty because if you're done not to be a lot of belucintained to be a bunch of being loved because they are dynamed because they are dynamed because they are actually dynamed to be in the intestined in the inter that you find in the intestimated --
It's possible to assume -- it's just if you put it with other substances that denly denaturing the MAO.
Now is the beautiful beta-carbon dioxide are started, in this booana are the MAO, the same kind of potential for the triptamines available tript: in a four-species of 80,000 species of plants, how these populations are not a million diologists of the sees of the sure, but that if you combined a version of the suit?
We use the great eufemisism and error, which can reveal infruttifer.
But if we ask India, they will tell us "CEElant."
What does it mean that?
This tribe, the Cofan, has 17 variety of ayahuase, which distinguished in the forest, and that our eyes would be in the same species.
If we ask how to stablize their poccracks will tell you about plants, "I really really don't know everybody?" I said, "No."
The solution, is the 17 variety in a night of a land, each other.
With this is not laureed to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than containing stams.
Now, the problem is that the problem is that also the ones of us that have to the details are in the Indian history, but in some way you get the marges of the history of the history of the real real world to our real real world --
In fact, in the XX century, 300 years, not will recall the wars or its innovations of technologies or its innovations of technologies -- but rather like it was where we stopped and we fly accepted the destruction of the diversity and cultural destruction of the planet.
All cultures through the centers were involved in a dance for new possibility of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indian Sioux have not been seed to be Sioux when they put from the arm and fresh and fresh them as Americans have been part of Americans when they put it from the horse horse and calculations.
It's not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of the etnos;
The late fly of the domination.
And if you give a skid to the world, you find that these are not culture destined to disappear.
They're creatures and dynamic and dynamic force to identify that will be over the adaptation of adaptation of adaptation and dynamed it from the existing of the identified and dynamics.
I think you know, you know, I think about Penanches in the pathries of Penans,
a popular notion of Sarawak, in the sound of the Soul Cinese has lived to a generation of the forest, and now reduced the degree of the reversion and reference in the reference of the fights in the fume in the fixed of the Merious Cinese Meria, where the nararrom Meridion, where the narrowing the naves of the navail.
I just just return the stairs with the subtract with the forest.
Oppppure, in the Yanomami, are the diseases that are come with the discovery of the earlier of the ear.
If we move on the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of searching the Tibet, you see the last voltion of political domination.
As you know the genocidie, the extension of a popular popul, but the universal level, but the wild of the universal style of the style, not only is not not not only condition is not not not not only condition of the environmental strategic strategic strategic of the development of the development.
And you can't understand the Tibet of Tibet until you start the beginning.
I loved the 6,000 miles from China in China Western China in the Western Tibet in Lhasa a young line, but only come come to Lhasa a young line, but only come to Lhasa statistics that we heard statistics that we heard about it.
60,000 monuments in the poles and energy.
1.2 million people killed by the Cultural Right?
The father of this kid was ascritical to Panchen Lama.
The one that means that it was killed to the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion that was killed to the Chinese --
Senter was the Santity in Santity during the diaspora that has taken the population in Nepal.
Her mother was imprisoned and her colpe.
It was brought to the age of two years from the age of two years from his gonna because it could not have to be able to be without him.
The surprise, which has done it in the reedure.
A day he was a fashion a fashion the Mao and the Mao and a transgression, was actually actually put it for seven years.
Tibet of Tibet can be inabable, but the spirit of the population is from ten.
And then it turns out to the whole brought a choice.
What do we want to live in the world of the monotony world we want to get the policyromatic world of differity?
The great antiantic antiantic antiantianti-year-old man said that his largest fairly in our world -- in our world is that in our world is going to see the world, not only see the human imagination of human imagination in the human imagination of thinking about the human though, but a day we can see that there was other possibilities.
And it's humiliate that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neoliter's revolution that made us the agriculture, which made us to be the cular cular culture of the seed-year-old cular of the clerarchy of the clerate of the specialization of specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern world of the industry world has been 300 years.
And that is not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we should deal with millennia.
When you see these measaiss of cultures of the world is asked to be humans, respond to be humans, responding to be humans,
And it's in these answers that we all save the chance of being what we are.
I went to this picture of the north of the East East Baffin, when I went to the balloes of the balene with Inuit, and this man, Olaya, he told me the wonderful story of his grandmother's wonderful talk.
The government government government was not always gentlessing with the Inuit and the '50 to be able to be our preptious sound, we have required in colonies.
The grandmother of this man was refied to go to the us.
The family for her life, he took all the armile, and all its attributed all its attreps.
You must know that Inuit not temes the fredent -- the site slu.
The slity of the slittles were made of fishing caribs.
The grandmother of this man didn't fit from the night of article or the belelelsesed.
It's sgattoled the pantaloned the pantalones in the shelf of his hand. When the defected in their hand. When I made it creating a lam.
It has been salive on the points of this cacce and when they come to solve a son.
He went to school, and created a brillier, with the glass -- and he made a slittle, and he sleeped another song and it has gone on the wheeethy of the game in the south.
And this is the resilience with nurging with night-hairs -- in different ways, the symbols of the world population of the world population of the world.
In the 197, 1999 government government has redied to Inuit in the total control of a total area of California and Texas a major area of the Texas a mouthern areas.
It's their new found. It's called Nunavut.
It's a territory.
One splending example of a national as a national national national can recognize with his population.
And, in the end of us is quite obvious than us was in these remote areas, to realize that there are not not really fairly in the real way.
For somebody is home.
They have a few selections of human imagination that are rising at the tempies. And for us all these kids, as the southern swels of our children's wisdom -- they become part of the hope of the hope of the hope of the hope of the hope of the hope of the hope of the hope of the human image.
And we finally get National Geographic we are convince that political will never come to swimming swimming.
We believe that the polemicy --
[Applausive, it's not losssssous, but we believe that the stories can change the world, and maybe we have the best institution, to tell stories of the world.
156 Paesesis they put our television --
Our several of millions of people.
Our work is travel to get our audience in the nest-based places in the places that they go to the middle of which they go to the middle of the central revealing of the central revealation of the central of the central of the central of the central of the diversity of the differently of the world in a pluralist living.
where the sagges of all the population can contributing to our benefit to our benefit to our benef.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope I heard that I heard and provide some line, in case not notitors.
I want to start with what I call "the official."
The office official of thing?
The official official society of all the industrial society is the official official official societies, "If we want to be of our city, "If we want to do it is to do it is to do it is to be a lot of deal."
The reason I stand from a late, in the fact that freedom is the same value, is useful, essential for humans.
On the other is in the fact that if we liberate, each of us can act to do everything that massive our benefit of our benefit without any deciding in our name.
The way to massive freedom is to be massive massive choice.
More choices people are had, and greater is their freedom, more and it's their freedom,
This is so deeeth, it's so much radically radicated in societies, you know,
And it's also deeply in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has reefly possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big.
I lose a simple note on the conditional condiments for insane.
In my supermarket is 175 conditions, without containing the 10 variety of the extract late and 12 acets, which you can buy a huge number of balloloes that you can buy a huge number of constant constant circumstance that nobody is to your degrade is to your degrade of your degrade is to your departy.
That's what the supermarket.
And then you go to the uncable, to buy a stereo: casses, reading a stereo, the CD, radio, plast, radio --
And in this single store, there's a great number of electronic components --
We can make six million and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in a negotil.
You have to put that there's a lot of choice.
Some of communications.
And one time, when I was a kid, they could get all the telephonic telephonic telephonic phones, and they were forced by mom Bell.
He was the telephone, you don't get it to bought it.
One consequence of that, between the other, was that telephone is that telephone is a making.
These are the temptions of gone.
Now we have a lot of almost illimitated phones, specially between phones, specially between cellular cellular phones --
Here the future.
My favorite is to be in a meche, reading MP3, cut, and forechnology for the cratic cryms.
If you don't have seen in the store, you're not seen in the store, you're pretty much certain you will be there.
And what the end is that people are in the negoties and this question is the answer? The answer is the answer? The answer is the answer?
It's not possible to buy a phone that doesn't do too much things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than water, you know, the same explosion of choice.
Assistence is not going to happen.
I went from the doctor, and the doctor, "You could do -- "B" -- "B" -- "B" has these benefit" and these skills. What do you want to do that?"
He says, "Dr. Dr. what would you do that?"
And the doctor, "A has these benefs and these risks, and By has these benefit."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you rebit, "Dr. if she was me, what do you do to do that?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not lei."
The result of the malato," expression that it looks like a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not to move the fish and responsibility of the understanding of the decisions from somebody knows that something, you know anything -- and almost certainly it's not not in the condition.
There's a huge marketing markets, direct products -- I would say to people like me and you, that if you think not any sense, that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, because they do them with them and they are the public public public public --
The answer is that they want to do that we call the doctor, to ask us to change the recepty.
And so that we have to be our identity as we have a question of choice, as you see in this journey -- "We don't want to force the kids.
And we can reinvented us how many times we can reinvent.
The one morning, you have to deal with the risk, you want to be able to be able to be able to be.
I retreated to the family and matrimoney, a time time the perspective, unusual perspective, and it was that there was a more prevely possible -- and it was going to be able to get the most prevent as well.
The only real choice was with checked, and not as I don't even even know what what do later.
Over day, all of this is really to play it.
I mean, I go to a very smart students, and they 20 percent in less than a time time I work at least a time.
And not because they are double, not because they're less diliging.
But why are you implement, I mean, I should I smit me or nothing? I should I do this right now, I would you do this right now.
"Would I smit me late? I had to think before the children or the carrier?"
I'm interrogatives of logic love.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implement, even if this implementing the companies that you assegment to my exame.
And they really have to do it. I'm questioning this.
Now, the job: we are lucky, as Carl underground, because technology allows us to work every minute, every day, from the Hotel Randel Randph.
To parentesi, there's a corne, and I didn't tell any any any quale, where the WiFi WiFi works.
I don't tell you, because I want to use it.
What does it means, this incredible freedom that we have about the job? Is it we need to work in any moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son today, with cell phone, with the cell phone, Blackberry in the other, and the nights, and the night-eyed tebook, typically, about the knee.
And even though I have a little bit of the gentlate that we see our son ggo, "Do you know, I have to answer this called the has?"
"Do I have to answer this email? I have to get this literap?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the head-hold experience of your son son son son son son was in other conditions.
So, we see something we look at the little big, things and stils and stils of life, life is a question of choices.
Of the world was this: Ovo, there were some possibility, but not all of the possibility, but it was not a little choice.
The world today is a good good thing -- the dilemma is a positive thing, or negative, or negatives?"
The answer is Spack.
The positive of the positive we all know about the negative ones of the negative ones of the negative ones of the negative of the negative launched of the negatives of the negatives of the negatives of the negatives of the negatives of the negatives of the negatives of the negatives of the negative lays.
All this choice is two real-concerned reality on the people.
The first one, paradossleeping is that fresh freation.
With many options between the way that chcheap and becomes very hard to do this.
I offer to give you a meaning for a meaning on the planes of flife-based on the planets.
A line, a line, and a giant data from Vancer, the giant society with about a million clients with about a million companing clients in 2,000 companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are come to more than any 10 solutions that are over 24 percent.
With 50 found, there's 10percent in less than adedesions when they are available to when they are available to be available to just 5. Why do that?
Because with 50 founds the ones that chcheap is very hard to decide and choice is actually actually actually actually remainly to the question.
And I wonder and I still ask questions, and of course, questions, and of course, the questions don't get there.
You know, you can't just mean that these work from old old old from the old of the people are going to say that the decision is so much of the decision is so obstant that even the foundation of the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator of the works.
Not speak, they're losing to 5,000-dollars for the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator device.
So the paralize is a consequence of having too much choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And for the ethernityym: ketchchecketchese?"
You would be the right decision -- if it's for the fairnity, right?
You don't want to take the wrong found, and you nepat the wrong.
So this is the first effect of the second is that if we can avoid paralyming and make a choice, we actually actually actually actually actually made from the results of the results of the flowing of which you were able to be able to avoid that we were able to avoid parality.
And this for several reasons.
One of these is that with many conditions that you could have a different choice, if you buy a and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you could have been better than you could have been better a different choice that you have been better than the imagined us and reduce the reduce of the choice, and rempiant the reduce of the confident of choice, and reduced the defection of the surgery of the condition of the confidition of the conduction of the conduction of the deffitting conduction of the stication of the site of the surgering of the
even when it was a good decision.
More choices us are easy to any details of any details that is insound of the option of the option of the option of the option of the option.
And then there's what economists call it expensive economists.
Dan Gilbert has very well stamator as the value value we do things from what we do to things that we confronti.
Del the way, when there are many options possible -- is to be the options of the alternative alternative alternative to the option of the option that you can be choice.
Here's an example. I have all those who are not New York.
But that's what you probably think about it.
There's this copy to Hamptons.
A place of the luse.
Spivels splendid.
Not anything. But what he thinks it is: "Well, malediation, is Agsto."
"Everybody my neighbors in Manhattan are in the vid."
"I could go to the right right in front of home."
And I spent two weeks and the idea that is losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where you want to be a little bit of a parking --
The expensive opportunity to dimine the soddisfation for what we have, when the choice was excellent --
And more are the options that we have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be as a cost-opportunity.
Here's another example.
This journey says a lot of things.
And it is the moment, and maybe the live of the living slowly.
But the most important point is that you can check up with not doing the other.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of attracties that can make less attactive what we do.
Third points that spiral growing of expectance.
I tried to my site bought a new jeans.
I was almost always jeans.
And once the jeans were a type of just a little where, and they were sweet and they were sweet -- they were sweet them all were able to go good.
So I went to buy a couple of the old when the old old old old -- and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cut."
The committed said, "Li want slim fit, fit, fit, fit, and fit, fit, and fit it up in the fit?"
Do you want to the cernic or with the bottonies?
"Who want to be the stres?"
"Well it want to be a stret? Blland,
I was skid, and after a little bit of a little bit -- which was the only guy -- which was the only typopo" -- that was not what I tried to the whole staff of the negotities, then the negoties, then the negoties, and the best jeaneans, with the best jeans that I had ever had been done.
It was the massive bous. With all the meet meet the late meet.
But I felt I felt about it.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worse is that I was that with all the choice were waiting my waiting were there.
And I was waitative minime. I didn't expect to be perfectly, when I was just a type of a type, but when I lived a little bit of a little bit of a be.
What I had watched was good, but not perfect.
After I paragoned to what I was looking at the same time.
The add of options in the life of people don't make the options that these are respect to the options of the options itself.
And this will be less soddisfation, even when the results are good at the results are good for it.
No one in the world of marketing if they make it.
Because if you know what I'm talking about.
The truth resembly much of this.
"It was better when he was worse when he was worse, the reason I was going to be worse is that when you were worse, I wouldn't met of the premise of the premise of the prevous surprise of please.
Over the world we live -- the world we live -- opulationalized citizens with the perspective, the mayption -- the mayster that we can hope is the treatment of waiting itself.
You never have to be surprise because you are expectance, my waite, and I expectance, you know, my waite.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- "Basas" "Yes, you want to be way."
I mean, little time -- the authorical moment -- which I'm really smission and my wife is really stupendy.
I couldn't do better, I didn't do it, I don't have to do better.
But they don't always get to be a good thing.
And finally, a couple of jeans smote a couple of jeans smote when you have that kind of jeans is that when you're not sodying, and you ask "Why do you say, "Why do you say, "Why do you say, "Why do you say, "Why do you say, "Why do you you do that?"
Who is responsile?"
The world is the responsible. What could I do about that?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insound income, and you ask you who is responsible to the responsible is the responsible for you you're there.
You could do better.
With hundreds of variety variety variety for the insuccess.
So when people take a decisions, even though the result is valid, you feel incomfortable and they give the color they can be.
In the last years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world
I think a meaning -- not the universe -- not the universe -- of this depression is that people have experiences, because the standard are too much of the standard are too alone.
And when they have to explain this situation I think, is them.
So the final result is that in general is that in general general, but we feel worse.
Let me tell you about it.
This is the official dog; what we all take for good and it's completely failed.
There's no doubt that a little choice is better than you have to have a little choice that doesn't have a little choice is better than a pound,
There's a critical value -- I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have been able to a piece of the level where the choices can improve our life.
Now, from the political point of the political point of the policy point of policy is the following.
What it allows this all of the industrial society is the remarkable material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about that, in which which the problem is not that they have too much choice.
The problem is that they have too much a little bit of it.
So the factors I'm talking about is a maler mallow mallow to the modern of modern society.
And what it does to do is this: Steve Levitt has talked about the isons of the constted seats and scomoes are useful for bibes are inequals are useful.
I mean, these choice, complicated and dispendiose, is not just just inuseful --
I'm deleteries.
They make worse worse.
If you have a little bit of what in our societies allowed it to be reversed in those where people have too much possibility, it would be not only their life to improve but also the nostrength.
This is what economists, the economists, they call a a paretian improvement paretianother.
And a redition of the redition of the redition of the redition -- because of this choice in except that we go.
To conclusion, "Foe, you can become everything that you want.
Vooes, people of culture, I think, "What makes that fish?"
"It's obvious that you can't do anything in a vetrow of vetrow wis."
"A picture of the fally."
and I went out of this -- I interpretated this to begin.
But then I realized that the weight I realized that that fish.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you managed the boccire, in a way that "everything is possible," you don't really really really good paraly."
If you go the bock in a way that all become possible dimine of the satisfation.
Acceuring paralyes, and you reduce the benef.
They need a sfer.
This is almost certainly too stret, maybe even even fish, and they safe for us.
But the explores of some symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic for the infelicity of a bunch of the slummmpic symbol
Thank you very much.
