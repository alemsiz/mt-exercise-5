The year I showed these slide of the slide to demonstrate that the calculus for three million years has had the size of 48 million years has been restrettten from 40 percent.
At this underlying the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show it not show the sky of the ice of ice ice ice as ice of the ice of ice ice as the ice of ice problem because it doesn't show it it in the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of ice because it doesn't show it it is not show it that the ice of the ice ice ice of the ice.
The glacial glacial artic is in a certain sense, the heart of global climath climath of global climath of global climath of global climath climath of global climath of global climate.
You get the wind and wind and returns out of the winds.
The next next delilight will be a rapid carlled on the last 25 years.
The ice enough is drawed in red red red red there.
As you see it down to the blue swood.
This is the ice in inver, which is the wind of the windner in the winds.
You can see that the ice ice ice called the ice ice ice ice ice ice loenness, is like the blood like like the body.
In 25 years was spent about this, like like this.
This is a problem because the interested in the earth, the earth, where there are huge quantities where there are enormous amount of carbon and and done hand and they turn into metans from the microbe.
It respect to the totality of the atmosphere from global scale of global warming of the sources could radouble this point of not returned out out of this point of not return out to the point of the totality of the global inquinition to the totality of global warming of the totality would be able to the sky of the skill this po
In some of the ska little deep in Alaska hot of the water.
The professored professor, Katey Walter of Alaska is recated team is recated with a team of the bottom.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: He's good. The question is if you will also even even now.
A reason is that this terms of the growth of the northern Greenland from the northern Greenland from the northern Greenland is that the ground of the norther.
This is a glacial regime
And he had never reached the similar levels.
This is the physical guy in the so-like obest Greenland of the Greenland of the Genland
If you want to know how the level of the level of the ice to the sky of the ice ice on terrafer, here is where it is where it is where it is where it is where it is where you get to sea basic level of the leap of the sky to the sky of the ice ice ice ice to the slight on the level of the ice ice to the slight on the mare.
These rents are increasing increasing.
An the other of the planet: Antarcts, the largest block of the planet.
The last month last month have dichiared that the bunch of the ice ice is in negative, and that the Antarts, and that Antarcticularly on some hyslands under the sunlight in the ske.
It was like six feet at six feet of water as Greenland in Greenland in Greenland in Greenland.
Himalaya, the third largest block of ice block and you see new aghistor, who were glacia.
The 40 percent of the world's population recognize of what I mean.
Here And: This yargue is the source of this city.
The door is increased.
But when you diminum the same across the same across the water.
In California has on the Sierra Nevada is diminured in the 40 percent.
The ydynices are in crisis.
The predictions, like you have a lot of the prediction.
The growing growing in the world door a night eventually in the world of the well.
The disaster disasters are increasing a recorded out of the normal and without precedent.
Four flight times more number in the last 30 years of the previous 75.
This is a whole thing of the instainable gainable gain.
If you look at the context of the story if you can see the consequence.
In the last five years we add 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the time, the area of the oriental Pacific American exts, and on the subject of the continent of the continent of the continent of the continent of the oxygene in the oceans.
Most of global warming of global warming deforestation, which is 20-century is the usual combusticstic.
Oil is a problem, and the carbon is a problem, and the carbon is even worse
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions, together at China.
And it turns out of the ballots of carbon of carbon
But we're going to be a changing change.
These are the projects of annonothing in the last few years of the versus of the version.
At every way, there's a political lotty in our country.
The carbon industries and oil industry have 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon to promote the carbon and is a host hoxy-hox.
This image me remind me --
Nath Natan, in the Tennesse, where I was a 3.8 billion middle of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of the Tennessee, where I live Nath and a lot of carbon of carbon of carbon of carb.
Maybe you saw the news.
This is the second largest fleat at at the America.
It's happened around Natal.
The published natalized non-bought industry was this one.
Video: I mean, Frosty is a ball of happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty carbon is more and more and more and more and more and more clean hundred.
It's about good price, adorables and workers and hands himpen.
Al Gore: Do's here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The largest society on the world's minerary minerary is Massey Coal. This is the amministrator.
Video: Don Bland S: I'll be ask -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelogo, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for Proteon the Clim has launched two campaign.
This is a essential one of it.
Video: Actor: At COALer's see changes like a minm of the minm as a minm of our business.
And so our priority is invest a great amount of money in a public sform, and confuses and confuses the true true of the real balance.
In fact, the carbon is not spor.
We think it's a good -- has a good properse.
So not precupated,
Let me do not.
Video: Actor: Carbon--- you heard -- you heard about a lot of talking about a lot of so.
So we do a girl in a frameworks.
Straordinary machines are a little romoross, but this is the sound of charbong.
The carbon is in the main of the main the main the main the main charbong, but the notice of the carbon that you see change.
You look at a ey: this is the gooddness of carbon of carbon
Al Gore: Inden finally, the slide is a national slight-up up to the national security and that of the national security and that of the national security.
Video: H: Liky is in crisi; the economy, the national security climatic.
The film that the flight all of the World dependence from the combustic and the important, like the carbon and the important oil and the important oil is the important oil.
Now, there's a new audge of audition to us.
America. Let me have a little bit of energy in the years.
They like to reput the America to work on work, maintains and help the global scale of global warming.
And so it is a solution that basts to resolve our problems.
By America. Scopy more.
Al Gore: This is the ultim.
Video: H: It's about to reach energy in America.
One of the faster of the faster of the dependence from the combustic dependence from our planet.
And, I talk, the future is here. I mean, a new remarkable energy network.
She talks about 2: Novi investment for places of well.
All right. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old webs: If you want to go to speed to the sun.
If you want to go away to go away together."
We need to go away to go away at the time.
Thank you very much.
The year at TED phecks a introduction on LHC.
And they go back to the car to get to the car on how the machine.
So what the other one of the other time that the other time is not there was the biggest experiment that the great experiment that -- 27 miles of skilometers of circumstered -- 27 kilometers of circumster of circumstance.
Her became up to realize the conditions that were less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times to 600 million times a second.
All is just the environment.
This is the car under Gineva.
We picture these mini-Big Big Big Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Bang Big Bang Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Bi
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is larger 44 feet and has a 22 feet of 22 feet and has a 22 feet of feet of 22 feet and has a 22 feet of half to the 22 feet and has a 22 feet of a 22 feet of 22 feet and has a 22 feet of feet of 22 feet and has a 22 feet of 22 feet and hours to feet and it has a 22 feet of feet in 22 feet of feet and hour.
This is a spaces of ATLAS in building so you can notice proportions.
The 10 settember of the last year we have access,
And this picture was taken from ATLAS.
It was because of immenses in the control.
It's a picture of the first physical image that had all been in the LHC, ring in collision, deliberated, with a part of the LHC, and difficult particle in the LHC, and difficult particle in the reevator.
In other words, when we see that picture the 10 10 settember the machine, we see that the machine, which is a great liftype that is a great liftype of the machine.
I don't know if it was to do you exact out of the time when somebody went to Google and saw that the beginning was this one.
What means we had a cultural impact impact of what scientific impact.
About a week later, it was a problem with the machine, and it had to these films here -- these movies here -- these movies -- these movies -- these files.
These are 13,000 prints when the machine works at the massive powerful of power.
Now, technical technical technical and say, "It's not true. It's not true. It's not too much under there.
And they can do it because when they're very fresh cosids become cosids.
So, at least 271 degrees, at a time of the space between the stars, these movies can bring that corrent.
In one of the yellow jundle between LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the movies are going to read laws read light. And 13,000 printing a electrice.
This was the resulted.
Now, this is still more impression, if you think these magnets are moved than 20 tons of 20 centimeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to be taking a tough of what we did it.
We have been relied.
They're going back to the whole place in the ground.
Entrue of the LHC is going to be new intes:
We accenate it, and we wait to get the data of data to get the data or him, and keep it to find how our wind that are the matts that are the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain the way, these puts returned the dibact of science and the engineering of science, and the engineering.
I think the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think this value value of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the words of a scientist, Humphrey Davy, which is what the inuses of inuseful inuseful experiments of his broke, the one was Michael Farad, said, "No it is so dangerous, you know, it's so dangerous to the progress of human mind as the ideas that ideas that are not about our trigger than our trigger tries that are not in nature of nature,
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about here, from the kids, you know, kids, you play the kids,
And as you realize them and reach them and realized them and realized them and realizing them and resolving them and resolving problems and resolving problems and hands and relationship to space and relationship to space.
The space is deeply is deeply connected to the way in the world around us.
So, by information information of our interaction with physics, together in my consults, and my consults, and my collaboratory to my collaborator Jeevan Kalanith, I started asking a computers, and if you use a computerer, instead of the mouse of the mouse as police, and we can read a falling information with a little broke, and to be a little bbrother, and sentency with bottom,
and it turns out our plentence?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided to explore the answer, building Siftable.
In point, a Siftable computer is a whole whole thing as a big discover.
In point, a Siftable computer is a whole whole thing as a big discover.
You can move with the hand, they can see the ske, and they can see the ske, and they have a sharing wireless.
But above all, I'm physics, like the matter matter is to move to be able to realize it.
The Siftable are the example of a new ecosystem of information for information.
And as they become more physics, consciouss, and as the way, of the others, and as they become more physics, and as they become more physics, of the others, like the others, as we can exploring new and fun and fun and fun and fun to interact new stiles and all different stilds of interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This is configured to show the video sk: if you including the video it will be in a direction, if you including the other side of the other side of the other side back.
These are the whole thing about others.
If they are interested in the business what they are interested in the him.
If they come circumdata, and they can agring a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of them.
If they come circumdata, and they can agring a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of them.
They also true their movement and inclination.
We realized that one of the interesting thing about the interaction was the power to use gestures in the data, to be like a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured secks and I can use them to be able to the color, where you must use them in the central where they mix down.
and I can use them to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to use them in the central color.
If we really get too much later, we can reput a little bit of place.
They are also beautiful chance of apple, as the language, the mathematics and games of logical and games where people can try and see the results.
I'm going to --
This is a Fibonaction of Fibonaction that I do with a program of equations.
This is a game of words that is to put between Scarabeo and Boggle.
Pratically, in every turn in the house of the house on every Siftable, Pratically, to every road, and all the house on every house on every Siftable, and as you try to get words.
Then, after about 30 seconds remissing a new set of setting and new chance and new possibility to try to try to read and new possibility to try to read and new chance to try to read and new chance of them.
Thank you.
Here's the kids came to the Middle Lab, I did it in Lab, and I got them a video.
They are pleased a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of education.
You just say, "Wonto the words, and they know what to do.
Here's other people who tries it.
This is our younger head, there is the younger head.
It really wanted to be implant.
They just were only him.
Now, this is a charty of a interactive cards.
We wanted to build a tool for appreciation of the Lui is Felix.
And then you can inserve new characters in the scene, and they were slowing Siftable to their associats.
And then you can inserve new characters in the scene, and they were slowing Siftable to their associats.
So it's doing the sun.
Video: The sole is sun.
David Merrill: Now has taken a treat in the scen.
Video: The treat the year.
Bel work!
So schooling Siftable and put the neighbors can interact the people --
Video: Bau!
-- and by inventing their story.
Video: Ca!
DM: It's a story with open-open-up as you know.
DM: It's a story with open-open-up as you know.
Video: Vole,
DM: The last example I have the time to show you is a tool, to field and exech and exeguy and exeguy and exeguy to exech music.
It's a tool, realized recently, to field and exeguy and exeguy
The Siftable here is based on the basic and battery.
Each one of these has four different variation, and you can choose what you use to use to use to use it.
You can inserve these sound these sound sequence of the floor of the food and your food or or of the food sequence.
And modified it just by doing a sound "sound a "sound sequence."
These are actually that you can control from live and the reverse and the filter.
And you attack a particular and then including the sky and then including it.
And then there are the general effects like time and volume, which is apply to the whole sequence.
Look at how it work.
Video: DM: We will start a base in two Siftly," we put it in a seriously. We add in a serious serious thing, we add the other base.
Now on a bunch line.
Video: D: On it add the type --
Video: DM: And I'll put the movie to the bacteria, so I can control the effect from live.
Video: DM: I know about the whole sequence of the time from one side or the time from one or the other.
Video: H: And now I'm going to add the movie to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombining the sequence.
So I didn't planning the first one, but I can try and make it along longer or more than it or more corts.
And now, finally, I can get the whole sequence in the left squence in the left of the left Siftable to the Siftable to the Siftline of the left sks.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is build new manuface, more more and more more more than our brain workers as our brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results, and some possibly possibly possibly to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to transmit you is that is going to be going to interact with the digital objects to interact with the digital media is in our world that we want to do it.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the now to talk to you about all of you.
It's a writer writing.
Scare of the books is my profession, but it's more than that.
It's also the love and the fasascine of my life.
And I didn't expect that can change it.
But he said this, something that was happened to be recently in my life and in my careera, which taken me to realibring the whole thing with this work.
And the particular thing I recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Ama" -- Amakes the day, Ama" -- -- for some reason in the world and become a big sensition of the world and become a big sensitial feel, bestseller interational sensational.
And the result is that everywhere you were all everywhere to me as if they were convicted.
It true -- convict!
They have to be able to me and saying, "You don't have pursue, "You don't have purpose?
You don't have puts to keep writing everybody who can be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to make somebody to be able to get somebody to be able to get to one of this?
that it can be important to somebody who can you do this?
It's rashion, you know.
But it could go worse -- I was going to remind that I remind that I was a adolescent -- I was a adolescent -- I was a adolescrazy.
I meet it in the same based on the same based on the country.
And people said, "Don't you can't get to be able to be able to succeed?
You don't fear that the upon upon the rifires of kill?
You don't have puts to do this mestive mestive all life without skiing out of the heart of skills on a heart of skills with the eyes of sleep?
So you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Si."
I have purpose of all those things.
I always had put.
And I also have purpose of things that people can't inate.
As the treat and other things often and other things often
But as it realize what I thought and I asked me and ask me to be the need?
It's ration?
It's logical that everybody debate to wait to be often to be slowed by a job that you feel to do it.
But what is so particular in the impreseses to make us nervous to realm in a way that other than other in a way that other than other in a way that other way that other than other people in a way that other than something?
How my father, for example, he was a engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of the activity that was asked to be able to engineer if they were going to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer?
Don't be -- that block of the engineer John, like well?
It didn't work.
Onestly, the engineers don't have certainly in the century, in sect of being alalcohype of being alcohype of being alcoputation of being adepressure.
We writers -- we have enough this reputation, and not only writers but creative creative of any generation, we have this reputation of being enormously instable.
And it's not going to look at the tristes of the death of the digger death of the magnific minds that only in the young people and often to hand and often to hand and often them to hand up.
And also those who don't have been in the sames that are really disagreed by their woms.
Norman Mailer, before I was in the last view of my book said, "Ogny book me a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the extraordinary of the work of the work of the work of the life.
But we don't have to be able when we heard about because we heard these things so we have these things that a long way we have been interiority and accept the notion of the notion and the sufference of the soft, at the end and the find, and it will always be going to get to the anking.
And the question I want to ask everybody is like to take this ide?
It goes on this -- because it also looks like a centimeter of being hon't be good for anything to be well for anything this suppose.
I think it's goods.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see the next century.
I think it's better incourage our big minds creative minds of living.
And I know that in my case -- in my case -- in my house -- it would be very dangerous, surrounded to be able to be able to the circumstances that are in my career.
It's true -- insome, I'm just a young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very likely to write anything that is going to write from the world as working that it out of the world as I have been going to be able to be going to be able to be going to be able to be able to be able to the last light of my light to be like like to write in the world as I was going to be going to write after the world as a job that in the world as I was going to be done after the world as a job that he wrote in the
I'm going to be slavery, because we are all or friends here -- it's probably like my greatest succeed.
Oh, Ges, you know, it's going to think about that.
You know this is the kind of the kind of thinking that bring a person to start to start to ball of the morning.
I would keep keep this work that we do.
So, the question become and become from?
And so I seed up after a lot of reflections, which the way to work to keep it to create a psychological structural cool, OK?
I have to find a distance of security to me, I'm writing to me, and my natural reaction of what I react the time to get E, and I was trying to get out of the year to look through the time, trying to look through the time, trying to look through the time, trying to look through the time, trying to find other societies to see if they could have ideas as as write ideas and health him.
about how to help people creative to gesting inerents of creative creativity.
And that research me to the ancient Grecia and Roma.
Seguith because it went to certain and then back.
In the ancient Grecie and Rome -- people don't seem to believe that creativity came from the "World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World
It was thought that the creative creativity was the spirit and that came to a few distant distant distant and sources and smart for reach, for reasons and smart of the distants and smart of the reach.
The greger of the spirits of the demonstration of the creativity of "demons."
Socrate, wonderful of course, it has a demone that elargiving sout.
The Romans were the same idea, but they called the kind of spirit without body a genius.
The big is that big did, because Romans didn't think that a genius was somebody else intelligent smart was somebody else.
They have to be a genius was this kind of devince that has been going to live in the walls of the study of a study like the elf, and that sell the elf, and that came out of the work of the artist, and to modeling the outcome of the result of that work.
It tough -- this is the distance of the psychological psychological struction that you protect you from the outcome from your work.
And everybody knew that was so that it worked, right?
So the antic antic antic near-like like like for example, like the too narcism, no?
If your work was exceptional was not able to take all the market, everything that was helped by this genius.
If your work work, it was not all of your workers: right?
All of the knew that was your genius to be a inability.
And so people have conceived the creativity in Occcident for a long time.
And then Rinascisment came and all changed this big idea; we put the human human being; we put the human beings and not let to the mistery and without more and let space, and not let space to the creature of the divinity.
This was the main human eximution and people started to think that the creativity to think that creativity from ished iary.
And for the first time in history, you get to reference this or that artist as a genius as a genius with a person with a person with genie.
And I have to tell you that was a big herror.
I think that allowed to somebody like to believe a charge of being like a recipiently as the sources and the source of all my own own responsibility and hitting them and heters and hitting and heters is a filterterterm or too much as human.
It's like to ask somebody of the engineer to be like to ask the sun.
Deform and historically. And he creates all these expectations on the performance.
And I think it was this pression to have destroyed the artists in the past 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think it becomes and now, and now?
Can we do it different?
And I would go back to a more ancient understanding of the human relationship between humans and mystered creative.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cancelling 500 years of rational thinking about a 18 minutes.
And probably there's people in the public that soil, you know, the public news on the notion of the notion of the notion of the notion of the fashion, you know, you can get them to the project of their projects.
I'm not going to convince you all about this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why is it -- why is you know?
Why don't you think about this way?
Because it has more sense of any other thing that ever ever heard to explain exasperant exasperant process.
A process of process that you ever ever have tent, so fundamentally -- so fundamentally all here -- you don't understand it is not comporting up --
And, in fact, it can be completely paranormal seems completely paranorm.
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary extraordinary of the poet, but it was a little bit for everything to life and he said that during the life and he said that during his childhood was working out in the field, and hear the walk, and hear the reach, when a poety coming out of the countravel of the countruthy was a poety poety and I would get to the country.
He said that was like a sky fragorous trend.
And that was going to get rotate to the lesson.
It goes to come to the ground the ground under the ground under the ground under the land and it good.
It was going to have a solar thing to do to that point and it was to say, "I run as a matta."
And so it goes to the house and it was inseased by this poetic and it would be taking a piece of paper and a piece of paper and a fababought in the pasty and return the past, and releasing the pay and relaunch.
Sometimes he couldn't be quickly fast, so it was going to get and recorrected and recognize and the roll the round and she would keep the roten and she would keep it to roll and he would kept up through the country, and he would keep the walk."
And then there were those times -- this piece of -- this piece of the time -- there were moments to be almost perdate, ok?
So, he was running at the house and he was looking for the charge and the poety and he was going to go through a mathematic, and then he said was like if you get to the other hand and and the off.
And he was going to get the poety from the coa and reput in his body and the page and the page of the page.
And in these food, the poety would be presented on the perfect and intact the last word to the first one to the first time to the first one to the first one of the first thing to the first one of the perfect and in these fit would be presented on the perfect and you intact to the perfect and you introduce the perfect of the word to the first thing to the pain the first of the word to the perfect on the perfect of these things,
So when I heard about -- it's pack-pack-to-up to my creative process.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a convicting.
I'm a mule, and my way to work is to working is sky at me at the same orary every day and to go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go on and go up and go on and go up and go up and get it on the same hororarian of the way and to work and go up and go up and go up and to work on the right horary and to go and go up and go to the draw up and go to the right right right right on and go and get it on and get to the drive on and to sout.
But even in my head, in my head, I was done again, I was done again,
And I imagine many of you who is a done of you know.
You know, if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas I wouldn't be able to sources I could not have to lot.
And what is what is this?
And how can we relate to the head, and how to do you don't want to lose the head?
And I realized me to be the best example I have a musician I have been Tom Waits, which I interview in a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, and you can actually excited the artist of the foreum to control, and dominate these species of instance.
But then instead of that, and a day day and a day day as he was driving on the authos Angeles, changed all for him.
He was going to go quickly and all of a sky track-half of half a hopen as the inspiration, and the wants and the wants and the want, you know, it's wonderful and you want to take it.
It has no paper of paper -- it doesn't have a mathematic, has no registrator.
So it began to feel this kind of ancient is growing in him, and I'll remarrinke, and I'll remarrinky hossessioned by this song.
I'm not enough broke, and I can't do a sky."
And instead of going to stop the panic stop.
I'm going to be the whole process and he did something completely new process and he did something completely new process.
And he just just said, "Scush and he said, "Scusa, you can't see what I'm driving do?"
"You seems to write a song?
If you really want to exist, you get back to a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
One of triment, you have to be able to one other today.
You go to the Leonard Cohen."
And his working on the workers after this.
Not the work was still knowledge as you seed.
But the process, and the fishing is that the brought was released when the genius was going to be able to be a sent and the free of the problems and realized it from the sky where it was going to be a whole thing that had to be a whole thing and it had to be a whole thing and I returned back and behind and it goes out.
but it well-hearing works, wonderful bizar, a conversation between Tom and this strange and extremendous thing that it was not Tom.
So what I was going to change a little bit about how to change a little bit about how I was working and save me a time.
This idea, was save, I wrote when I wrote to the Mangia, Ama, and he wrote in a sky of those in the suns of the disperation that it will be a disaster and began to think that that that what the worse is going to think that that what the worst is going to be worse books.
Not only but, just the worst book writing.
And I started thinking about this project.
But then I remember it on Tom who talked to the air and try to it.
So I went to my face on the hands and I would realize my hands to a stance.
And he said, "Yes, I mean, well, what is well, what this book is not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant cold.
Because as I see I am am going to put all of that.
So if you want to look at your baby and you give you you and you to get your part.
Okay. But if you don't know what it was, I don't know anything.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I'd like to flew that I today I today I showed me to my talk, because it -- at the end is -- at the end is -- at the end of the North of the Africa's dance, and skilled for the dances of the mouns and sacross and sland and and until the treatment to the be.
And they were always always magnific because the ballers were fantastic.
But every single one, something happened, and one of these artists became up in fact, and one of these artists become in fact,
And I know what I know about what you know.
It was like time you stop, and the ball, and the ball, and the ball, and it didn't have different from the sun, as a bunch of half from the sun, like 1,000 night -- but everything you can get it in the sun, but all of the time you walking on the sun,
And in suddenly not appears like a human human one.
But it turns out of the deep and under the did, and under the divinity.
And when this happen, I was a time and the people who knew what it was, they call it the name of his names.
They were sent and they started to cant, "Ah, Allah, Doh, Do, God, God, God, God, God, God, God.
That's God, you know.
He saw the nonstory -- when Morors invased the sound of Spay this habites with their and pronunced in the century of the well-"Oh, Allah, "Oole, "Oole, you can hear in the corrupt of the corrids or floor.
In Spay when a artist has something impossible and magic -- "Ah, oh, oh, oh, oh, well as well as well, and a short of God.
And it's great because we need to have it.
But the problem goes the day for the ball, when you see the ball, when you see and discovers that are 11 of Martedge and discovers of Marteds and the Dod is no long.
It's just a dead with a death with the eye, and maybe it never be able to be able to get that alteen.
And maybe no one dogs the Dod still as well, and so it has to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard to him.
This is one of the most of the most dolorous dolorous recycling in a life creative.
But maybe not to be so ancient to be so anguing if you can not believe believe that the most extraordinary expects of your being coming from you to yourself as you see.
But it created destics that you have data in prested by a squist of this squist of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you finished to someone else when you find.
And you know, if we think about this way all change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it is sure as I thought about different months in the worker of the book that public book that public book -- the dangerous dangerous of my big degree of my degree succeed.
And what I have to keep when I feel feel like to pay when I feel painting from this is, you don't have putting the well.
You don't have to be around.
He relies to presentt your own own own for your party, any of any sky can be.
If your work is ball, ball, ball.
If the divine, you assummer decided to leave some kind of wonderful time to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the sants, then "Ole!"
One of triment, you do the same tube.
And "Ole!" to you know.
I think and I think and I think it debt to teach it.
"Ole!" to you, even in the message and head. And headador and head.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've talked about some of these projects on the human genome on what it means and discovered to the new set of genes.
We're starting a new hold: we started digitalize biology and now to go to the biology and now in a new fashion, and then we are entering and synthesizing and synthesizing life.
We always seeing to bring a big questions.
"What is life, what is you have to be a lot of biological levels.
We tried to be different approaches, reducing the minimes of the minimes.
We're digzing from almost 20 years hour.
When we sequenced the human genome was going to go from the analogical world.
Now we asked them: We can regenerate the life, or create new life from this universe to this universe
This is the map of a small organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the smallest species between those that can authoreplicate in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create the genome to create a little bit more smaller.
We can be able to eliminating a hundred genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the not. And when it map in metabolic habolic to now.
He's deed, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimine, a time, it's very improbablem that this can bring to a vivent.
So we decided that the only via to progress to progress this cromosomes in a way to be able to modific components to the components to some of these questions.
And so we started the wind of the "Posan we skyetic cromom a cromother?"
And then the chemistry of producing these big molecules that we never have been able to create before you have never been able to create before?
And, in case business, we can make a cromom to make a cromosom ?
A cromosome is just a piece of material material of material material of the chemical materials.
The speed with which we can degree to degree the life is growing out of exponential exponential to exponential life is going to be exponential degree of the exponential with which we can degree to degree and exponential to degitalize the life is growing of the exponential digitalizing
Our ability to write the genetic code of genetic and instance, but it's better than him.
And our most recently results the door of the exponential treatment on a exponential curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has requires a lot of pass the first time with a biothic reviews before the first experiments.
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult to DNA is very difficult.
There are thousands of thousands of the world that are producing small segments of DNA, of the long equality of 30 to 50 lect and is a long degenerative process is longer than the segment.
So we had to develop a new metom to assembling these fragments and correct the herrors.
And this was our first tent, in the sentence of the digital information of Phi genome of Phi By 174.
It's a little viruses that kills kill batters.
We designed the frames, effect of the herrors and keep a molecule.
And the interesting part is when we took this piece of material material and we insert in the bacteria and we put it in the bacteria and to read this genetic code and produce to read this genetic particle and produce the virtual particle of viral virtual particle of virtual materials.
The virals are the virals are then you released by the cells, are background.
I talked about recent recent with members of oil industry who they certainly understanding this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build the same hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things more in big things.
We wanted to build the whole whole cromosome.
It's more than 580 mildle of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code.
So we thought of the viruses in the size of the virus, so that you can change the cassets to understand what the components to understand what the components of a living cell.
The projection is crucial information is crucial information in a computer, these have to be very accurated.
When sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accuratezens was of a herror, was a mibasic herror.
We found out of the gold, 30 herrors. If we had been used that sequence. And we had never been able to do it work.
A part of the process is to design segments that you smother than 50 lects of the 50 lects of 50 lects of 50 lects to build underlying the little bit smaller working together.
We can reject elements here.
You probably read you read the boys.
Think of what we have a genetic code on four liter: A, C, C, C, and T.
Three those lects together with about 20 minamminoacidifish, and there's a specific order to put every minammino-sky of the minum of the mino-sks.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, fraw out of the words,
What we did in the beginning is autographic to be audience.
Some were deluses from the fact that it wasn't poet.
We designed these segments for a thish of the same way to be able to unique with the entire set of these segments.
There are inspired in and they repeat them and put them together.
And we started to assembling the particularly beginning with segments from seven to set the milk of 24 miles to 24 mildle of 24 milddness to 72 mile ld.
And every pass we product these segments in pretty sought so that we can sequence, and then you can see in a minute. And you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatizing the process.
So, this looks like the tabellons a basket.
When we get to these segments very long as a long time of 100 mile basic minds, they don't grow the E.
You get the limited instruments of the modern biology.
So we have been considered other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called recombination called recombination of biology, which in biology to repeak DNA degree of the universe of the century of the minds.
Here's a few example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radioduring years, can sleeping three million rad rad rad three million rad rad radiation.
You can see in the danger as his dangerous as his hundred things.
In 12 -- 24 hours hours is reassembled as it was before.
They were thousands of organisms that are able to do this.
These organisms can set of them.
They can live under the subject.
I'm absolutely sure that life exists in space, and you spoke to find new environments of water.
In the real real NASA showed that this aven.
This is a molecle of molecules that we built using these process, just using the lieview with the segments from insegments from insegments from insection.
The lievist them assembly the auomatically.
This image was not taken with a microscope, but with a microscope of rule.
It's a very much big molecular molecules that we see the with a lawer.
These are pictures that bought a period of about six seconds.
This is the public that we did a little time ago.
It's more than 580,000 lacks code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code.
It's the largest molecular structure.
It has a fishshort of 300 million hons.
If we passit it with a 10 of type of a type to transck this genetic code of this genetic code this genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code with a code of the code of the code of the code of the code of the genetic code with a genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the gen
Now, how do we work this work? How can we activate we activate it do?
Of course, we track a virus.
It's a little bit more complicated when you use batters.
It's just just as much as a cell phones like our re: you can just extent the nuclean hole, and insert the nuclean and insert the process of clonation.
In the bacteria archaea is instead is integrated in the cells, but we recently have demonstrated that we are able to do a place of a birth of a cell phone of a cell phone and active to another and active and active to another and active it out.
We can do a bunch of a party bad of a microbial species.
The two are different as different as well.
We add some genes in more in a way to decide what you can choice,
And it has a sky with the inner of killing all the protection.
And when we put in the cells in the cells is just stuff, and you appreciate our softor -- the new cell of the new cell phones is going to go to the cellule.
And we thought we don't get that we can't go to the skill, but we tried to be more in the him.
This is one of the most exists of evolution.
We found that many of the ancient species have added a third hundred new sky of some of the hands of new tracks in a second hands of new tracks that species.
So who think about the evolution as a gene gene to modify as a gene of biology.
And there are in the inner called "inimes of restrion is that inderiting DNA.
The hormes that was in the cell phones that doesn't have a one.
The cellphones the cromosomes that we inserito-ha.
It's expressed and recognized the other hand, as a matter like material material material of the cell and we returned out with only the new cell and the new cromodes.
it became blue blue because of the genes that we insert.
And in a short left time, all the characteristic carteristic and it turned out of the new species, and it turned out on the new software that we insert in the cell.
All the protects, members are changed, and when we wood, and when we wood, and when we wood, and when we are transferity.
Now, this could seem alchemy alter, but altering the software DNA software to changing things in the hand.
Now, I explained that here is not talking about genesis -- but it turns out of three million years and half thousand years of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion.
Why do I do that?
I think it's enough obvious when we think about our needs to our needed necessity.
We're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
And I can give you a example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each other, in 1946; in 1946; it will be four years, they will be four or or not.
We were going to find problems right now to find food, water and burch, and broke, and banks and banks and a half half billion people.
It will be more during hard to do it for us.
We are more than five billion carbon of carbon of carbon of olid.
What means a lot of holds a day.
When we try to find biological processes or whatever like a huge process to replace it to be a huge challenge.
In the most of the half of CO2 emission of CO2 of these materials that finished in the atmosphere.
At today, thank you very much, thank you very scientific databases with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the design components to think that are components for the future.
The electronic industry is only one dozen about components, and think about how many things are coming out.
Our limited here are main biological reality and our imagination.
Now we have techniques, thanks to these meto-rapis of synthetic synthetic to create what we call genomic combinatoria.
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes that can produce a million cromosomes.
Think of processing these 20 million different parts or to try to get to prove the processes to make the processes or drugs, new vaccines, we can change a little team, and create more biology and create biology of science.
And it's just a selet standard.
We can chemical chemistry of survive, program of chemistry or carbon or carbon of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines.
This is a few software of some software programmed on that we're working to seeing species and designing species to seem to skills and designing species in the computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily as it will be there.
We know exactly how the genetic code of genetic code.
Now we're concentrate on the carbon of how much of quarter generation.
You see you saw you that you extent that you can see it from the floor.
We have a second burch of the third generation that will use enough pretty dall, as a burant bons like the othird or different kinds of butan.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing the food and limited the food and limited the diseases of the availability would be transforming the CO2 in materials that we were working for the cells that can reach this discovering discovering that we could get the first charge of how much 18 months.
The light solar combined with CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discoveries in the world, we fun fun in the world, we fun fun in the world, we have fun in the world, we fun in the world,
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean of the water of the water of the water perature of water.
It relies from CO2 using a molecular molecular as energy.
We're trying to understand if we can inchanaling CO2, which can be transported by your mind to the CO2 in the CO2 in the CO2 in the charburant to drive this process.
So that short we think we could be able to increase what the basic questions is Not to be able to replace is Not to be able to replace the whole industry of the whole industry industry.
All right. If you can't do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it it from TED,
It would wind a major of energy.
And then we're working for using the same metoh.
You saw this year with influence, we are always back, we always get back to a year and a dollar and a dollar, and it turns out to find the right right right now.
I think that what you can change in the vaccinable to change in ancient vaccinable.
Here's how the future could start to seeming change, now, the tree of evolution, accelerating the evolution with batters -- and indegrees and indegrees cells and indedegree cells and indedects.
We are so much from the best people.
Our discovers is to live enough to try to make a long way to try to do it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
And I will see you all see the most rapidly possible, some fundamental work that we bring to Microsoft in the Microsoft in the midle of a year ago in the square in Seadragon.
It's about a local environment in which you can interact with a local amount of data with a huge amount of data visual data from visual data in the local amount of data as a local amount of data in which you can interact with a local amount of data that is a huge enor
And we're seeing a lot of gabyte photos of photos with a kind of expensive and continue to a speed slips like we want to do the images like this.
And it doesn't matter how big quantity of information that we see how big we see how big these data or images.
Most photographs are communications -- but this for example, but this for example, from the Bilibrary of the Congress of the Congress of the 300 megam, and reent.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limited the prestations of a system like this is a number of place in your sky in any time. It's also an architecture.
This is a whole book of data is a whole thing of data doesn't images.
This is the Casa Dickens. The Dickens. The colon-hole.
And so that is about what is about texttremendous and we can do a whole thing of thing, to see it really is a represent representation of a represent representation of the texttremendous text of the textremely representation of a picture.
It could be a little bit of a little bit of a electronic book to read a electronic book that is a little book to read a little book to read a electronic book that you can read a little bit of electronic book to read a electronic book to read a little book of electronic boo
You don't look at it.
This is a more realistic example of Guardian.
Every picture is the beginning of a section.
And it will really give you the beautiful experience, and the beautiful read the version of a quotidian or a quotidian or a quote version of a very simply type of a midle of a half a lot of half a half of a half a very high-half of a quotidi
We also did something with the corner of this number of Gardian.
We created a advertising advertising of the resolution -- much more than what you use in a normal public of the content -- and we had insert of the content of the content of the content of the extra.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific specific technical technical and winds.
And this really demonstrate some of these ideas to eliminating the limites of space on the screen.
We hope that this means of the pop-up and other porks, and other similars, not to be necessary.
Of course, the map of the most obvious applications for this kind of technologies.
And I don't want to lose time, if you don't have to say that we have contributes to give it in this camp.
These are all the streets in the U.S. She requires in NASA.
So now we go to something else.
This is actually actually in the webs; you can go to the websk;
This is a project called Photosynth, which combined two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other research is a very interesting south in Noah Snavely, a student of the University of Washington, with the Selish of Microsoft Relisi Rick Selish Resear.
And it's from the web, gestures, gestures.
You can see when we see this kind of screen that kind of screen to the other and have this kind of experience, and have this kind of experience.
But the patterns of the images here has actually a meaning.
The algorithms of the computer have registration of the computer have registrated images together in the regists to the realm of the imagine, all the neighborhood, and Montags on the Montags of the Roccipes of the slide-show of the patterns of the winds. And these things are all of these things have all the space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a few more space spaces.
I want to go directly to one of the data set of Noah-- and this is from a precedent protype of Photosynth of Photosynthes: you know, to show you what I think is really the askey in this technology -- Photosthosynth. And it's not necessarily to look at the environments that we have the environments that we have the web.
We had to worry about the legal and saying that you to do it.
This is a rebuilding in Notrebuilding in Notre Dame pictures from Flickr. Basta digiting Noth and you get images of the guys in Flickr and you get images of the guys and saw on the patterns and saw that it's discovering that is discovering that is discovered to this model.
So I'm all pictures if Flickr and have been all colleged in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never have thought of the way to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratifiction to receiving this kind of accourage here.
I think you can see that it is a lot of different kinds of different kinds of photos of those photos in those photos in the SLR, a number of meaning together in this environment.
And if you realize that the stranger of the stranger.
Many are block of the fact, etc.
On some part here is a series of photographs -- except -- except of photographs -- except of photographs -- et.
This is a Notregistrated Notregistrates
We can go from the placer to the view of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the environment. This is taking data from all of the whole memory of how to appear to appear on the land, from the point of view -- and college all those data together.
All those pictures become together, most of the sky of the sks.
You have a land the land that we're going to be going to be there.
Think about this as a long time of Stephen Lawler on the Earth on the virtual Earth
It's something that grows in complexity in complexity of people who usually usual and whose vantages to us.
Their pictures are marched with meters of other people.
If somebody is the idea of contransporting all these kinds of the name of the name of Notans of Nota Dame Dymer Dame Desesesishes of all those data, and the place of all those data, and have a little bit of the inner in the midddle of the patterns of the kind of patterns and an experience.
Of course, a consequence of all all of the extremely elaborated every part of the Earth, and you don't only only only as the view of the plane and satellow spaces and similar images of the collective collective.
Thank you very much.
CA: I understand well? What is you know what your software to do is that one of the software in the next years, all the photographs of the next world. As all the world will be practice.
BA: Yeah. What is doing in practice.
It's creating in hyperlink, if you want to be like to imagine.
And it's doing it in the base of the images.
And it becomes very interesting if you think about the recheity of information that many of these images that many of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images.
As when you make a research of the web, you digt and the head, and the head, has a lot of information about the picture.
Now, what happens if that picture is a picture of your photy?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of seeds and the amount of reckets is really huge effect of the retless.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible. It's incredible.
BA: You want to thank you very much.
One of the principal when you travel and one of the research of the research is the power to live between who has no forget to the anti-data in the wind, the pasts of the wind, you touch in the place of the place of the place and we are the plants of the plants.
Bastic thinking about the sciamans Jaguar is still the Laa, or that the Laa, or that the myths are still himes me in Himalaya, and the bity, and the baby of the mya, and to remember the important central of the important central ancestors of the anthropologia, and that the idea that we don't exists in sense of course, but it's just a model of reality, but it's just a model of model of us, but it's just a model, is just a a a model of a model of a model of a model.
the consequence of a particular choices of choices that our stirps of these things -- well or a lot of generations ago.
And, of course, all of the essential tracts of essential tracts.
We all all all procrey. We all product.
We are subjects.
We need to deal the inexorsible instability of morting, so it doesn't surprising and balloos --
We have a art.
What you have found is the right right right to the sculpture, the ritm of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Exipe of the Borneo, or the Haiti, or the Haiti, or the Kais: Kais: Curerries in Kenya settery of the Sharan walks in the Shara.
He was the way of the journey in the desert of a month again the midle of the gyak in the walls of the world. And the demother of the world.
All these populations teaching us that there are other ways of exists of thinking other ways of thinking other ways of thinking other move in the world.
And if you get a atattime, it's a concept that can give you hope.
And in the same thing about cultures of the world creating a raise of life as a spiritual life that was going to be the planet and is important for the planet and it's important for the planet as the ragnatela as biosphere.
And you can think about this ragnatela as a hours like a hours and you can defined the ethish of all the concept of all the concept of all the concept of all the concept of the imagination of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of consciousness of the concept of the concept of all the concept of all the concept of all the concepts of the concept,
The fantastic is the fantastic of human manity.
It's the symble of what we are and what we can be in how inquisise.
And because the biosphered was free floor is happened to the himself and purposes to the him.
No biology, for example, it would say that 50-percent of all species is about the extinction of the extinction of the hypot of the biggest hypot -- in the most additive diversity -- and you don't needed to have a little bit more than the cultural diversity -- that of the cultural diversity -- that of the cultumistick -- that of the cultural diversity -- that the size of the size of the side --
The indict of all is of course, the person is the language.
When you're born in the planet.
A language is not just composed to a vocabolary or from a series of rules.
A language is the language.
It's the meeting that the animation of every culture goes in the world.
Each language is a forest of the mind, a wine, a bype of the possibility of the possibility of the spiritual ecosystem of the spiritual ecosystem of the mind.
And those 6,000 language, as as we sat at at Monterey, alleast allows to be susered in the orecks.
They don't have any more teacher than you teach, which means you don't know what they are died.
What is more tristes than the slightly to be the slightly to talk to a language, of the way to talk to a language of transmit the efs of the ancient of the ancient of the kid?
This is a sentence of somebody in some of the world every two weeks every two weeks of a walking and brings a wind wind and bring it in the tombs of a anguy.
And I know somebody of you will tell "It's not better than this?
The world would not be a better place, if we talk about the same language?" All ll right. So we talk all yoruba. We were all all all yorbe. We were all sleeping the same sky sleep?
We talk about kogi.
She realize a track track of what it wants to talk about your language.
And I would like to do a journey through the etnference of --
a little journey in the etnice of what we're lose.
Most of us forget that when I say "different modes of exists of exists of exist.
We take for example, this birth Barasana, in Amazonia in Amazonia that created at the midle of the ananony of the milk of the milar of the milk of the sideland of the milar fall.
It's about a popull that it's not able to distinguisn't to distinguist the blue color, because the chelests is identified in the forest, from which depends on the popular population.
They have a strange strange and a language rule, "examia light language, "examia is a different language that the language language of a different language.
All of all has been in the mythological put, all of the particularity is that in these family families that are or sets or sets in the mistick of the mystics in the mistick of a language.
They listening to listening and then start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived in the Waoranans of the Waorans of the first Her sent, a incredible popull in 1958.
In 1957 five mission of 1957 mission of a comping contact a fact that we had a fact that
They did the photographs that returned them in the halt of the photographs that writing this popular population of the forest of the place of the forest had never seen anything of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the forest of the forest of the forest that they returned out of the forest of the forest of the forest of the forest forest that they would never seen anything in the size of the forest to the place of the forest of the for
They told the photograph of the Earth, they have a research or a shape or a figura and they kill it was the diavoid and they killed the diavoid and they killed kills with the five mixic mission with the side of the walks.
But Waorans don't kill the strangers.
They kill the hands between them.
The 55 percent of the death was because of their mortality was causing from their own own stand.

And we have to find one of life in a place of life in a place of life in a plalisty and mult of life in a place in a place of the plalisty and multural world's hood and and multurn multimultural worldnon-
which is what the wisdom of all the popules can contribbuting to our well.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book in this book that hope to be able and provery, and I'll try to get some college college to the college of college in the case of the collegmental college of the college of the things that I wrote to the college of the things that have already to be able and evidence to be able to read some of the college college of the college of the college of the college college,
I want to start with what I call "the dogm dog,
The official official thing?
The official dog, the official society is the Western Western official well-being the well-being being of our citizing well-being of the way to be to hot freedom to be hoxim."
The reason that state, in the fact that the freedom is in the freedom is precious for human beings to human beings.
Another in fact that if we are free, today, nobody can act to do everything that massimizes our good, without no one who decided in our well-being, without no one of our good,
The way to massimizing liberty is to him.
And the choices people hannot, more than they are freedom is their freedom, most of the freedom is their head.
This is so found, it's so foundly radicated in society that nobody would be done in the two-hand-doub.
And it's also deeply in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress.
This is my surmarket. It's not particularly big time.
I allowed a simple named on the instance.
In my surmarketet are 175 conditions, without contributes of olethy behind and the 12 balsh balsh of the balsh number of enormous minds of condition, which no one of the 15 sky of the inner of the instead of your own own own degree.
Here's the surmarket.
Then you go to the sky of electronic to buy a stereereas a stereas CD, D, B, printer --
And in this single sky of electronic components is a big number of components.
We can make six million different combinations of different combinations that are in a sources that there are in a only negotid.
You have to love that there is a lot of choice.
Other sam: the world of communications.
One time, when I was a child, you could get all the service of the phone of the phone of the phonical services that were going to be mamma from mamma Bell.
He wood, he didn't buy the phone is not buy buy
A consequence of this, between the other, was that the phone doesn't rops out.
These are the temples are gone.
Now we have a variety of the phone almost illimitated phones, especially between cells.
Here's the cells of the future.
My favorite is in the middle of MP3, tanker and the form in the middle of the baby's banks.
If you don't have seen in the snegotial under house, you're going to be able to predict it up.
And what happens is that people in the negozes in the negozes and do this question, and do what the answ? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cellular that doesn't do too much like this.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water is the same explosion.
Assistance. It doesn't happens in the United States you go from the doctor, and the doctor and the dype of what you have to do.
You know, I walked from the doctor, and the doctors, "Okay, we could do A, or B" -- "A, we could do A, or B" has these well-well-wells and these risks. What do you want to do?"
You say, "Dr, what I'd like to do you do?"
And the doctor says, "As these wells and these wells and these well."
"What do you want to do?"
And you can releas, "Dr. If she was me, what would doing?"
And the doctor: But I am not lei."
The result of the result of the malato," expression that it seems to look like a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not that one to save the weight and responsibility to take decisions to somebody else knows what anything -- and almost certain -- and so we don't have -- and so we don't have -- and so in the ideal ideal to take the patient.
There's a huge marketing products of products, I would direct people like me and you, if you think you don't buy to be buy that we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy buy them, because there public them be?
The answer is that domatter is that we call the doctors to change the rector of change.
And so foundation as our identity is our hydriving is a choice, as you see in this view in this view of the kids. We don't want to force. We don't want to force. We don't want to force. We don't want to inve.
And we can reinvention us how many times you agree.
The means that every morning, in the answer to the risk of the kind of people wants to be there.
And I respect to the family and the mathematrimon, a time prospective, I heard about anywhere that was going to be able to the most pretty possible, and he started the most pretty possible.
The only true was choices was with choice, and not even what down.
Ogyday, everything is really to play.
I mean, a lot of smart students, and I do do about a time.
And because they don't even broke, because they're not less diligents.
but why I'm going to ask them, I asked asking me or no? I would like to do it no? I should do it no? I want to do it now?"
"I would have to be able to be able to think before I have to think before the charges?"
They're interrogative logories.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this imply doesn't completely compity, and keep a vote vote to my exame.
And they have to do that. They're asking questions.
Now, the work: we fortunated, as Carl arl Carl technology to work every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, from the Hotel Randolph.
To speak up there is a corn, and I'll not tell anybody where the Wii work.
You don't tell you why I want to use it to use.
What meaning, this incredible liberty liberty that we have to decide we have to decide, what we have to decide, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our kids to play hot with the cell phone in a task in a bax, and the nbook, and the none;
And even though they're all speak of all the minutes that we see our kid to be able to ask the game, "I have to answer this called the ataway?"
"I have to answer this email? I got to abbozing this liter?"
And even when the answer is "now, all this makes the experience of your child to be in other conditions.
So, from any part of that, all of the big things and large materials and large materials and life, life is a sky question.
Once the world was this: Ove, there were some choice, but it was a choice.
The world today is like like this, the dilemma is -- "It's a positive thing, or negative, or negative.
The answer is Shold.
The slides of them all over the negative of the negative negative sks.
All this choices two negative effects on the gent.
The first thing -- you know, it is that they are produced in liberation.
With tells you that choice, becomes very hard to do it.
I offer a meaning example of meaning a study conducttarian plans of volunteers.
A college had access to the data of the Vanky of the Vanethen, with about a million clients of a million clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found out is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the more, the percentage of adescribes of adescribes of the 2.
With 50 sources there is 10 percent in less of the offers, just when they are available to only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources that choice, is maleasy hard to decide to decide to the inkill in the questions.
And at the question and asking questions, and of course, and of course is not going to be there.
You know, it doesn't mean that these workers will be able to wind foot for cans because they don't have enough money, also to say that the decision is so osticics that decision is so ostics of the dator of the dator of the place of work.
Don't shot them, they're losing to 5000-dollar-year-old handle of work, that would be well to be a track to the articks.
So the paralysis is a consequence of choice.
And I think it's going to be like this.
"And finally, for the eternity: ketchup, sense of the exist?"
You would like to take the right decision is to take the right age, if it's for the eternity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong wrong and the wrong condition.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we have to evitself and do a choice, and we have less to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be with less with less options that woman is that if you were going to be able to choice.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of these guys who would be bought to the choice, and it doesn't have to imagine that you can imagine that you can have a different choices that would be better than would be better than it would be better than it would be better than the alternative imagined in the choice, and the reaches of the choice, and the received the sods.
even when it was a good decision.
And the choices that are easy to dispiact of whatever it is insodddly in choice.
And yet, there's what economists is what economists call opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has been well well as the value that we think about things that we are going to depend on what we confront with it.
You would say, when there are many options of options is easy to represent the careful careernative to the alternative and be less than the option that you have choice.
Here's a guy here with all of the people who are not New York.
But it's what you probably probably think.
There's this copy to Hamptons.
A place of sus.
It slightly so. It's all day. It's all about that. It's all for them.
Not anything. But what he thinks is Agostod."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are vie."
"I would talk about this in front of house."
And it turns out two weeks from the idea that is perdriving -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day of parking where you want to be.
The cost opportunities of diminum for what we have been excellent.
And more than the options that we have to look at the most of the characteristics will be going to be as a cost-opportunities.
Here's another example.
This views tells us a lot of things.
It talks about the time and maybe the live of live live life-
But the most important point is that any of you choice, you choice, you choices you choice.
The things that we don't choices have a lot of four that can make less attraent what we down.
Terzo point: spiral spiral growing expects.
I tried on my skin my skin a new jeans.
Porty jeans.
Once jeans were a type and wind them and wind, they were comfortable to have a lot of hold, only after taken a lot of life, they started well.
So, I went up a new jeans when the old ones were game, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cutter."
And the broke said, "Like is a slim phys," relaxed and fit?"
You want to be with the cernier with the botttony? "Stones." "Stone." "Stones?
"You want to road the room?"
"You can get them to the blind? Ble and the bladen be.
I was sleep, and after a little bit of a little bit of -- I want the kind of -- which was the only guy -- which was the only one idea that was a guy -- and then I tried to be able jeans, then I got a couple of jeans that I had ever been able jeans that I ever ever had ever been able jans that I ever ever ever had ever ever been able to say, "I want to be able janky jans that I had ever ever ever ever ever ever ever know.
It was the mas. He's all choice.
But I heard I heard about it.
Why? I wrote a book to understand that.
The reason I was worse for the worse is that with all the choices were altish jeans had to be perfect for perfect jeans had to be perfect perfect for perfect that I was altish for the choices had to be perfect perfect and the sks.
And I started aspectations of minimes. I didn't expected me when you go to existed a guy -- when you see 100 different kinds of thousand out of a guy had to be perfect.
What I had water was good -- but not perfect.
After I was talking about what I was choiced with what I was trying to confront in the waiting to expectative.
The add of options in life of the people don't forward the expectations that these are respectacs of options.
And this will be less soddddisplant, when the results are good ones.
No one in the world of marketing if it makes it content.
Because if you know that it was, you know, you don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is the truth is the truth of this.
"You was better when he was worse when he was worse when he was worse when he was worse when it was worse when it was that when it was going to be able to meet was still possible to meet the surprised place was still possible to meet of the pretty surprised place to meant to meet when you was going to be able when you
Ogam, in the world where we live -- opulent, industrialized citizens with the perfect of perfect is that we can hope is that things like to at the height of the waiting to the height of the waiting for expects.
You never have ever surprised to be the aspectative, my aspectative, my aspectative, are ingigant.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here is -- "Yeah, you expectancy -- "Yeah, you want to be a little bit of happiness."
I mean, small moment at the autho-to--- which is really sposed and my wife is really stuff.
I would not have to do better hall, I didn't have to be accounted.
But it doesn't always always is a bad thing.
And finally, a couple of the bought of jeans when there is only what jeans is that when you don't know when you're not going to be able to ask yourself and ask you say, "Why is you know, why?"
"Who is responsible responsible to the answer is clear.
The world is responsible responsible to us?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a satissatisswim to you who is responsible to the responsible to the responsible responsible to the responsible responsible you to you.
You would have to do better.
With hundreds of variety of variety of the succeeed.
So when people are taking decisions, even though the result is valized in fact, and they get the colate sunlight and damage.
In the last years, the depression is explosse.
I think a meaninger factory -- not the unique, but important -- this is that they have to depression is just that people experiences people have experiences because the standard are too high.
And when they explain this situation thinking that the color.
So the final result is that in general is that we are worse as well.
Let me tell you about that.
This is the official dog, what we all take for good and it's completely false. It's not true. It's not true.
There is no doubly a little bit of choices that don't have to be better than that I haven't going to be a lot of choices is better than a little bit better than a little bit of a little bit better than a little bit better than a little bit of a little bit better than a little bit of a little bit of choice.
There's a critical value of the critical value --
But I'm sure that we have been surrounded by a piece that choices our life.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost finished -- from the policy, the nice is the follow.
What allows all this choices in society in society is the equipment is the material.
There are many places in the world, and you know what you know about this is not that have choice.
The problem is that they too much fall.
So the factory of what I'm talking about is a message of modern, receiving societies.
And what it does not depress and arrabbing is this -- Steve Levitt me talked about iers as many of how those expensive and comfortunate of month. It's a spread. It's a predicted.
I want to say that these choices, complicated and dispendent and dispendent inuseful.
It's the deletes of the deletes.
They have to stand stay hand.
If one of what in our society is in our society allows to be reversed in those where people have too much as people have too much as possibly possibly as much as much as we can not only have to be able to hold.
