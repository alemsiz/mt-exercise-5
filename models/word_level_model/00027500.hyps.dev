<unk> year, I showed these <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk>, <unk> 40 percent <unk>.
<unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn't show the <unk> of the ice.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is, in some sense, the heart <unk> of the global climate system.
It's <unk> and <unk> in the summer.
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> for the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
As you see, they <unk> up to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, that <unk> summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years or more, it's like the blood, which here <unk> from the body.
In 25 years, it's been so.
This is a problem because the <unk> are interested in the <unk> ground around the ocean, where there are enormous <unk> of <unk> that, <unk>, <unk>, are <unk> in <unk> by <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> of the global <unk> <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, <unk> this point of not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> from water.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> with a <unk> team last <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: She's good. The question is if you look at it.
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north.
This is a river in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> had never <unk> levels.
This is the <unk> river in <unk>.
If you want to know how the sea level of the <unk> <unk> on <unk>, here is where the sea.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
On the other part of the planet: <unk>, the biggest <unk> of ice on the planet.
<unk> month <unk> scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk>, and that the <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> at <unk> feet of the <unk> level, like <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the third biggest <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which a few years ago were <unk>.
40 percent of the world's population <unk> water from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this <unk> is the water source of this city.
<unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, the same happens to the <unk> water.
In California <unk> <unk> is 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in crisis.
<unk>, as you have read, they're <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the world leads to a <unk> increase <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk>.
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years of <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk>.
If you look in the context of the <unk> can see the <unk>.
In the last five years, we <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans.
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk>, from <unk>, to <unk>, and on both parts of the <unk> <unk>, where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans.
The <unk> of the global <unk>, with <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the two countries with China.
And it's a lot of other <unk> <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> direction.
These are the <unk> projects in the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
At any way, there is a political <unk> in our country.
The <unk> of <unk> and oil <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
<unk> picture me <unk> something --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> billion <unk> of <unk>.
Maybe you've seen it on <unk>.
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America.
It happened around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> â™« <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and <unk>.
It's <unk> here in America, and it makes our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> <unk>.
It's at good price, <unk> and the <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: From here, from here is a lot of <unk> <unk>.
The biggest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> -- Al, <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al <unk>: So the <unk> for the <unk> <unk> has <unk> two <unk>.
This is one of them, one part.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: At <unk> we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
For that our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a public <unk> for public and <unk> the truth.
In fact, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it's also good <unk>.
So we don't know about climate change.
We want to do.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot.
So we <unk> a <unk> in a structure of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>. <unk> are a little <unk>, but this is the sound of <unk> technology.
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global warming, but the <unk> technology that you see changes everything.
Let's take a look. This is the <unk> <unk> technology.
Al <unk>: <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic security.
<unk>: <unk>, America is in the crisis; the economy, national security, <unk>.
The <unk> that <unk> all: our <unk> from <unk> <unk>, like <unk> and <unk> oil.
But now, there's a new <unk>, <unk> solution.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy in 10 years.
A plan for <unk> America to work, <unk> more <unk>, and help <unk> global warming.
<unk>, a solution that we <unk> to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more.
<unk>: This is the last one.
<unk>: It's about <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> that <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, sun, a new network.
<unk> <unk> 2: <unk> <unk> for jobs.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
Al <unk>: A old <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go to themselves.
If you want to go far, you go together. "
We have to go far, quickly.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED I did an <unk> on <unk>.
And I'm going to talk about how the machine works.
So here we go. And for those who didn't have, the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk>.
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were present less than a <unk> of a second from the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second.
All of that is simply <unk>.
This is the <unk> machine.
We <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk>.
This is what I work on. It's called <unk> -- it's <unk> <unk> feet.
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in <unk>. You can see the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the machine for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the control room.
It's an image of the first <unk> particles that he had done everything around the <unk>, <unk> in <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles inside the <unk>.
In other words, when you take that picture the 10 <unk>, I <unk> that the camera, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if there was this to <unk> more or that, when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> page was this.
That means that we've had a <unk> impact beyond the scientific <unk>.
This was a week later, there was a problem with the machine, I had to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works in the <unk> of <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you of the <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. I'm too <unk>."
And they can do it because when they're very <unk> to become the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, at least <unk> degrees, at a temperature temperature temperature <unk> to the stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> <unk>, there was a <unk> of <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric electric <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and that have been <unk> about 30 <unk>.
They <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
They're now <unk> to their <unk> place.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be again.
We <unk> it, and we <unk> to get some data to <unk> or <unk>, and continue so our <unk> to find out what the universe is.
Now, of course, in a certain way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering of <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think the fact that it's so difficult, the fact that we go beyond the <unk>, I think it's the value of things like <unk>.
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk>, <unk>, who, <unk>, in the <unk> of the <unk> experiments of his <unk>, his <unk> was Michael <unk>, he said, "No, too <unk> for the progress of the human mind are <unk>, that the ideas of science are <unk>, that there are no <unk> in nature, that our <unk> are <unk>, and that there are no new <unk>."
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> <unk> to when, from children, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, actually to think and <unk> problems.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that most of the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects, together with my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I started to say, "And if, when we use a computer, instead of having the only <unk> of the <unk> as a digital <unk> that moves on a <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> an information <unk> with <unk>,
and <unk> to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer, building <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer <unk> like a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer <unk> like a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with your hand, "<unk>" <unk> "between them, feel their movement and have a screen and radio <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, like <unk>, you can just <unk>.
<unk> are the example of a new tools to <unk> the digital information.
And as they become more <unk>, <unk> of their own movement, others, and <unk>, and as they get <unk>, of their own movement, others, of how we <unk> them, can explore new and <unk> <unk>.
Let's start with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about video: if you put it in a direction, the <unk> <unk>, so if you put it in a direction, the other <unk> back.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk>.
If you <unk> them, you know what's about them.
If they're <unk>, <unk> and they can <unk> it a little bit.
If they're <unk>, <unk> and they can <unk> it a little bit.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
So, we realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> <unk> was that we could use common <unk> on data, for example, "<unk> a color like a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color in the central, where they <unk>.
and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color in the central <unk>, where they <unk>.
If we <unk> too much, we can <unk> a little bit.
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk>, like <unk>, <unk> and <unk> where people can try things, and <unk>, where people can try things, and <unk> the results immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a <unk> of words that is <unk> half <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, at each <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, <unk>, to each <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, and while I was talking about <unk> words.
Then, after about 30 seconds you <unk>, and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try.
Thank you.
So here is some <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, I did so that I <unk> them, and I <unk> a video.
They're very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things like this <unk> is that you don't have to give people many <unk>.
I just say, "<unk> of words," and they know what to do.
Here we go.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
It actually wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
We wanted to build a tool for the <unk> of <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
So, he's <unk> out the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now he <unk> a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work! Yes!
So, <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk> <unk>, and it can decide how it <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk> <unk>, and it can decide how it <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> away, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have time to show you is a <unk>, made of <unk>, to <unk> and <unk> music.
It's a tool, made recently, to <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> <unk> here from <unk> as <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of these has four different <unk>, and you can choose what to use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of your <unk>.
And it just <unk> by making a <unk> and a sequence. "
These are the effects that you can control live, like <unk> and <unk>.
It <unk> it to a particular sound, and then <unk> to <unk>.
And then there are the <unk> effects as time and <unk>, which are <unk> to the entire sequence.
<unk> how it works.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, "the <unk> in a series, the <unk> in a series, the other <unk>.
Now I'm going to take a low line.
<unk>: <unk>: I'm going to <unk> <unk> --
<unk>: <unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk>, so I can control the effect of alive.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the whole sequence of time on one hand or on the other.
<unk>: <unk>: And now we're going to <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the sequence of the flight.
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can tell you, I can get a longer or more <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the entire <unk> sequence on the left <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work.
And today, I've had time to show you one of the results of this path, and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept that I want to <unk> is that it's <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with the media, that will <unk> information in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I can't see the time I'm going to talk to all of you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more than that, of course.
It's also the love and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't expect it can change.
But, he said, something particular happened in my life and in my career, who led me to the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is that I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the result of that is that everywhere I'm <unk> now, people <unk> me as if I <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm all <unk> now. They're all <unk> and say to me, "Can't be able to do any better?
You're not going to be able to write for all of life without being able to create a book that could <unk> to someone? "
Would you like to someone? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could go worse, except that I remember over 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> the same <unk> by fear.
And people say to me, "Would you not like to be able to be successful?
<unk>'t you <unk> <unk>?
You've got fear to do this <unk> for all of life without nothing out of it, and to die on a <unk> of dreams <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> <unk>? "
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Yes."
Yes, I fear of all those things.
I've always had fear.
And I also fear of many other things that people couldn't <unk>.
As <unk> and other things <unk>.
But, as far as I did what I thought and <unk> <unk> is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel was born for doing.
But what is there is so much in the <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not?
Like my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk>, and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where asked if they were <unk> to be <unk>?
There was never -- that <unk> of the <unk> John, how do that?
<unk>'t like that, you know?
<unk>, the engineers like no group, in <unk>, in <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not just <unk>, but <unk> of all sorts, we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
And the other than looking at at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> who, only in the <unk> century, <unk> young people and often for them.
And the ones that haven't <unk> seem to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before he died in the last <unk> said, "My book," <unk> me a little bit more. "One extraordinary <unk> about the work of your life.
But we don't have to do it when we've heard these things so long, that somehow, we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity that creativity and the <unk> of creativity, and the <unk>, in some ways, and that art at the end.
And the question I want to tell you all here today is you agree with this idea?
It's good for that -- because it also <unk> by a <unk> distance to me. It's not good for this <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better to <unk> our great <unk> to live.
And of course, I know that, in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> into that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> that I'm in my career.
<unk> -- <unk> look, I'm pretty young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything will happen now in then, it will be <unk> by the world as the work that <unk> after the <unk> of my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all kind of <unk> friends here -- is <unk> that my biggest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>.
You know, this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start <unk> <unk> at nine to the nine in the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I want to continue to do this work that I love.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so it seems to me, after many <unk>, that the way to work to do is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk>, OK?
I've got to have to get a distance of <unk> between me, and my natural <unk> to which I'm <unk>, and my natural <unk> to which wrote to get. And, as I'm going to do it all last year, trying to find some other <unk> society to see if you want to have better ideas and see if you want to have better ideas, and see if you want to have better ideas,
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
It's because it <unk> in <unk>, and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe believe that creativity is <unk> by men, OK?
It turns out that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> reasons and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far.
<unk> were the same idea, but they <unk> that species of spirit without a <unk> body.
which is <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really believe that a <unk> was somebody particularly.
<unk> that work.
<unk> <unk>, here is the distance I talk about that <unk> -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work.
And they all thought that was so <unk>, right?
So, the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like the too <unk>, right?
If your job was <unk>, you didn't have to <unk> all the <unk>, everybody <unk> that was <unk> by this <unk> <unk>.
If your <unk> work, it wasn't all your <unk>, right?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
And then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk>, and we <unk> this great idea; we put the human center over the universe, and the center of the universe above all of all of the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and not leave space on the <unk>.
This was the principle of <unk> <unk>, and people tend to think that creativity is <unk> by <unk>.
And for the first time in history, you start <unk> to this one or that artist as a <unk> person with <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think it was a big <unk>.
I think somebody, a simple person to believe that being like a <unk> like the source, <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> it is a responsibility too big to <unk> human <unk>.
It's like asking someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and completely <unk> the <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think it's true, the question, is it becomes, and now?
Can we do that?
We want to go back to a more <unk> understanding of the relationship between human and <unk> <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a 18 minutes 18 minutes.
And there are probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects.
You probably won't tell you all about this.
But the question I'd like to <unk> is -- why not?
Why don't we <unk> this way?
Because it makes more sense of everything that I've ever heard to explain the <unk> of the <unk> process.
A process that, as anyone who has ever <unk> to do something -- so, basically, everybody knows, you know, you're not <unk> <unk>.
And, in fact, it can sometimes seem completely <unk>.
I did this meeting <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years now, but that was a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> out in the <unk>.
He told me she was like a <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk>.
He <unk> him to come, because he <unk> the earth under his feet.
And I decided to have one thing to do at that point and was, words, "<unk> like a <unk>."
And so he went back to the house and he was <unk> by this <unk>, and he didn't have to take a piece of paper, and a <unk> enough <unk>, while the <unk>, <unk> and <unk> on the page.
Sometimes, he couldn't be <unk> enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without being able to come to the house and the <unk> <unk> through the <unk>, and she would <unk> <unk> through the <unk>, looking, as he said, "another <unk>."
And then there were those times -- this was never going to -- there were moments when he was almost <unk>, right?
So, he was coming home, and he was looking for paper and the <unk> <unk> through, and he <unk> a <unk> right in the when he was <unk>, and then said, that it was like if you <unk> with the other hand, and the <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page, but in <unk>, from the last word to the first word at the first.
So when you <unk> <unk> -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not a <unk>.
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; it <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> to work and <unk> over <unk>.
But even me, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I think a lot of you that <unk> <unk>.
You know, even if the work and the ideas will <unk> me from a certain source I couldn't <unk> it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it in a way that we don't lose your head, but rather, that it <unk> us?
As a <unk>, the best example that I've got is the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I <unk> several years ago for a <unk>.
I was talking about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life has been the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk>, trying to control, <unk>, <unk> these species of totally <unk> <unk>.
But then <unk>, he was <unk>, and one day when he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk>, <unk> everything.
<unk> <unk>, and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk>, who comes into his head like <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and the wants, you know, it's wonderful, and the <unk>, but it doesn't know how to <unk>.
It doesn't have a piece of paper, it's not a <unk>.
So he starts to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> <unk> in him, "I'm going to lose, and I'm going to go from this <unk> song.
I'm not <unk> enough and I can't <unk> it. "
And instead of going to <unk>, they <unk>.
<unk> the whole <unk> process and did something completely new.
He just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>, you see I'm <unk>?"
"Would you like you like to write a song now?"
If you really want to <unk> it, you'll be more <unk> when I can take care of you.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> more today.
<unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his process <unk> <unk> after that.
Not the job, was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that out of him, <unk> who came from him, and he <unk> back where he was, who didn't have to be something <unk> and <unk>.
but <unk> this <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing, but it wasn't <unk>.
So, how I <unk> that story to change a little bit even the way I <unk> and already <unk> me once.
This idea, I <unk> when I was <unk> "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and I went into one of the <unk> of the <unk> where we all're working on something, and you can't think it's going to be a <unk>, which is going to be the <unk> book.
Not just <unk>, just the <unk> book.
And I started thinking about this project.
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> into the air and <unk>.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of the room.
And I said high <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, what, we know if this book is not going to be <unk>, isn't it?
Because as you see, I'm <unk> everything I have, I don't have any more of this.
So if you want it to be better, you have to <unk> and do your part.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what, I'm not going to do it.
I started writing the same because it's my job.
And I'd like to be <unk> that I've been <unk> to do my part. "Because at the end is like this, OK -- <unk>, in the <unk> Africa of North Africa, people <unk> for the clear <unk> to the <unk> of the moon, music, <unk> and <unk> that she would <unk> on for hours and hours until <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every while, <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know what I'm talking about, because I know you have seen it all, at some point, a <unk> like this.
It was as if the time <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk>, and it was nothing different from the <unk>, like <unk> <unk> before, but everything <unk>.
And all of a sudden we don't just like a human.
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> under the <unk> in the fire of the <unk>.
And when this <unk>, at the time, people <unk> what he was, he <unk> him.
<unk> your hands and start <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "God," God. "
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, I <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> from "<unk>, <unk>," to "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," which you can hear in the <unk> or in the <unk>.
In <unk>, when an artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's <unk> because we need it.
But, the problem comes the next day, for <unk> itself, when you <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> of God's no longer.
It's just a <unk> with great <unk> to <unk>, and perhaps never <unk> to the <unk>.
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still <unk>, and what does it have to do with the rest of his life?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But perhaps it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you can't believe, <unk>, that the most <unk> of your being come from you yourself.
But let me just <unk> you that have data in <unk> from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you're finished.
And, you know, if we think it all changes.
And so I started <unk>, and it's <unk> like I <unk> for several months during the <unk> of the book that I <unk> soon, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> of my success <unk>.
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel like this is, I don't fear.
Don't <unk>. It just <unk> your job.
<unk> to <unk> for your side, whatever it can be.
If your job is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, <unk> <unk> to you <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for one moment through your <unk>, then, "<unk>!"
<unk>, you do the same your <unk>.
And "<unk>!" <unk>! "
I think, and I think it will be <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>!" <unk> "<unk>."
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
You know, as you know, I've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome, what it can <unk> and the discovery of new genes.
We're going to <unk> a new path. We started <unk> biology and now from that digital code, we're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We've always been looking for <unk> big questions.
"What is life?" It's something that many <unk>, I think have <unk> to understand at various levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to <unk> terms.
We're <unk> for almost 20 years.
When we have <unk> the human genome <unk> to move from the <unk> world of biology into the digital world.
Now, we can <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> one even smaller.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of about 500 genes that are here.
But when we take a look at its <unk> map, it's <unk> simple than our.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at a time, it's very <unk> that can bring a <unk> cell.
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that we could <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of the "<unk> we can <unk> a <unk>?"
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we've never been able to create before?
And, in case, can we make a <unk>?
A <unk> is simply a piece of <unk> material.
The speed with which we can <unk> life is starting to <unk> <unk>.
Our ability to write the code, rather slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We <unk> over 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> experiments.
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA <unk>, of the <unk> <unk>, and it's a <unk> process. The <unk> is long, the more <unk> there are.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, starting from information digital information of the genome of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a small virus that <unk> bacteria.
We designed <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> material and we <unk> it into the bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> the <unk> particles.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
I've talked about the <unk> members of the <unk> industry that they've certainly <unk> this model.
They have <unk> more than you.
<unk> that this is a situation where the software can actually build the same <unk> in a <unk> system.
But we could do the bigger things.
We had to build the whole <unk> of <unk>.
They're more than <unk> <unk> of <unk> code.
So we thought of <unk> in the size of the virus, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell.
<unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> information with information <unk> in a computer, they have to be very <unk>.
When you <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk>, the standard <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We discovered, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If we were able to use that original sequence will never be able to do it work.
One part of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> that together.
<unk> elements here.
You've probably read you about <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: we have a <unk> code on four <unk> <unk>: A, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> together about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order for every <unk>.
So we can use the code to write words, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did at the beginning was <unk>.
Some have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started to <unk> some of the parts, <unk> with <unk> <unk> to seven <unk> <unk>, <unk> so that they could <unk> <unk>.
In every step, we have produced these <unk> in <unk> so that we're <unk> to create an extremely <unk> <unk> <unk> as you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
When you start these very <unk> <unk>, much more than 100 <unk> <unk>, you're not going to go directly into the <unk> <unk>.
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> biology.
So we have a lot of other <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA.
Here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk>.
In 12 -- 24 hours is <unk> exactly how it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can <unk> completely.
We had to live under <unk>.
I'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and you <unk> to find new <unk> of water <unk>.
Actually, NASA showed that this is happening.
This is an image of the <unk> that we've built by using these <unk>, just using the <unk> with the design of the <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's such a <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we've done a little time ago.
They're more than <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's the biggest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's got a <unk> <unk> for 300 million.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 without spaces, we'll be <unk> pages to <unk> this code.
Now, how do we make it work? How can we <unk>?
<unk>, of course, is a kids game.
It's a little bit <unk> when you're using bacteria.
It's easier when it's <unk> cells like our -- you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is basically the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> is instead <unk> into the cell, but we have <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> to another cell and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a species.
The two are just as men from <unk>.
We <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a more <unk> way that you can decide which you can decide which is about this <unk>.
And then he <unk> with <unk> so that they <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell.
And <unk> <unk> that we couldn't go beyond it, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who think about evolution as a only <unk> at the time it <unk> doesn't understand much of biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that was in the cell didn't <unk> one.
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> is.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> as a <unk> material, <unk> it, and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk>.
it's become blue because of the genes we have <unk>.
And in a short <unk> of time, all of the <unk> of a species have gone <unk>, and it <unk> of everything in a new species, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, the <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the <unk> code exactly what we have <unk>.
Now, this may seem <unk> <unk>, but <unk> the software, we can change things quite <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that we're not talking about <unk> -- but of progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution, and I said, maybe we're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> new species on this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk>.
We're going to go for six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example: I was born in <unk>.
Now there are three people on the planet for <unk> <unk> in <unk>; in 40 years, there will be four.
We're <unk> problems now with <unk> food, water and <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk> for six billion people.
We're even more <unk> to do it for nine billion.
<unk> more than 30 billion <unk>, over 30 billion <unk> <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of <unk> process, it will be a huge challenge.
<unk> we have to realize that all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere.
At the day, because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are <unk> <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry is just a <unk> about <unk>, and think about how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from <unk> reality and our imagination.
Now we have <unk>, because of these <unk> <unk> <unk>, that can create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We can build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think about <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, <unk>, we can change, with a little team, and create more <unk> biology in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard <unk>.
We can choose to <unk> <unk>, chemistry or <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species in the computer.
Well, we don't know how they're going to be.
We know exactly what their code is.
Now we're going to focus on the next generation.
You've seen that <unk> <unk> from <unk> was an <unk> experiment.
We have <unk> second and the third generation that we <unk> enough from <unk> <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that biology can have a great impact <unk> of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 in matter before, so we're working on to design cells that can achieve this purpose, and we think we can get the first <unk> generation in about 18 months.
<unk> light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> of <unk> around the world, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the deep ocean, at about <unk> feet deep at the temperature of water.
<unk> <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2, which can be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So short, we think that we might be able to <unk> what the basic question is what life is. "We, we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where can you?
<unk> a <unk> of energy.
<unk>, we're working for the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we're always back a year and with a dollar in less when it's about finding the <unk> right.
I think what you can change by building <unk> <unk>.
That's how the future could start looking <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the tree of evolution with bacteria, <unk>, <unk> cells.
We are so <unk> to <unk> people.
Our purpose is to make a lot of living enough living <unk> to try and <unk>. Thank you very much.
First of all, I'm going to show you, the <unk> possible, some fundamental work of the new technology that we brought to <unk> <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago. It's <unk>.
It's an <unk> environment in which you can <unk> is at the local level that <unk> with an enormous amount of <unk> data.
We're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a quick <unk>, <unk> the images as we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big these are <unk> of data or <unk>.
Most of them are <unk> photographs, but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> 300 <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, example of <unk> data.
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> is a <unk>.
To make sure that it's a <unk> and not of images, we can do something like this, to really see that it's a real <unk> of the text, not a picture.
It could be a little <unk> way to read a book.
I'm not going to tell you.
This is an <unk> example. It's a <unk> number. It's a <unk> number.
Every big picture is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the <unk> and the good experience of reading the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk> <unk>.
We also did something with the <unk> of this <unk> <unk>.
We've created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much higher than the one that you use in a normal <unk>, and we <unk> it.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or some <unk>, even <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
<unk> that this <unk> <unk> to the <unk> and other <unk> similar, not to be <unk>.
Of course, <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on that, I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have <unk> to give even this in this field.
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over a NASA picture.
So now let's start something else.
This is actually living on the Web; you can see it.
It's a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> computer research that's very interesting computer computer <unk>, a student of the <unk> of Washington, with the help of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive in the Web, <unk> by <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here has actually meaning.
The <unk> of computers have <unk> these pictures together, so that they <unk> to the <unk> places that <unk> all <unk> to the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk>. Here you can see some <unk> of a <unk> or <unk> <unk>, and these things are all <unk> <unk>.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some much more <unk>.
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data, and this <unk> from an <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we have done for the first summer, to show you what's really the key to behind this technology, the <unk>. And it's not <unk> as <unk> as we're looking at the <unk> that we have in the website.
We had to <unk> some <unk> <unk> and so on.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> pictures of <unk> in <unk>, other <unk> and so on. And so on. <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture that's discovery.
So, they're all <unk> images, and they're all <unk> at <unk> level like this.
And you can <unk> this <unk> way.
You know, I'd never <unk> to work for <unk>.
It's very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different <unk>: from those cell phones to those <unk> <unk>, a <unk> number, <unk> in this environment.
And if I can, I can try and find those <unk> <unk>.
Many of them are <unk> by <unk>, etc.
You know, somewhere here is a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from <unk> to the physics of this environment.
The <unk> point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is <unk> data from <unk> from the whole memory of how to <unk> the land, from the point of view, <unk> <unk> and <unk> all that data together.
All of those pictures become <unk>, greater than the <unk> of the parts.
You've got a model of the <unk> land.
Think about this as the <unk> of <unk>'s work on Earth <unk>.
It's something that <unk> in <unk> complexity as people <unk> it, and the <unk> for those who are <unk> <unk> with <unk>.
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If somebody gets the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> <unk> the name, my picture of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> all of that data, and I can use it as a <unk> point in that space, in that <unk>, by using the pictures of anyone, and having a social experience of <unk>.
Of course, a result of all of this is very <unk> models of every interesting part of the land, <unk> not only from <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I realized? What do your software <unk> to do is that at some point, in the next few years, all of the photographs <unk> on anyone in the whole world in the entire entire world will be <unk> together?
<unk>: Yes. What he's doing is basically <unk>.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between pictures.
And it's doing it on the content of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think of the <unk> information that a lot of these <unk> images.
As you do a <unk> of images on the Web, you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page has a lot of information about the pictures of pictures.
Now, what happens if that picture <unk> all of your pictures?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous. It's a <unk> of the network.
CA: <unk>, it's really amazing. <unk>.
<unk>: Thank you very much.
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that we can live between who didn't <unk> the <unk> <unk>, including the past in the wind, <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk>, <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> of plants.
You have to think that <unk> <unk> <unk> even beyond the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> of the <unk> are still <unk> of <unk>, or that in <unk>, the <unk> <unk> still the <unk> of the <unk>, to remember the central <unk> of the <unk>, and that the idea that the world in which the world we live in which we don't exist in a sense, but it's just a <unk> model.
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done, good or bad, a lot of <unk> does.
And, of course, all of the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk>.
We're <unk> <unk>.
We have to deal with the <unk> of death <unk>, so we don't <unk> if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song, the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter whether it's the <unk> of the <unk>, or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> in the <unk>.
He was my <unk> of a journey in <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, on the <unk>, the <unk>'s mother of the world.
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of to think, other ways of to think, other ways of moving around the world.
And if you take a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life and <unk> that <unk> the planet, and it's important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk>.
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all <unk>, dreams, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> in being by the human imagination of <unk>.
<unk> is the great <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as <unk> species.
And <unk>, the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> at the <unk> and <unk> much faster.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk>, because it's <unk>, or on the <unk> <unk> -- in the field of <unk> diversity -- and you don't even <unk> to the <unk> <unk> -- that diversity.
The <unk> of this is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A language is not only <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules.
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the middle of which the <unk> of every culture is <unk> in the material.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we're sitting here in <unk>, at least half is no longer <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They're no longer <unk> to kids, which means, unless you <unk> something, which is already death.
What's more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk>, of being the last to speak a language, of not having a way to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the kids?
This <unk> <unk> is the state of somebody in some part of the world every two weeks, every two weeks, every two weeks, a <unk> <unk>, and brings the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know some of you say, "<unk>'t that better?
The world wouldn't be a better place if we <unk> all the same language? "<unk>, then we all talk about it. <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> of an <unk> thing means we can't speak your own language.
I'd like to show you today --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
A lot of us <unk> that when I say, "different ways of <unk>." I mean really different ways of <unk>.
So, for example, this <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, which <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that it's not able to <unk> the blue color from the green, because the time <unk> is <unk> in the forest, where the <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule, <unk> <unk>.
And all that has <unk> in the past <unk>, the <unk> is that in these <unk> families they're talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It <unk> to listen and then <unk> to speak.
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived with, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, an amazing <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk>, five <unk> have <unk> contact a <unk> <unk>.
They did <unk> from the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest had never seen anything <unk>.
They <unk> the pictures of land, and they <unk> them to <unk> a form or a <unk> and, they didn't know anything, they <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk>.
But the <unk> didn't just <unk> the <unk>.
They <unk> to each other.
<unk> percent <unk> was <unk> by themselves.
We went to eight <unk>, and we found two <unk> of death, and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that he died <unk>, and then they <unk> it.
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> 40 <unk> and <unk> the species.
In the early '<unk>, I <unk> a very interesting task, when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> to me if I wanted to go to <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> of the <unk>.
To give a sense of <unk>, I should understand the <unk> culture, and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk>.
It's kind of a <unk> view of the world.
Very interesting.
If you try to <unk> the great <unk> of the world's great <unk>, what would you like me?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent is always left out, thinking that Africa didn't have <unk> <unk>. And instead, and the <unk> is not the other than the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes interesting about <unk> is the <unk> of life and death.
So <unk> do <unk> <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the alive so that for a moment the <unk> becomes the <unk>.
That's why the <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk> <unk> go to speak of God.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And from the moment that you're <unk>, is the spirit that <unk> you, how can you get <unk>?
So they <unk> to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a very strong <unk> of the power of mind, when it's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> all the <unk> that I lived with the <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of the <unk> civilization <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>, the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>.
In a blood continent that has never been <unk> by <unk>.
In <unk>, they're <unk> by a <unk>, but their <unk> is extraordinary.
The young <unk> are <unk> away from <unk> to <unk> families, and live <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> in a world made of <unk> <unk> for 18 years.
Two <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
For all this time, they get <unk> to the values of their society, values that <unk> their <unk>, and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk>.
At the end of this <unk> <unk>, they're <unk> out and for the first time in them, they see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, everything that they've learned in a theory of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk>, everything that they've learned in the <unk>. The <unk> does a step back and said.
"<unk>? <unk> like I said.
It's <unk>. Now it's at you <unk>. "
They're called <unk> <unk> and they say we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world's <unk>.
This <unk> level is extremely important.
When we think about the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment, and the old history of the <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> to the Earth.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk> by <unk>.
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>, but because of the time and the <unk>, created a <unk> of the Earth's <unk> not on the concept of <unk> <unk> <unk>. But on a <unk> <unk> <unk>, but the concept that the Earth can live only, because it's <unk> by the human <unk>.
What does that mean?
Let me say that a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> is going to be a <unk> different human being, and will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place a <unk> <unk> that a mountain.
whether it's a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> to be <unk>.
That made me a human being <unk> different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk>.
If you try to <unk> that these <unk> can create reality, different <unk>, we can start to understand some <unk> of their <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> this picture in <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the <unk> potential of <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On the one hand, this <unk> <unk> a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only has a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk>, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk>'s family of <unk> said <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you're going to see the <unk> <unk> for the <unk>, the <unk> that make a different <unk> of species, <unk> it.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. It doesn't make a <unk> of reality.
I was often <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with his discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the '<unk>.
My <unk>, you can't <unk> these <unk> as <unk>, because if you're done, you can't tell anybody to be <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> only <unk> if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk> is: the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk>, the same kind of necessary to <unk> the <unk>. The question <unk> <unk>: in a <unk> of plants, how these <unk> <unk> to <unk> two <unk> don't similar, but that if you <unk> in this way, they create a <unk> that's <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if you go to the <unk>, you know, "The plants talk about it."
What does that mean?
This <unk>, the <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that to our eyes <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes <unk> in the same species.
If you tell them how they <unk> their <unk> <unk> us, "<unk> <unk> of plants, you don't know everything?" I said, "No."
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> in a night night filled with a different <unk>.
So, you know, you're not going to <unk>, but it's much more interesting to <unk> <unk>.
Now, you know, the problem is that those of us who have heart <unk> <unk> them, but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of the history of respect to our real world, and beyond.
In fact, the <unk> century, not <unk> <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk>, but rather like the age that we have <unk>, and we have <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the mass of the <unk> diversity and <unk> <unk> of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a new chance of life.
And the problem is not technology.
The <unk> <unk> didn't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> as well as the <unk> didn't <unk> to be <unk> when they put out of <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And if you take a look at the world, they're not <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> existence of <unk> forces that go beyond their ability to <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has been <unk> free in the forest to a generation ago, and now <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>,
We started to <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in the case of <unk>, are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk>.
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> of the political <unk>.
As the <unk>, the physics of a <unk>, is <unk> at the <unk> level, but the <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>'s life <unk>, not only is not <unk>, but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's part of the developing <unk>.
And you can't understand the <unk> of <unk> until it comes from the beginning.
I <unk> the <unk> miles from <unk> in Western China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only got to <unk>. I realized what's behind.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> at <unk> <unk>.
which means that it's been <unk> to the Chinese times.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> who brought the <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk>.
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at the age of two <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn't have a living without him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk>.
One day, he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and, for this <unk>, was <unk> to the work for seven years.
The pain of <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
At the end, everything <unk> to a choice.
How do we live in the <unk> world, or we want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk>, before he died said that his greatest fear was that, in our going to go to this <unk> view of the world, not just <unk> the whole <unk> of the human imagination <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of thinking, but a day we <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, who gave us the agriculture, which has <unk> us to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years.
That <unk> story, I didn't tell me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we could <unk> in the <unk> to come.
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human, <unk> with different <unk> <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the chance of being what we're: a <unk> species, which has to make all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there are great moments of <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the north of the island of <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and this man, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The <unk> government wasn't always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and the '<unk> for <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man <unk> of <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, and all his <unk>.
You want to know that <unk> doesn't <unk> the cold, <unk>.
The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> fish.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> from the night or the <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> away, it <unk> the <unk> in the skin of <unk> and <unk> in your hand. When I did it <unk> it, he <unk> it into a <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk>, and when <unk> <unk>, he <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> created a <unk>, has <unk> another dog, and <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> of <unk> in <unk>.
Do you want to talk about <unk>? [<unk>] And this, in different ways, [<unk>] is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the total <unk> of an area of bigger <unk> in California and <unk> together.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. It <unk> all the <unk> resources.
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, finally, I think it's kind of <unk> at least at least <unk> of the planet, <unk> that they're not <unk> at all.
For somebody is home.
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time. And for all of us, the dreams of our children, become part of the <unk> of hope.
To end, we're <unk> <unk> that <unk> have never been to anything.
<unk> that <unk> --
[<unk>] they're not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and perhaps we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our website <unk> <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our job is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public in <unk> to bring our public to <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> away from <unk> how they saw and, <unk>, <unk> for the central, the <unk> world, and we have to find a <unk> of life in diversity, and we need to find a <unk> life in the <unk> world.
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a few things that I wrote in this book that I hope you've already heard and <unk> some <unk>, in the case I'm not going to <unk> them.
I want to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk>."
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> society. The <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens." The way to do it is to <unk> the freedom <unk>. "
The reason is, on one hand, in fact that freedom is in itself a value, is <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for humans.
On the other one is in the fact that if we're <unk>, each of us can act to do everything that we <unk> our <unk>, without anybody who <unk> in name.
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> choice.
More choices people have, the more they are <unk>, and more their freedom, the greater is their <unk>.
This, <unk>, <unk>, is so <unk> <unk> in the society that no one <unk> to <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not that big.
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that nobody of the <unk> already is to your <unk>.
Here's what <unk> is.
Then you go to the <unk> store to buy a <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> store, there's a big number of <unk> <unk>.
We can do six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one <unk>.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice.
<unk> fields: the world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a child, you could get all the <unk> services, <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
You <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
A <unk> of that, by the way, was that the phone had never <unk>.
These days have gone.
We now have a <unk> almost <unk> <unk>, especially between cell phones.
Here's cell phones from the future.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
If you don't have it yet seen it in the store under your home, you're <unk> <unk>.
And what happens to the end of this is that people <unk> in the <unk>, and you know, what is the answer? The answer is, "No."
You can't buy a cell phone that doesn't make stuff.
So, in other ways of life that are much more important than the <unk>, the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: it doesn't happen in the United States you're going to go from the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you what you have to do.
Instead, <unk> from the <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, you can do A, or <unk>," A, "or <unk>," A, "he's got these <unk> and these <unk>. What do you want to do?"
You asked them, "<unk>, what do you want to do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you said, "<unk> if she was me, what would you say?"
And he said, "But I'm not her."
The result, we call it "<unk> <unk>," <unk> that makes it look like a nice thing.
But in fact, it's not that a <unk> the weight and the responsibility to somebody who knows something, <unk> the <unk>, to <unk> the <unk>, to somebody who don't know -- and it's certainly not <unk> -- and it's certainly not <unk> to make the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk> products, <unk> to people like me and you, that if you think about it is no sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk>?
The answer is that they want you to call the <unk> to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> of so fundamental as it is our <unk> now is a question of choice, as you can see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> children. We don't want to <unk> the children. We don't want to <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
which means that any <unk>, at the <unk>, you have to decide what kind of person you want to be.
<unk> to the family and at the <unk>, a common time perspective, <unk> almost anyone, was that you <unk> the <unk> <unk> as possible.
The only real choice was with who, not when, and not even what to do later.
<unk>, everything is really to play.
<unk> to very smart students, and they <unk> 20 percent less <unk> than a time.
And not because they're less <unk>, not because they're less <unk>.
but why they're <unk>, you know, "<unk> <unk> or not?"
"<unk> <unk>. <unk> I've got to think about a career before?"
They're <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this <unk> doesn't get the <unk> that you can't get a nice <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, like <unk> <unk>, because the technology <unk> allows us to work every minute, every day, on the planet, <unk> that from <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there is a <unk>, and I'm not going to say nobody, where the <unk> works.
I can't tell you, because I want to use it.
What does, this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work? Is that we have to decide, <unk> at any time, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son to play <unk>, with the cell phone in a <unk>, the other, and the <unk>, <unk>, on the <unk>.
And even if they're all <unk>, every minute we see our son, <unk> the <unk>, we're also <unk>, "I have to answer this call?"
"Do I have to answer this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And even when the answer is, "not," all this makes the experience of your son very different from what it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of them, small things and big objects and <unk> of life, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibilities, but not everything was about choice.
The world today are <unk> to this: The <unk> is, "It's a <unk> thing, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> we all know, so I'm going to talk about <unk>.
<unk> that choice <unk> two effects <unk> on people.
The first, <unk>, is that it <unk> instead of <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> between which <unk>, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I'll give you an example of <unk>: a <unk> study of <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> had access to <unk> data, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> society, with about a million <unk> <unk> in different companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 <unk> that are <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> two percent.
With 50 <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent less <unk> than when they are <unk> available. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> between which you choose, it's very difficult to decide, and choice is <unk> to <unk>.
And in <unk>, and again, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course <unk> never comes.
<unk> that doesn't mean just that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food for <unk> because they don't have enough money, you want to say that the decision is so <unk> that it also <unk> <unk>.
They're not <unk>, they're <unk> up to <unk> per year from work, which would be <unk> to <unk>.
So <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices.
And I think that will <unk> the world.
"<unk>, <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
You want to do the right decision, if it's for <unk>, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong bottom, and <unk> the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even though we can <unk> the <unk> and make a choice, at the end, we're less <unk> by the result of how you have been <unk> with <unk>.
And that's for several reasons.
One of them is that with a lot of <unk> between which, if you take one, and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you could make a different choice. And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> of choice, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> by the decision,
even when it was an <unk> decision.
More choices there are, the easier it is to <unk> of any <unk> of choice.
<unk>, there is what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> like the value that we give to things that with.
You know, when there are a lot of <unk> possible, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that it is choice.
Here's an example. I <unk> with all that I'm not in New York.
But that's what's probably <unk>.
There's this <unk> to <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all about them.
<unk> nothing. But what he thinks it is, "Well, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are away."
"<unk> <unk> right in front of the home."
And she <unk> two weeks from the idea that's <unk> -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where it wants.
The <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when the choice was <unk>.
And the more the <unk> that we have from <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about living the moment, and perhaps of living slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you <unk>, you're not going to do other.
The things that don't <unk> have many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk>.
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk>.
It was almost always <unk>.
Once the <unk> were only one guy, <unk> them and <unk> by <unk>, they were <unk>, only after <unk> <unk> a life <unk> and <unk> a lot of times, I started going well.
So, I went to <unk> a couple of when the <unk> <unk> went, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
And the <unk> said to me, "Do you want to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
Do you want them to <unk> or <unk>?
"Do them want to <unk>?"
"<unk> wants to <unk> or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a while I was able to say, "I want the guy who was the only guy." He didn't know what it was, like, for an hour, I <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk>, and then <unk> from the store, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with the best of <unk> I ever had.
It was <unk>. With all that choice I had <unk> the best.
But it <unk> me worse.
Why? I wrote a whole book for <unk>.
And the reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't tell me anything about <unk> when I just had one guy, but when I had 100 different, <unk> at least one guy had to be perfect.
What I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After I <unk> that I <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in the life of people don't make the <unk> that these are <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> themselves.
And this <unk> <unk> <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk> <unk>.
Because if I <unk> it, I'm not talking about what I'm talking about.
<unk> truth to that.
"He was better when he was worse." The reason he was going to when he was worse, he was when he was worse was possible to <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world where we live -- <unk>, <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to the <unk>.
You've never got to <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>," Yes, you want. "
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- that I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I couldn't <unk>.
But it's not always <unk>.
<unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there's just that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you say, "Why?"
"Who is <unk>?" The answer is <unk>.
The world is <unk>. What can I do?
When there are hundreds of different kinds of <unk>, and I <unk> a <unk>, and I'll tell you who is the <unk>, it's clear that the <unk> are you.
I could do better.
With hundreds of <unk> available, there are no <unk> for <unk>.
So, when people make decisions, even if the result is <unk>, they <unk> <unk> and give them <unk> to them.
In the last few years, the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have <unk> experiences because <unk> are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think that <unk> is them.
So the final result is that in general we're better, <unk>, but we get worse.
Let me show you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we're going to take for, and it's completely <unk>. It's not true.
There is no <unk> that a little choice is better than <unk> at all, but from this is not <unk> that much better than a little bit.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm quite sure we have <unk> by a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our life.
Now, from the <unk> point of view -- I almost finished -- from the <unk>'s <unk>.
What allows all this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you know, <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice.
The problem is that they have too <unk>.
So the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> society.
And what <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> talked to you yesterday about how much those <unk> and <unk> for <unk> are <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, it's not just <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk>.
They do worse.
If a little bit of what in our society <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people have too much <unk>, it would not only be their life, but also our lives.
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of income does good at all -- not just the poor -- because of that choice in <unk>.
To end, "<unk>, you can become everything you want."
<unk>, people of culture, I said, "But what do that fish?"
"It's <unk> that you can't do anything in a glass <unk>."
"A <unk> imagination, a <unk> view of the world --"
and I <unk> it like this, at the beginning.
But then, <unk>, I realized that that fish knows the long <unk>.
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk>, in a way that "everything is possible." You can't <unk> the freedom.
If you look at the <unk> in a way that everything you can <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
Everybody needs a <unk>.
This is almost certainly too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and, <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you.
