<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk>, <unk> 40 percent <unk>.
<unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn't show the <unk> of the ice.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is, in a certain sense, the heart <unk> of climate change.
It's <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
You can see, they <unk> up to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, that <unk> summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years or more, it's like the blood, which here <unk> from the body.
In 25 years it was so.
This is a problem because the <unk> is <unk> the <unk> <unk> around the ocean, where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that, <unk>, <unk>, are <unk> in <unk> by <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> of the global <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, <unk> this point of not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> is already <unk> from water.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> with a <unk> team last <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: She's good. The question is if you <unk> it.
And that's a reason that this <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north.
This is a river in <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> had never <unk> <unk> levels.
This is the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> of <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk>, here is where the sea.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
On the other part of the planet: <unk>, the largest <unk> of ice on the planet.
<unk> month, <unk> scientists <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk>, and that the <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> at <unk> feet of the level of the <unk>, like <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the third largest <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which a few years ago were <unk>.
40 percent of the world's population <unk> <unk> <unk> by that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this <unk> is the water source of this city.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, the same happens to the <unk> water.
<unk> <unk> <unk> 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, as you have read, they're <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> to a <unk> increase.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk>.
Sometimes, <unk> times, in the last 30 years, <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk>.
If you look in the context of the <unk> can see the <unk>.
In the last five years, we've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans.
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk>, from <unk>, to <unk>, and both of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans.
The <unk> of global warming, together with <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> <unk>, together to China.
And it's a lot of other <unk> <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> of the direction.
These are the projects <unk> over the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
At any way, there is a <unk> politics in our country.
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
<unk> picture me --
<unk> <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
Maybe you've seen it on <unk>.
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> â™« <unk> is a <unk> and happy guy.
It's <unk> here in America, and it's our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Al <unk>: From here, from here is a lot of <unk> <unk>.
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> -- Al, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al <unk>: So the <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk>.
This is one of them, one part.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: At <unk> we see the changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
For that our <unk> is <unk> a lot of money in a public <unk> for public and <unk> the truth.
In fact, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it also <unk>.
So we don't know about climate change.
We want to do.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of them talking about it.
So we <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! <unk> are a little <unk>, but that's the sound of <unk> technology.
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global warming, but the <unk> technology that you see changes everything.
Let's look at this. This is the <unk> technology.
Al <unk>: <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic security.
<unk>: <unk> is in the crisis; America is in the crisis, the national <unk> crisis.
The <unk> that <unk> all: our <unk> from the <unk> <unk>, like <unk> and oil <unk>.
Now, but there's a new, <unk> solution for <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy in 10 years.
A plan to <unk> America at work, <unk> more <unk>, and help <unk> global warming.
<unk>, a solution that we're going to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more. <unk> more.
Al <unk>: This is the last one.
<unk>: It's about <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> to the <unk> that <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, sun, a new network.
<unk> <unk> 2: <unk> <unk> for jobs <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
Al <unk>: A old <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go to themselves.
If you want to go far, you go together. "
We have to go far, quickly.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED I did an <unk> on <unk>.
And I'm going to try to <unk> about how the machine works.
So, I <unk> it. And for those that time didn't have, the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk>.
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in the <unk> of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second.
All of that is simply <unk>.
This is the <unk> machine.
We <unk> these <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
This is what I'm working on. It's called <unk> -- <unk> <unk> feet and has a <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in construction in the construction, so you can see the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> last year, we <unk> the machine for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was <unk> <unk> in the control room.
It's an image of the first <unk> particles that he had done all the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles inside the <unk>.
In other words, when you take that picture the 10 <unk>, I <unk> that the machine, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if you was this to <unk> more or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this.
That means that we've had a <unk> <unk> <unk> beyond the scientific <unk>.
<unk> a week later, there was a problem with the machine, I had to do this <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works in the <unk> of <unk>.
Now, the <unk> of you <unk> the <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. It's too <unk>."
And they can do that because when they're very <unk> to become the <unk> <unk>.
So, <unk> degrees, at a <unk> temperature temperature <unk> to the <unk> of the space between the stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, there was a <unk> of <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric electric <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and that have been <unk> about 30 <unk>.
They <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
They're now <unk> to their <unk> place.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be again.
We <unk> it, and we try to get some data to <unk> or <unk>, and continue so our <unk> to find out what the universe is.
Now, of course, in a certain way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the value of science and engineering of <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think the fact that it's so difficult, the fact that it's the <unk> of things like <unk>.
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk>, <unk>, who, <unk>, in the <unk> of the <unk> experiments of his <unk>, his <unk> was Michael <unk>, said, "No, so <unk> for the progress of the human mind is <unk>, and that no <unk>, that there are <unk> in nature, that our <unk> are <unk>, and that don't have <unk>."
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> <unk> to when, from children, <unk> <unk>.
As I was <unk> as a <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, they actually think and solve <unk> problems.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> most of the world around us.
So, as a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with objects, together with my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk>, I started <unk>, I started <unk>, I started <unk>, and I started <unk>, "And if we use a computer, instead of having the only <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an information <unk> with <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> an information <unk> with both of the hands,
and <unk> to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that I thought about <unk> the answer, building <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> great computer.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> great computer.
You can <unk> them with your hand, "<unk>" <unk> "between them, feel their movement and have a <unk> <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, like <unk>, you can just <unk>.
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> digital information.
And as they get <unk>, <unk> of their own movement, others, and they get more <unk>, <unk> of their movement, others, of their own movement, others, how we <unk> them, <unk> new <unk> <unk>.
Let's start with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about video: if you put it in a direction, the video <unk>, so if you can put it in a direction, the other end.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk>.
If you <unk> them, you know, what's about them.
If they're <unk>, they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
If they're <unk>, they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We have then realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> <unk> was that we could use common <unk> on data, for example, "<unk> a color like a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> the color in the central one where you <unk>.
and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color in the central one where you <unk>.
If we <unk> too much, we can <unk> it.
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk>, like <unk>, <unk> and <unk> where people can <unk> things, and <unk> the results of where people can <unk> things, and <unk> the results immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a <unk> game. It's <unk> between <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, at any <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, <unk>, at each <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, and while I was talking about <unk> words, and as I was <unk> to <unk> words.
Then, after about 30 seconds, you get <unk>, and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> to try.
Thank you.
Here's over the <unk> <unk> <unk>, I did <unk> <unk> <unk>, I did <unk> them, and I <unk> a video.
They're very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things like this <unk> is that you don't have to give people many <unk>.
I just say, "<unk> of words," and they know what to do.
Here's the other people who <unk> it.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, there right.
It actually wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
We wanted to build a tool for the <unk> of <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
So, he's <unk> out the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now he <unk> a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work! Yes!
So, <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can make the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk> <unk>, and it can decide how to <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk> <unk>, and it can decide how to <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> away, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have time to show you is a <unk>, made of a recent <unk>, to <unk> and <unk> music.
It's a tool, which is recently made of <unk>, for <unk> and music.
<unk> <unk> here from <unk> as a <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of these has four different <unk>, and you can choose which we use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of your <unk>.
And they just <unk> by making a <unk> and a sequence.
These are the effects that you can control live, like <unk> and <unk>.
I <unk> it to a particular sound, and then <unk> to <unk>.
And then there are the <unk> effects of as time and <unk>, that are <unk> to the entire sequence.
<unk> how it works.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>," the <unk> in a series, the <unk>, <unk>.
Now, I'm going to take a <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: Now I'm going to <unk> <unk> --
<unk>: <unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk>, so I can control the effect of alive.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the whole sequence of time on one hand or on the other.
<unk>: <unk>: And now we're going to <unk> the <unk> to <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the sequence of the flight.
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the whole sequence <unk> <unk> the <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work.
And today, I've had time to show you one of the results of this path, and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept that I want to <unk> is that it's going to <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with the media, that we want.
Thank you very much.
I can't see the time I'm going to talk to all of you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more of this, of course.
It's also love and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't expect that to change.
But, I said this, something particular is happened in my life and my career, who brought me to the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is that I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that everywhere I'm going to <unk> now, people <unk> me as if I <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm all <unk> now. They say, "You don't fear of being able to do more?
You don't fear to write all the life without being able to do all of life without being able to do? "
What can you <unk> to someone? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could go worse, except that I remember over 20 years ago, when I started to tell people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I <unk> to <unk> the same <unk> by fear.
And people say to me, "<unk>'t you know, you don't know you can't be able to be able to be <unk>?
You don't <unk> <unk>?
You've got fear to do this <unk> for all life without anything to have anything out and you'll die on a <unk> of dreams with the <unk> <unk> of <unk>? "
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid of all those things.
I've always had fear.
And I also fear of many other things that people couldn't <unk>.
As <unk> and other things <unk>.
But, as I'm going to write about the thing I thought and <unk> <unk> is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel was born for doing.
But what is there's so <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not?
How my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where asked if they were <unk> to be <unk>?
There was never -- that <unk> of the <unk> John, how do you go?
<unk>'t you like this, <unk>?
<unk>, engineers like a group <unk> have no <unk>, in <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not just <unk>, but <unk> of all sorts, we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
And they don't know what we're looking at at the <unk> <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, <unk> young people and often for them.
And the ones that don't seem like to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before he died in the last <unk> said, "My book," <unk> me a little bit more. "And this is a little <unk> about the work of their lives.
But we don't have to <unk> when we say that because we've heard these things so long that somehow we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity that creativity and the <unk> are in some ways, and that art at the end, <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> all over here is you agree with this idea?
It's good for this -- because also, <unk> by a <unk> distance to me, it's not good for this <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better to <unk> our great <unk> to live.
And of course, I know that, in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> into that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I'm in my career.
<unk> -- <unk> look, I'm pretty young, I've got 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything will happen now in then, it's <unk> by the world like the work that will <unk> after the <unk> of my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all <unk> or less friends here -- is <unk> that my biggest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, what that thinking.
You know, this is the kind of thought that brings a person to start <unk> <unk> to the nine to the middle nine morning and I don't want to do it.
I want to continue to do this work that I love.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so, it seems to me, after many <unk>, that the way to work to continue to write is what you create a <unk> <unk> <unk>, OK?
I have to have to do a distance of security between me, and my <unk> <unk> on what the <unk> wrote to get, and my <unk> on which wrote, and I'm going to do, and I'm going to do it all last year, looking for other societies, looking to find out if you could have better ideas and see if you could find some of the best ideas and <unk>.
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
It's because it <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that creativity <unk> from men, OK?
It turns out that creativity was this <unk> <unk> spirit, and that <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> reasons and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> we have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
<unk> were the same idea, but they <unk> that species of spirit without a <unk> body.
And that's <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really believe that a <unk> was a particularly somebody particularly.
I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, a little bit like the <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> out to <unk> the artist's work and <unk> the <unk> of that work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> you from the <unk> of which I'm talking about that <unk> you from the results of your work.
And everybody thought was so that I was <unk>, right?
So, the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like the too <unk>, right?
If your work was <unk>, you didn't <unk> to <unk> all the <unk>, everybody <unk> that was <unk> by this <unk> <unk>.
If your <unk> work, it wasn't all your <unk>, right?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
Then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk>, and we <unk> this great idea; we put the human center over the universe, and the center of the universe above all of the <unk> and <unk> and without <unk> space to <unk> creatures that <unk> from <unk>.
This was the <unk> principle and people started to think that creativity is <unk> by <unk>.
And for the first time in history, you start <unk> to this one or that artist as a <unk> person with <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think it was a big <unk>.
I think you can somebody, a simple person to believe that being like a <unk> like the source, <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility for a <unk> too big to give to human <unk>.
It's like to ask someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years.
And, if that is true, and I think that's true, the question is, and I think that's the question?
Can we do that?
We want to go back to a <unk> understanding of human relationship between human and <unk> <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking in an 18 minutes 18 minutes.
And there are probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk>, <unk>, you know, you're going to <unk> people <unk> on their projects.
You probably don't <unk> all about this.
But the question I want to ask you is -- why not?
Why don't we <unk> this way?
Because it makes more sense of anything that I've ever heard to explain the <unk> of the <unk> process.
A process, as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so, basically, all here -- knows, you know, you don't <unk> <unk>.
And, in fact, it can <unk> <unk>.
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years now, but that was a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> out in the <unk>.
He said, he was like a <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> to her from <unk>.
He <unk> him to come, because he <unk> the earth under his feet.
And I thought I had one thing to do to that point and was, words, "<unk> like a <unk>."
And so he went back to the house and he was <unk> by this <unk>, and he didn't have to do anything else that I had a paper and a <unk> enough <unk>, and <unk> on the page.
Sometimes, he couldn't be <unk> enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without being able to come home and <unk> and she would <unk> her <unk> and her <unk> and she would <unk> her <unk> and she said, "" another <unk>. "
And then there were those times -- this was never going to -- there were moments when he was almost <unk>, OK?
So, he was coming home and was looking for paper and <unk> her <unk> through, and he <unk> a <unk> right in the while he was <unk>, and then said, that it was like if you <unk> with the other hand and <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page, but in the <unk>, from the last word to the first word to the first word to the first.
So when I <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not a <unk>.
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; I'm going to <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> to work and <unk> over <unk>.
But even me, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I think many of you that <unk> the fact.
You know, even if the work and ideas I <unk> to <unk> from a certain source I couldn't <unk> it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it so that we don't have to <unk> your head, but rather, that <unk> <unk> us?
As I'm about, the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I <unk> different years ago for a <unk>.
I was talking about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life is the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk>, trying to control, <unk>, <unk> these <unk> <unk>, <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then <unk>, he was <unk>, and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk>, <unk> everything.
<unk> <unk>, and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk>, who comes into his head as <unk> does the <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and the wants, you know, it's wonderful, and the <unk>, but it doesn't know how to <unk>.
It's not a piece of paper, it's not a <unk>.
So he starts to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> <unk> in him, "I'm going to lose, and I'm going to <unk>, and I'm going to <unk> this <unk> song.
I'm not <unk> enough, and I can't <unk> it. "
And instead of going to <unk>, they <unk>.
He <unk> the whole <unk> process and made something completely new.
He just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>, you see I'm <unk>?"
"Do you think you can write a song now?"
If you really want to <unk>, you'll <unk> it in a more <unk> time I can take care of you.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> else.
<unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his process <unk> <unk> after that.
Not the work, the work was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that out of him <unk> <unk> that out of him, <unk> that <unk> out of the problems and <unk> it back where it was, and he was <unk>.
but he <unk> this <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that we had to <unk>.
So, how I <unk> that story to change a little bit even the way I'm going to and already <unk> me once.
This idea, I was <unk> when I was <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and I went to one of those <unk> <unk> when everybody's working on something, and you can't do it and you start thinking it's going to be a <unk>, which is going to be the <unk>, which is going to be the <unk>.
Not just <unk>, just <unk> the book wrote.
And I started thinking about this project.
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> into the air and <unk>.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of the room.
And I said high <unk>, "<unk>, what, we know, we know that if this book is not going to be <unk>, you know, you know, you won't.
Because as you see, I'm <unk> everything I have, I don't have any more of this.
So if you want it to be better, you have to <unk> and do your part.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what, I'm not going to do it.
I started writing the same because it's my job.
And I want to do, please, that I <unk> to do my part of the "because -- at the end is like this, OK -- <unk>, in the <unk> Africa of North people <unk> for the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every once once a while, <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know what I'm talking about, because I know you have seen it, you all know, at some point, a <unk> like this.
It was as if the time <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and he was nothing different from the <unk>, like <unk> <unk> before, but everything <unk>.
And suddenly we don't just <unk> as a human.
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
And when this <unk>, at the time, people <unk> what was, I <unk> it with her name.
<unk> hands and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "God," God, "God," God, "God," God, "God," God, "God," God, "God," God, "God," God, "God," God, "God," God, "God," God, "God," God, "God," God, "God," God
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, I <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which you can hear in the <unk> or in the <unk>.
In <unk>, when an artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's <unk> because we need it.
But, the problem comes the next day, for the <unk> itself, when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of God's no longer.
It's just a <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and perhaps never <unk> to the <unk>, and maybe never <unk> to that <unk>.
And perhaps nobody <unk> the name of God still <unk>, and what does it have to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But perhaps it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you can't believe, <unk>, that the most <unk> of your being come from you yourself.
But you just <unk> that you have data in <unk> from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to then <unk> to <unk> when you're finished.
And, you know, if we think about this way everything changes.
And so I started <unk>, and that's <unk> like I <unk> for several months during the <unk> <unk>'s book that I was soon, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> of my success <unk>.
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is, I'm not afraid to be.
Don't <unk>. You just <unk> your job.
<unk> <unk> for your side, any of any of the way.
If your job is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, you'll <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for one moment through your <unk>, then, "<unk>!"
<unk>, you do the same your <unk>.
And "<unk>!" <unk>! "
I think it's <unk>. It's <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
You know, as you know, I've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome, what it can <unk> and the discovery of new genes.
We're now <unk> a new path. We started <unk> biology and now starting to <unk> biology and now from that digital code, we're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always tried to <unk> with big questions.
"What is life?" It's something that many <unk>, I think have <unk> to understand at various levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to <unk> terms.
We're <unk> for almost 20 years.
When we have <unk> the human genome <unk> that we <unk> from <unk> the <unk> world of biology to the digital computer.
Now we're going to <unk> us: can we <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> one more small.
We can <unk> a <unk> of about 500 <unk> of about 500 than 500 of the genes that are here.
But when we take a look at his map, it's <unk> simple than our.
<unk>, that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at a time, it's very <unk> that can bring a <unk> cell.
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that we could <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of the "<unk> we can <unk> a <unk>?"
Can the chemistry <unk> of produce these big molecules that we've never been able to create before?
And, in case, can we make a <unk>?
A <unk> is simply a piece of <unk> material.
The speed with which we can <unk> life is <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
Our ability to write the code, instead, <unk> slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
We've <unk> over 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before they <unk> the first experiments.
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of <unk> in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA <unk>, of the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, and it's a <unk> process. The <unk> is long, the <unk> is long.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, starting from information digital information of the genome of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a little virus that <unk> bacteria.
We designed <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA about <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material <unk> and we <unk> it in the bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> the <unk> particles.
<unk> particles have been <unk> by cells, are <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I've talked about the <unk> members of the <unk> industry that they certainly have <unk> this model.
They have <unk> more than you.
And I think this is a situation where the software can actually build the same <unk> in a <unk> system.
But we could do the bigger things in the world.
We had to build the whole <unk> of <unk>.
They're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> code.
So we thought about <unk> <unk> of the size of the virus, so that we can change <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell.
<unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> information with information <unk> in a computer, they have to be very <unk>.
When I first <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> <unk>, it was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We found, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If we were using that original sequence never <unk> that original sequence.
One part of the process is designing <unk> <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> that together.
<unk> elements here.
You've probably read that <unk> us about <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: we have a <unk> <unk> code on four <unk> <unk>: A, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order for every <unk>.
So we can use the code for writing words, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did at the beginning was <unk>.
Some of them had been <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started to <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them until 24 <unk> <unk>.
In every step, we have produced these <unk> <unk> so that we're <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> <unk>, as you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
When you get to these very <unk>, very <unk> than 100 <unk> <unk>, you don't get any longer directly in the <unk> <unk>.
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of biology.
So we have <unk> some other <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA that are <unk> to <unk> the <unk>.
Here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In 12 -- 24 hours, it's <unk> exactly how it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can <unk> completely.
We had to live under <unk>.
I'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and you <unk> to find new <unk> of water.
Actually, NASA showed that this is happening.
This is a picture of the <unk> that we've built using these <unk>, just by using the <unk> with the <unk> design of <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's such a <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we've done a little time ago.
They're more than <unk> <unk> of <unk> code.
It's the biggest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's got a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk>, you'll have to <unk> pages to <unk> this code.
Now, how do we make it work? How can we <unk>?
Of course, there is a kids game.
It's a little bit more <unk> when you're using bacteria.
It's <unk> when it comes to the <unk> cells like our -- you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is basically the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> is instead <unk> in the cell, but we have <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> to a other cell and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a species.
The two are the <unk> men from <unk>.
We <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a more <unk> way that you can decide which you can decide which is to choose to this <unk>.
And then he <unk> with <unk> so that they <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell, it was <unk>, and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell.
And we had to <unk> that we couldn't go beyond it, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who thinks about evolution as a only <unk> at the time you <unk> not to be a lot of biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that was in the cell, I didn't have one.
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> is.
It <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> as a <unk> material, <unk> it, and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk>.
It's become blue <unk> because of the genes we have <unk>.
And in a short short time, all of the <unk> of a species, you go <unk>, and it <unk> of all sorts of <unk> into a new species, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, the <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the code <unk> exactly what we've <unk>.
Now, this may seem <unk> <unk>, but we can <unk> the software, we can change things quite <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that we're not talking about <unk> -- but of progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> new species on this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk>.
We're going to go for six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example: I was born in <unk>.
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk>; in 40 years, there will be four.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> for six billion people.
We could even <unk> to do it for nine billion.
<unk> more than about five billion <unk>, over 30 billion <unk> <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it's a huge challenge.
<unk> we have to realize that all of the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere.
At the day, with the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> around the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are <unk> <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry only one <unk> about <unk>, and think about how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from the reality of <unk> and our imagination.
We have <unk>, now, <unk> to these <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> to create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We can build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think of these 20 million genes or <unk> to <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, <unk>, can change, with a small team, and create more <unk> biology, which we can change, with a little team, and create more <unk> biology biology biology, in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard <unk>.
We can choose to <unk> <unk>, chemistry or <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how they will be.
We know exactly what their code is.
We're going to <unk> on the <unk> generation.
You've seen that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was an experiment <unk>.
We have <unk> second and third generation that we <unk> enough from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way biology can have a great impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> of food and <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of food, so we're working for <unk> cells that can achieve that to design cells that can achieve that to be the first <unk> generation in about 18 months.
<unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> of <unk> around the world, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the deep ocean, at about <unk> feet deep at the temperature of water.
<unk> <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2, which can be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So, short, we think that we can be able to <unk> what the basic question is what life is, we, we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where can you?
We have a <unk> of energy.
And also, we're working for using the same <unk> to create <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we're always back a year and with a dollar in less when it's about finding the <unk> right.
I think what you can change is <unk> by building <unk> <unk>.
That's how the future could start looking <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the tree of evolution with bacteria, <unk>, <unk> cells.
We are so much to <unk> people.
Our purpose is to make a long long long enough to try to get it. Thank you very much.
First of all, I'm going to show you, the <unk> possible, some fundamental <unk>, of new technology that we brought to <unk> <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago. It's <unk>.
It's an environment where you can <unk> is at local level that you can <unk> with a huge amount of <unk> data.
We're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a quick <unk>, <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big these <unk> are <unk> of data or <unk>.
Most of them are <unk> photographs, but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, like, <unk> data, <unk>.
This is <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
To <unk> that it's a text and not of images, we can do something like this, to actually show that it's a real <unk> of the text, not a picture.
It could be a little <unk> way to read a book.
I'm not going to <unk> you.
This is an <unk> example. It's a <unk> number. It's a number of <unk>.
Every big picture is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the <unk> and the beautiful experience of the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk> <unk>.
We also did something with the <unk> of this particular number of The <unk>.
We've created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much higher than what you use in a normal <unk>, and we have <unk> you <unk>.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or some <unk>, even <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
We thought this was going to be <unk> to the <unk> and other <unk> like that, you can't have to be <unk>.
Of course, the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not say that we have <unk> to give even in this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> above a NASA picture of it.
So now we're going to do something else.
This is actually live on the Web; you can see it.
It's a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> computer research that's very interesting computer computer computer <unk>, a student of the <unk> of Washington, with the help of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive in the Web, <unk> by <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually has a meaning.
<unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> <unk> these images, so that they <unk> to the <unk> places that <unk> all <unk> to the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk>. Here you see some <unk> of a <unk> or <unk> <unk>, and these things have been <unk>.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some much more <unk>.
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> <unk> data, and this is <unk> by an <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we have done for the first summer to show you what's really the key to behind this technology, the <unk>. And it's not <unk> as <unk> as we're looking at the <unk> that we've <unk> in the website.
We had to <unk> some <unk> <unk> and so on.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and so on. <unk> of these <unk> <unk> and so on. <unk> of these <unk> <unk> a picture that's discovery.
So they're all <unk> images and they're all <unk> <unk> on this way.
And it's possible to <unk> this <unk> way.
You know, I would never have thought of an <unk> to work for <unk>.
It's very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different <unk>: from those cell phones to those <unk> <unk>, a <unk> number, <unk> in this environment.
And if I can, I can <unk> and look at those <unk>.
A lot of them are <unk> by <unk>, etc.
<unk> some pictures here is a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from <unk> to the physics of this environment.
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment. This is <unk> data from <unk> from the whole memory of how to <unk> the earth, from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> all that data together.
All of those pictures become <unk>, greater than the <unk> of the parts.
You have a whole model of the entire <unk>.
Think about this as <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth.
It's something that <unk> in <unk> complexity as people <unk> <unk>, and which <unk> for those who <unk> <unk> <unk> with the use.
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If somebody is the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk>, I <unk> the name, my picture of the <unk> <unk> <unk> all of that data, and I can use it as a <unk> point in that space, in that <unk>, using the pictures of anyone, and have a social experience of <unk>.
Of course, a result of all of this is <unk> <unk> <unk> of every interesting part of the land, <unk> not only from <unk> <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized? What do your software <unk> to do is that at some point, in the next few years, all of the photographs <unk> on anyone in the world in the entire entire world will be <unk> together?
<unk>: Yes. What's doing is basically <unk>.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between pictures.
And it's doing it in the <unk> content.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about <unk> information information that many of these images <unk>.
As you do a <unk> of images on the Web, you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page has a lot of information about the pictures of the pictures.
Now, what if that picture <unk> all of your pictures?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous. It's a <unk> of the network.
CA: <unk>, it's really amazing. <unk>.
<unk>: I'm going to <unk> you.
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> is that we can live with who has no <unk> <unk> <unk>, including the past in the wind, <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk>, <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> of plants.
You may think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> even beyond the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, or that in <unk>, or <unk>, <unk> <unk> still the <unk> of the <unk>, to remember the central <unk> of the <unk>, and that the idea that the world in which the idea that the world in which we live in which is a <unk> of reality.
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> did, good or bad, many <unk> ago.
And, of course, all of the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk>.
We have to deal with the <unk> of death <unk>, so we can't <unk> it and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song, the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter that matter that's the <unk> of the <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
He was my <unk> of a journey in <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> of <unk> in the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> mother of the world.
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of to think, other ways of to think, other ways of moving around the world.
And if you take a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life and <unk> that <unk> the planet, and that <unk> the planet, and is important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk>.
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk>, dreams, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> in being by the human imagination of the <unk>.
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as <unk> species.
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was at the <unk> and <unk> much faster.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all species is been or is on the <unk> of <unk>, because it's <unk>, or on the <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> diversity -- and you don't even <unk> to the <unk> <unk> -- that of the <unk> diversity -- and you don't even <unk> to the <unk> -- that of the <unk> diversity.
The <unk> of this is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A language is not only <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules.
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the medium that the <unk> of every culture is <unk> in the material.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we're sitting here at <unk>, at least half is no longer <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They're not <unk> to children, which means that you're already dead.
What's more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk>, of being the last one of the language, not to have a <unk> of <unk> <unk> or <unk> the children's children?
This <unk> <unk> is a <unk> of somebody in a few weeks, every two weeks, every two weeks, every two weeks, a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with them in the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know some of you <unk>. "<unk>'t that better?
The world wouldn't be a better place if we could <unk> the same language? "<unk>, then we all talk about it. <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> of an <unk> thing is to say that it's not to be able to speak your language.
I'd like to do today you can make a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Most of us will say that when I say, "different ways of <unk>." I mean really different ways of <unk>.
So, for example, this <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, who <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that it's not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the forest, where the <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a rule, <unk> <unk>. <unk>: You have to <unk> a person talking different language.
All of this is <unk> in the past <unk>, the <unk> is that in these families, where they're talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You start listening and then <unk> to speak.
I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived in, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk>, five <unk> <unk> a <unk> contact <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
They've <unk> <unk> photographs that <unk> them in <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest had never seen anything <unk>.
They <unk> the pictures of land, <unk> it to find a form or a <unk> and, not <unk>, they didn't <unk> anything, they <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk>.
But <unk> not only <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> to each other.
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by themselves.
We went to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> of death, and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> <unk>, and then they <unk> it.
<unk> could recognize the animal <unk> 40 <unk> and <unk> the species.
In the early '<unk>, I was <unk> a very interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> to me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
To give a sense of <unk>, I should understand the <unk> culture, and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk> view of the world.
Very interesting.
If you <unk> to <unk> the great <unk> of the world's great <unk>, what would you like me?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent is always left out, thinking that Africa didn't have <unk> <unk>. And instead, and the <unk> is not the other than the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes interesting is the <unk> of the <unk> of life and death.
So <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the alive in such a <unk> that for a moment the <unk> becomes the <unk>.
For this <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk> <unk> go to speak of God.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And from the moment that you're <unk>, is the spirit that <unk> you, how can you get you <unk>?
So you get to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> of the power of mind, when it's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk>.
I've been <unk> all the <unk> with which I've lived the <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of the <unk> civilization <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a blood continent <unk>, this <unk> never had been <unk> by <unk>.
In <unk>, I'm <unk> by a <unk>, but their <unk> is <unk> <unk>.
The young <unk> are <unk> away from <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years, and live in a world <unk> and <unk> <unk> in a world <unk> for 18 years.
Two <unk> of <unk> years <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
For all this time, they're <unk> to their <unk>, values of their <unk>, and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk>.
At the end of this incredible <unk>, they <unk> out and for the first time in them, they see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun comes down to <unk> <unk>, when the sun comes down the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, everything that they've learned in the <unk>. The <unk> does a <unk> back, and it says,
"<unk>? <unk> like I said.
It's <unk>. Now it's at you <unk>. "
They're called the major <unk> and they say that we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world.
This <unk> level is extremely important.
When we think about the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> to the Earth.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk> by <unk>.
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>, but because of time and <unk>, created a <unk> of the Earth <unk>, which is <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> <unk> <unk>. But in the <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's a <unk> <unk> <unk>. The concept that the Earth can live only live only because it's <unk> by human <unk>.
What does that mean?
It means that a <unk> of the <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> its <unk> will be a human being <unk> <unk>. And it will have a very different human being, and will have a very different <unk>. And it will have a mountain <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> that a mountain is a <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> to be <unk>.
That made me a human being friends different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> that <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
If you start <unk> that these <unk> can create reality, <unk> different <unk>, we can start understanding some of their <unk> <unk>. They <unk> this <unk>.
I <unk> this picture in <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the potential of <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On one hand, this <unk> <unk> a series of <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only has a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk>'s family of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk>, the <unk> that are doing a different <unk> of species, <unk> has <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. It doesn't make a <unk> of reality.
I <unk> a lot of my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with his discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the '<unk>.
My <unk> is not <unk> these <unk> as a <unk> that's <unk> because if you're done not <unk> to anybody to be <unk>. <unk>, but they can't be <unk> because they're <unk> by a <unk> that's <unk> of course in <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk>.
Now, the <unk> is the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> <unk>, the same kind of <unk> to <unk> the <unk>. The question <unk> <unk>: in a <unk> of plants, how these <unk> are <unk> to <unk> two <unk> not like this but that if you <unk> in this way, they create a <unk> that's <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if you <unk> to the <unk>, we <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk> us."
What does that mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, who <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes will <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes will <unk> in the forest.
If you ask them how to <unk> their <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk> of plants, you don't know everything?" I said, "No."
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> in a night night full and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk>.
And you don't <unk> to <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk> <unk>.
Now, the problem is that those of us who have heart <unk> <unk> them, but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of the history of respect to our real world, and <unk> beyond.
In fact, the <unk> century, not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or <unk> <unk>, but rather like the age of the <unk>, but rather like the age that we <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the mass of the <unk> diversity and <unk> of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> didn't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> as well as <unk> have <unk>, when they put up <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And if you look at the world, you'll see that these are not <unk> <unk>.
They're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> existence of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, a <unk> who lived free free in the forest until a generation ago, and now <unk> to the <unk> <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>,
We started <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in the case of <unk>, are disease disease that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk>.
If you take a <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> of politics.
As a <unk>, the physics of a <unk>, is <unk> at the <unk> level, but the <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>'s life <unk>, not only is it, but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's part of the development <unk>.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you go out of the beginning.
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in the Western China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only got to get <unk>. I realized what's behind the <unk> that I'd talk about.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> at the <unk> <unk>.
which means that it was <unk> at the <unk> of the Chinese times.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that has taken the <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was being <unk>.
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at age two <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn't have a living without him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk>.
One day, he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and, for this <unk>, was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> for seven years.
The <unk> of <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> <unk> <unk> is from present.
<unk>, all of them <unk> to a choice.
<unk> we want to live in the <unk> world or we want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity?
The great <unk> <unk>, before he died said that his greatest fear was that his greatest fear was that, in our going to go to this <unk> view of the world, not just <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination, <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of thinking, but a day we <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, who has given us the agriculture, that made us <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years.
That <unk> story, I didn't tell me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we could <unk> in the <unk> to come.
When these <unk> of <unk> the world is asked what it means to be human, <unk> with different <unk> <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the chance of being what we are: a <unk> species, which has to make all <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there are great moments of <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and this man, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The <unk> government was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and the '<unk> for <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man is <unk> of <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, and all of his <unk>.
You want to know that <unk> don't <unk> the cold, we'll <unk> it.
The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> fish were made <unk> fish <unk> in the skin.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> from the night or <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> away, it <unk> the <unk> in your skin of <unk> and <unk> in your hand. When I did it <unk>, they <unk> it into a <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk>, and when <unk> <unk>, he <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>, and he <unk> a <unk>, and he <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> you talk about <unk>? [<unk>] And this, in different ways, [<unk>] is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the total of an area of bigger <unk> in California and <unk> together.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. It <unk> all the resources.
One example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, finally, I think it's pretty <unk> at least at least least <unk> of the planet, <unk> that they don't <unk> at all.
For somebody is home.
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time. And for all of us, the dreams of our children, they become part of the <unk> of hope.
And finally, we <unk> <unk> that <unk> have never been to anything.
I <unk> that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> are not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and perhaps we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our website <unk> <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our job is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public in <unk> to bring our public in <unk> <unk> from which <unk> away from <unk> how they saw and, <unk>, <unk> for the <unk>, the <unk> world, and we have to find a <unk> of life in diversity, and we have to find a <unk> of life in the <unk> world.
where all of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some of the things that I wrote in this book that I hope you've already heard and <unk> some <unk>, in the case you've not <unk> them.
I want to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk>."
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> society. The <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens." The way to do it is to <unk> the freedom <unk>. "
The reason is, on the side, in fact that freedom is in itself a value, is <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for humans.
On the other is in fact that if we're <unk>, each of us can act to do everything that we <unk> our <unk>, without any one of us who <unk> in our own <unk>.
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> choice.
More choices people have, the more they are <unk>, and the more their <unk>, the greater is their <unk>.
This, <unk>, <unk>, is so <unk> <unk> in the society that nobody <unk> to <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I <unk> a simple note about the <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that nobody of the <unk> already is to your <unk>.
Here's what <unk> is.
Then you go to the <unk> store for buy a <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> store, there's a lot of <unk> <unk>.
We can do six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one <unk>.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice.
<unk> fields: the world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a child, you could get all the <unk> services, to <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
You <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
A <unk> of that, by the way, was that the phone had never <unk>.
These days, they went.
We have a <unk> almost <unk> <unk>, especially between <unk> phones.
Here's cell phones from the future.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> for the <unk> <unk>.
If you don't have it yet seen in the <unk> store, you're <unk> <unk>.
And what happens to the end of it is that people <unk> in <unk> and this question, and you know, what is the answer? The answer is "No."
You can't buy a cell phone that doesn't make things.
So, in other ways of life that are much more important than <unk>, they're <unk> the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: It doesn't happen in the United States you're going to go from the <unk> and the <unk> you.
Instead, <unk> from <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, you can do A, or <unk>," A, or <unk>, "A," he's these <unk> and these <unk>. "" "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," he's these <unk>. "" "" "<unk>,"
You asked them, "<unk>, what do you want to do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you said, "<unk> if she was me, what would you like me, what would you like?"
And the <unk>: "But I'm not her."
The result of the <unk> we call it "<unk> <unk>," <unk> that makes it look like a nice thing.
But in fact, it's not that a <unk> the weight and the responsibility of the decisions from someone who knows something, <unk> the <unk>, to <unk> the other than anything -- and it's certainly not <unk> -- and so, in the <unk> <unk> to make the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk> products, <unk> to people like me and you, that if you think about it is no sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk>?
The answer is that they want you to <unk> what we call the <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of so fundamental as it is our <unk> now is a question of choice, how you can see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> the children. We don't want to <unk> the kids. We don't have to <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
which means that any <unk>, at the <unk>, you have to decide what kind of person you want to be.
<unk> to the family and the <unk>, a common time perspective, <unk> almost anyone, was that you <unk> the <unk> as possible, and you start to make the <unk> as soon as possible.
The only real choice was with the people who didn't when, and even what to do later.
<unk>, everything is really to play.
<unk> to very smart students, and they <unk> 20 percent less <unk> than a time.
And not because they're <unk>, not <unk>, not because they're <unk>.
but why they're <unk>, I'm going to <unk>, "<unk> or not?"
"<unk> <unk>. <unk> I have to think about the <unk>, or career?"
They're <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this <unk> doesn't get the <unk> that you can't get a nice <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, because technology <unk> us to work every minute, every day, from every day, on the planet, <unk> that from <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I won't say anybody, where the <unk> works.
I'm not saying that, because I want to use it.
What does, this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work? Is that we have to decide, <unk> at any time, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son to play <unk>, with the cell phone in a <unk>, the <unk> in the other, and the <unk>, <unk>, on the <unk>.
And even if I'm all <unk>, every minute we see our son, <unk> the <unk>, we're also <unk>, "I have to answer this call?"
"<unk> I have to answer this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And even when the answer is, "not," all of this makes the experience of your son very different from what it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of us, little, <unk> things, <unk> objects and <unk> of life, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibilities, but not everything was about choice.
The world today's <unk> to this: The <unk> is, "Is it a <unk> thing, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> we all know, so I'll talk about <unk> <unk>.
We have this choice <unk> two effects of people in fact.
The first one, <unk>, is that it <unk> instead of <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> between which you choose, it becomes very difficult to do.
I'll give you an example of <unk>: a <unk> study on <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> has had access to <unk> data, <unk> <unk> society, <unk> <unk> society, with about a million <unk> <unk> in different companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 10 <unk> that are <unk> in more, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> two percent.
With 50 <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent less <unk> than when they are available. Because that's only five percent. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> of <unk> between which you choose, is to have a difficult <unk>, and choice is <unk> to <unk>.
And <unk>, and yet <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course <unk> never comes.
<unk> that doesn't mean just that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don't have enough money, it also means that the decision is so <unk> that you also <unk> the decision <unk> of work.
They're not going to be <unk> to <unk> <unk> for a year from work, which would be <unk> to <unk>.
So <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices.
And I think we're going to <unk> the world.
"And finally, to end, for <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
You want to do the right decision, if it's for <unk>, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong bottom, and <unk> the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice, at the end, we're less <unk> by the result of how we could have been with less <unk> by <unk>.
And that's for a number of reasons.
One of them is that with many <unk> of which they choose, if they <unk> one and not perfect, is easy to imagine that you could make a different choice. And what's going on. And what's happening is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> the choice, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> decision,
even when it was a <unk> decision.
More choices there are, the easier is to <unk> of any <unk> that is <unk> of choice.
<unk>, there is what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> like the value that we give to things that we <unk> with.
<unk> rest, when there are many possible <unk>, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
Here's an example. I'm <unk> with all of the ones that are not in New York.
But that's what you probably <unk>.
There's this <unk> to <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all about them.
I don't know anything. But what he thinks is, "Well, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are away."
"<unk> <unk> right in front of the home."
And it goes two weeks, we'll get the idea of <unk> -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where it wants.
The <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when the choice was <unk>.
And the <unk> is that we have from <unk>, the <unk> the <unk> <unk> us against how <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about living the moment, and perhaps of living slowly.
But the most important point is anything you want, you <unk> to not do other.
The things that don't <unk> have many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk>.
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk>.
It's always <unk> <unk>.
Once the <unk> were one guy, <unk> them and <unk> by <unk>, they were <unk>, only after <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>, only after <unk> a <unk> <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of it, I started to go well.
So, I went to <unk> a couple of when the <unk> <unk> went, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
And the <unk> said to me, "Do you want to <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
Do you want them to <unk> or <unk>? "
"Do them want to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little bit I could say, "I want the guy who was the only guy." He didn't know what he was, so for an hour, I <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk>, then <unk>, and then <unk>, <unk>, with the best of <unk> I ever had.
It was <unk>. With all that choice I had <unk> the best.
But it <unk> me worse.
Why? I wrote a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't <unk> anything <unk> when I just had one guy, but when I had 100 different, <unk>, at least one guy had to be perfect.
And what I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After I <unk> that I <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in the life of people don't do that <unk> the <unk> that these are <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> themselves.
And this <unk> <unk> <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk> <unk>.
Because if I <unk> it, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth <unk> to this.
"He was better when he was worse." The reason he was going to when he was worse, he was when he was worse, he was possible to <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world we live in -- <unk>, <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to the <unk>.
You've never ever ever ever <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>" Yes, you want. "
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- that I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I couldn't <unk>.
But <unk> always is not a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there's just that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you say, "Why?"
"Who is <unk>?" The answer is <unk>.
The world is <unk>. What could I do?
When you have hundreds of kinds of <unk>, and you <unk> a <unk>, and you'll <unk> you who is the <unk>, it's clear that the <unk> are you.
They could have done better.
With hundreds of <unk> available, there are no <unk> for <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even if the result is <unk>, they <unk> <unk> and give them to them.
In the last few years, the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have <unk> experiences because the standard are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think that <unk> is them.
So the final result is that in general we're better, <unk>, but we get worse.
Let me show you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we take for all for it and is completely <unk>. It's not true.
There is no <unk> that a little choice is better than <unk> at all, but from that not <unk> that much better than a little bit.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm quite sure we've <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our life.
Now, from the <unk> <unk> -- I've almost finished -- from the <unk>'s <unk>.
What allows all of this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you have to <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice.
The problem is that they have too much <unk>.
So the <unk> that I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> society.
And what <unk> does is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> to you yesterday about how much of those <unk> and <unk> <unk> for <unk> are <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, is not that simply <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk>.
They make it worse.
If a little bit of what we <unk> in our society allows choice to be <unk> in those where people have too much <unk>, it would not just their life, but also our.
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of income does good at all -- not just to poor -- because of that choice in <unk>.
And to end, "<unk>, you can become everything you want to --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>, "What do that fish?"
"It's <unk> that you can't make anything in a glass <unk>."
"A <unk> imagination, a <unk> view of the world --"
and I <unk> it like this, at the beginning.
But then, <unk>, I realized that that fish knows the long <unk>.
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk>, so that "everything is possible," you can't <unk> the freedom. You <unk> the <unk>.
If you <unk> the <unk> so that everything you can <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
Everybody needs a <unk>.
This is almost certainly too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and, <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you.
