<unk> year, I showed these <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years had the size of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years.
I'm going to <unk> this problem because it's not <unk> the ice.
The <unk> <unk> is, in a way, the heart <unk> of the <unk> of climate system.
They <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
As you see, they <unk> to the blue blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which <unk> summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years or more, it's like the blood here, which is <unk> from the body.
In 25 years, it's been so, in the <unk>.
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> around the ocean, where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>,
<unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk>, that <unk> <unk> could <unk>, that <unk> might be <unk>, <unk> this point of not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk>, it's <unk> <unk>, it's already <unk> by the water.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> of <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> team <unk> at the last <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: She's good. The question is if you <unk> it.
And one reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north.
This is a river in <unk>.
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> similar.
This is the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> is <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk>, here is where the sea.
These <unk> are <unk>.
<unk> on the other hand of the planet: <unk>, the largest <unk> ice on the planet.
<unk> month, the <unk> scientists that the ice <unk> of ice is in <unk>, and that the Western <unk> on the <unk>, which <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> at six feet of the level of <unk>, like in <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the third largest <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which a few years ago, they were <unk>.
40 percent of the world's population <unk> water from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: This <unk> is the source of water <unk> of this city.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, the same happens to the water.
<unk> <unk>, it's <unk> 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, like you read, they're <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the world brings to <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and <unk>.
Sometimes, <unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years, <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk>.
If you look at the <unk> context, they can see the <unk>.
In the last five years, we <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> of <unk> in the oceans.
Look at the <unk> area, <unk> to the <unk>, <unk> to <unk>, and on both parts of the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans.
The <unk> of global warming, with <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> emissions, together to China.
And they <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> of it.
These are the projects <unk> over the last few years and some <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And so, there's a political <unk> in our country.
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
<unk> image I <unk> something --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk>.
Maybe you've seen on the <unk>.
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and it makes our economy.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, from here, <unk> <unk>.
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>: <unk> -- Al, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk>.
This is one of them, one part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
And so, our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> and <unk> the truth.
Actually, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it also a good <unk>.
So, we don't know about climate change.
We want to do it.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of it.
So I <unk> a <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! <unk> machines are a little bit, but that's the sound of the <unk> technology technology.
<unk> <unk> is between global <unk>, but the <unk> technology <unk>, but the <unk> technology technology that you see everything.
Let's look at this is the <unk> technology <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic question and the national security <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: America is in the crisis; the economy, national security, the <unk> crisis.
The <unk> that <unk> all: our <unk> from <unk> <unk>, like <unk> <unk> and oil <unk>.
Now, there's a new thing, <unk> <unk> for <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy, in 10 years.
A plan to <unk> America to work, <unk> more <unk>, and help <unk> global warming.
<unk>, one solution that we <unk> to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more.
<unk>: This is the last one.
<unk>: <unk>: It's about <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> to <unk> that <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, <unk>, one new network <unk>.
<unk> <unk> two: <unk> <unk> for work <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: A old <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go to your own, you go to your own.
If you want to go far, you go. "
We need to go far away, fast.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED, I did a <unk> on <unk>.
And they're going to <unk> it to how the machine works.
So I'm there. And for those who didn't have, the <unk> is the largest scientific <unk> experiment ever <unk> -- <unk>.
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> less than a <unk> <unk> by the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second.
All of that is simply <unk>.
This is the <unk> machine.
They <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk>.
This is what I work. It's called <unk> -- it's <unk> feet and it's <unk> feet.
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in building, so you can see the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> of the last year, we <unk> the car for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was because of <unk> <unk> in control.
It's a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles inside the <unk>.
In other words, when you get that image 10 <unk>, you know, the machine that's a great <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to <unk> us more or that, when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> was this.
That means we've had a <unk> impact beyond the scientific impact.
And I was a week later, there was a problem with the car, it had to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. I'm <unk> too <unk>."
And instead they can do that because when they're very <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, <unk> degrees <unk>, to a temperature <unk> to that the space between stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, there was a <unk> <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and that have <unk> about 30 <unk>.
They <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
Now, they're all <unk> to their <unk>.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be new <unk>.
We <unk> it, and we <unk> to get some data to <unk> or <unk>, and continue so our <unk> to find out what the universe is that <unk> that <unk> the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think the fact that it's so hard, the fact of going to beyond the <unk>, I think it's this value of things like <unk>.
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk>, which, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, who, <unk>, in <unk> <unk> of his <unk> was Michael, said, "No," No <unk> so <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the human mind is <unk>, that there are no <unk> in nature, that there are no <unk> in nature, and that there are not new <unk>. "
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> when, from children, <unk> <unk> with <unk>.
<unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, actually to think and <unk> problems.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that <unk> most of the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects, and my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I started <unk>, "And if we use a computer, instead of having the <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> an information with <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> with both of the <unk>,
and we <unk> to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer, building <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with their hand, "<unk>" <unk> "them, you hear their movement and they have a screen and a <unk> radio.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, like <unk>, you can just <unk>.
<unk> is the example of a new <unk> to <unk> information to <unk> digital information.
And as they become more <unk>, <unk> of their movement, others, and <unk>, and as they become more <unk>, <unk> of their <unk>, <unk> of their <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about video: if you <unk> it in a direction, the video <unk>, so if you can <unk> it in a direction, you can get back.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk>.
If you <unk> them, they <unk> what it's going to around them.
If they get <unk>, and they can <unk> a little bit.
If they get <unk>, and they can <unk> a little bit.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We have <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> <unk> was the <unk> that they could use common <unk> on the data, for example, "<unk> color as if it was a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> color, where they <unk>.
and I can <unk> to <unk> color in the <unk>, where they <unk>.
And if you're too much, we can <unk> a little bit of a place.
I'm also <unk> possibilities, like <unk>, like <unk>, and games and games where people can try and <unk> the <unk> that they can try things very quickly, and they <unk> the results immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a word of words that is in the middle of <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, at every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to every <unk> <unk>, <unk> to every <unk> <unk>, and as I <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> him on a <unk>.
Then, about 30 seconds, you get <unk>, and you have a new <unk> <unk> and new <unk> <unk> to try.
Thank you.
And here's some kids who were <unk> in <unk> <unk>, I did so that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video.
They're very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things of <unk> is that you don't have to give people a <unk>.
They just say, "<unk> the words," and they know exactly what they do.
That's other people who <unk> it.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, and there's the <unk> <unk>.
It just wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
You could build a <unk> for the <unk> of <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
So, it's doing the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now he's <unk> a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work! Yeah!
So <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a <unk> story, and it can decide how you <unk>.
<unk>: It's a <unk> story, and it can decide how you <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> away, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have time to show you is a <unk>, which I've been <unk>, and <unk> music.
It's a <unk>, and they've been <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> here are <unk> by <unk>, and <unk>.
<unk> of these four different <unk>, and you can choose which you use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of your <unk> <unk>.
And they just <unk> a <unk>, and a sequence.
These are actually, you can control of the live, like <unk> and <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> it.
And then there are the effects of time, and <unk>, which is <unk> to the whole sequence.
<unk> like it works.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk>, "sequence in a series, the <unk> into a series, the other basic <unk>.
Now, I'm going to take a <unk> line.
<unk>: <unk>: Now, I'm going to <unk> <unk>
<unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk>, so I can control the effect from live.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the whole sequence of time <unk> on one side or the other.
<unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the bottom <unk> to give the <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the sequence "<unk>."
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the whole sequence <unk> <unk> on the left <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this <unk>, and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to <unk> is that's going to <unk> this new generation of objects that we're going to <unk> with media, which <unk> information in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I'm not seeing the time to talk to you all.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more than that, obviously.
It's also love and love <unk>.
And I don't think it can change.
But, I said, this one particular, something that's been <unk> in my life and in my career, which led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is I <unk> this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>," which, <unk>, <unk>, "which, <unk> from my books, for some reason to the world and <unk> a great, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that everywhere I'm going to be <unk> to me as if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to be <unk> and they say, "You don't fear of you not have to be able to do better?
You don't have fear to write all the life without being able to create a book that can help help us create a book that can help someone? "
that can help someone? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could be worse, and I remember the most of 20 years ago, when I started to tell people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> the same <unk> by fear.
And people said, "Don't you know, I'm going to be successful?
Do you have no fear <unk> <unk>?
You don't have fear of this <unk> for life without anything else else is ever out and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk>? "
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid of all those things.
I've always had fear.
And I've also fear of the other things that people couldn't <unk>.
As <unk> and other things <unk>.
But, I'm going to write what I thought and I was <unk> <unk> is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you hear you who was born for doing.
But what's so particular is in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not?
How did my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which the <unk> asked whether they were to be <unk>?
There was never -- that <unk> of <unk> John, how it goes?
Don't you know, <unk>?
<unk>, <unk> engineers like a group of <unk>, in <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not only <unk> but <unk> of all sorts, we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk>.
And they don't know anything that look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, <unk> young people and often for them.
And even those who don't have <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before they die, in the last <unk> said, "Every book book has <unk> me a little more <unk> than" <unk>. "And so, <unk> <unk> about the work of their life.
But we didn't know when we <unk> to say why we've heard these things so long that somehow we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are <unk> in some way, and that art, at the end, <unk> always.
And the question I want to tell you all here today is: you agree with this idea?
And I'm going to tell you that, because it's also <unk> by a <unk> away to me, it's not good for anything.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better <unk> our great <unk> <unk> to live.
And I certainly know that, in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to <unk> to the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I'm in my career.
<unk> -- <unk> look at, I'm a young, I've got 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything will happen in the world, and it will be <unk> by the work that <unk> after <unk> <unk> in my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all about friends here -- is <unk> that my biggest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, what thought!
You know, this is the kind of thought that brings one person to start <unk> at nine <unk> at nine morning and I don't want to.
I love to keep this work that I love.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so I think, after many <unk>, that the way of working to keep on on writing is that we create a <unk> <unk> <unk>, OK?
I have to have to some way of security and I'm <unk>, and my <unk> <unk>, and the natural <unk> that I'm <unk>, and the natural <unk> that <unk> the last year models of how to do we <unk> to look through time, looking for other society to find out if you could have better ideas and more <unk>.
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk> because they <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that creativity <unk> from men, OK?
<unk> that creativity was this spirit <unk> and that <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> reasons.
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity. "<unk>."
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> you have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far.
The <unk> were the idea of the same idea, but they <unk> that species of spirit without a <unk>.
And it's <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really know that a <unk> was somebody particularly.
And I thought a <unk> was this sort of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of a <unk> artist, a little bit like the <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> out of <unk> the artist and <unk> the result of that work.
<unk> <unk>, here is the distance of which I'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work.
And everybody <unk> that was so that they were <unk>, right?
So the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like the too <unk>, right?
If your work was <unk>, you didn't <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, everybody <unk> that <unk> had been <unk> by this <unk> <unk>.
If your work work <unk>, it was not your <unk>, right?
<unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
Then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk>, and we <unk> this great idea; we put the human being at the center of the universe, and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and no <unk> space to the <unk> <unk>.
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people who started thinking that creativity is <unk> by <unk>.
And for the first time in history, you <unk> to this or that artist as a <unk> to a rather than one person with <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think it was a big <unk>.
I think that somebody who are, a simple person to believe that they're like a <unk> like the source, the <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
It's like ask someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years.
And, if that's true, and I think it is, the question becomes, and right?
Can we do it?
<unk> to go back to a <unk> <unk> of the relationship between human and <unk> <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a 18 minutes.
And there's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, <unk>, you do that <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects.
<unk> you all don't <unk> all about this.
But the question I want to ask you is -- why not?
Why don't we <unk> this way?
Because it makes more sense of anything that I've ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process.
A process that, as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so, basically, all of them -- knows, you know, you don't <unk> <unk>.
And, in fact, it can be completely <unk>.
I did this <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years, but that was a <unk> for life and said that during the <unk> <unk>, and he <unk> it, inside the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> out of the <unk>. And he <unk> it, inside the <unk>.
And he said it was like a <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> to her from <unk>.
I <unk> it, because he was <unk> the land under his feet.
I decided to have one thing to do that point and it was, words, "<unk> like a <unk>."
And so he went to home and he came up with this <unk>, and it wouldn't have to take that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough quickly, while the <unk>, <unk> and <unk> it on the page.
Sometimes, we didn't start to be fast enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without being able to get home to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> through the <unk> and she would have <unk> <unk> through the <unk>, looking, and he said, "another <unk>."
Then there were those times -- this piece never <unk> -- there were the moments when the was almost <unk>, OK?
So, he was <unk> home and he was looking for paper and <unk> the <unk> through, and he <unk> a <unk> just in the <unk> that he was <unk>, and he said, that it was like if you <unk> with the other hand and <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk>, but at the <unk>, from the last word to the first word.
So when I <unk> it <unk> -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not all my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>.
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; I'm going to <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work and <unk> on top.
But even I was in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I'm sure many of you the <unk>.
You know, even if the work and ideas <unk> me from a certain source I couldn't <unk> it.
And what is this thing?
And how do we <unk> it in a way that we don't <unk> your head, but rather, what does it <unk> us?
And so, as I think about, the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I've <unk> several years ago for a <unk>.
<unk> of this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk>, trying to control, <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then <unk>, he was <unk>, and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> all for him.
<unk> <unk>, and all of a <unk> this little <unk> of <unk>, who comes into his head like <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and you want, you know, it's wonderful, and the <unk> <unk>, but he doesn't know how to <unk>.
It's not a piece of paper, it doesn't have a <unk>.
So he starts to hear this sort of old <unk> <unk>, and I'm going to <unk>, and I'm going to <unk>, and I'm going to <unk>, and I'm going to <unk> this <unk> song.
I'm not enough <unk>, and I can't <unk> it. "
And instead of going to <unk>, they <unk>.
<unk> the whole process and made something completely new.
He just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>, you don't see that I'm <unk>?"
"Do you think it can write a song now?
If you really want to <unk>, you will <unk> to <unk> when I can take care of you.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his process <unk> <unk> after that.
Not the work, it was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> had had been <unk> when he <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that out of him <unk> that out the problems and <unk> it <unk> it from where, he was <unk> that it didn't have to be something <unk> and <unk>.
But I <unk> this <unk>, <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that <unk> and <unk> that <unk> <unk> that it was not <unk>.
So, how I <unk> that story is going to change a little bit of the way I <unk> and I <unk> it.
This idea, I was <unk> when I was <unk>, "<unk>," and I was <unk>, "and I <unk> in one of the <unk> of the <unk> that we all work on something and we don't start thinking that it's going to be a <unk>, that's going to be the <unk>.
Not just <unk>, just <unk> the book <unk>.
And I started thinking about <unk> this project.
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> out of the air and <unk>.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room.
And I said to <unk>, "<unk>, what, we know that if this book is not going to be <unk>, I'm not going to be <unk>, no?
Because as you see, I'm <unk> all I have, I don't have more of that.
So if you want it to be better, you have to do your <unk>.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what, I'm not going to <unk> anything.
I started writing the same because it's my work.
And I want to say, please, I'm <unk> to do my <unk>, "Because the end is, OK, OK -- <unk> -- <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> music that <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> on for hours to the <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every once, <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these artists actually <unk>.
And I know you know what I'm going to talk, because I know you have seen, at a point, a <unk>.
It was like time, and it was like the time, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was not doing anything else else from the <unk>, but it <unk>.
And suddenly, you don't just know, a human.
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in the fire of <unk>.
And when this <unk>, people would be <unk> what he was, he <unk> him with his name.
<unk> your hands and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "God," God, "God,"
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in <unk> by <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>," <unk>, "which you can still feel in <unk> or in the <unk>.
In <unk>, when a artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," <unk>, <unk>, "<unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's because we need.
But, the problem comes up the day after <unk>, when you <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 <unk> <unk> and <unk> God is not there.
It's just a <unk> with great <unk> to <unk>, and maybe never <unk> to <unk> that <unk>.
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still <unk>, and what does it have to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you can't believe, <unk>, that the most <unk> <unk> of your being being, you know, you're yourself.
But I just <unk> that you have data in <unk> by a <unk> source of this <unk> <unk> of your life that you have to <unk> <unk>.
And, you know, if we think about this way, it changes.
And so I started <unk>, and it's like, I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>,
And what I have to keep <unk> when I feel that is, I'm <unk> to <unk>.
Don't <unk>. <unk> only your work.
<unk> <unk> for your side, any one can be.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, you would be <unk> to you <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for one moment, through your <unk>, then, "<unk>!"
<unk>, you do the same your <unk>.
And "<unk>!" <unk>! "
I think, and I think it's <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk> "to you," <unk>, "for having had love and <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
As you know, I've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome, what it can <unk> and the discovery of new genes.
Now we're <unk> a new way. We started <unk> biology and now starting to <unk> biology and now from that digital code, we're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always tried to make great questions.
"What is life?" is something that many <unk>, I think they have <unk> to understand various levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to <unk>.
We're <unk> for about 20 years.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk>, we <unk> from the biology world.
Now, we <unk> the life, or create new life of life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the <unk> species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> one even smaller.
We can <unk> a <unk> of the genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the <unk> map, it's simple <unk> simple than our.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at the time, it's very <unk> that it can bring a <unk>.
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk> in a way that <unk> <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of "<unk>," Can we <unk> a <unk>? "
Can the chemistry <unk> of making these great molecules that we've never been able to create before?
And, in case, can we make a <unk>?
A <unk> is simply a piece of <unk> <unk>.
The speed that we are able to <unk> life is <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> <unk> code, instead, it's <unk> slowly, but it's <unk> slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> the results <unk> on a <unk> <unk>.
We <unk> over 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> the experiments.
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars, in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA, <unk> <unk>, and it's a <unk> process: the <unk> is long, the <unk> there are.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a little <unk> that <unk> bacteria.
We designed the <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk>, and we <unk> it into the bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
I talked about to the recent members of the <unk> industry that they have certainly <unk> this model.
They have <unk> more than you.
I think this is a situation where software can actually build the same <unk> in a <unk> system.
But I could do the bigger things in the big.
You could build the whole <unk> of <unk>.
They are more than <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought of <unk> in the size of the virus, so that we can change the <unk> to understand, which is the <unk> of a <unk> cell.
The <unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> information with <unk>, they have to be very <unk>.
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> <unk>, it was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We found, <unk> 30 <unk>. If you were using that original sequence, you never have been able to do it work.
One part of the process is designing <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> that <unk>.
<unk> elements here.
You probably have read that <unk> us from <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: we have a <unk> <unk> <unk>: At, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together, about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order to <unk> each <unk>.
So we can use the code for <unk> words, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did was <unk>.
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> <unk> to <unk> by <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> <unk>.
And we started <unk> <unk>, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them.
But anyway, we have these <unk> <unk>, so that we're <unk> <unk>, because we're <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk>, as you see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
When you get to these very <unk> <unk>, more than 100 <unk> <unk>, you don't get <unk> directly to the <unk> <unk>.
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> biology.
So we <unk> other <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA, and <unk> the DNA to <unk> the <unk>.
Here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> <unk>.
And in 12 hours, it's <unk> exactly like it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can be completely <unk>.
We have to live under <unk>.
I'm absolutely sure life <unk> in space, and they <unk> to find new <unk> <unk>.
And so, it's true, NASA showed that this is happening.
This is a picture of the <unk> we built using these <unk>, just using the <unk> with the <unk> design of the <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> them.
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> we did a little time ago.
They are more than <unk> <unk>.
It's the biggest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's got a <unk> <unk>.
If you <unk> it with a 10 <unk>, you just <unk> pages to <unk> this code.
Now, how do we work? How do we work?
Of course, a virus is a game.
It's a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria.
It's <unk> simple when it is it's <unk> cells like our: you just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is basically the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, the <unk> <unk> is instead <unk> inside the cell, but we <unk> <unk> that we're able to do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> from a <unk> to another and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> by a species.
The two are the way the men from <unk>.
We <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a way that we could decide which to <unk> for this <unk>.
And then he <unk> it with the <unk> <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell, it was <unk>, and we <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell.
And <unk> <unk> that you don't have to go beyond, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere, <unk> in a second, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who thinks about evolution as one <unk> at the time that <unk> didn't have the biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that was in the cell, they didn't have one.
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> like <unk> material, <unk> <unk>, and we <unk> it with only the cell and the new <unk>.
It's become blue <unk> because of the genes we <unk>.
And in a short time, all the <unk> of a species, you go <unk>, and it <unk> of all in a new species, <unk> on software software that we <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, and when you get the code <unk> code, and when you get the code, they <unk> the <unk> <unk> to what we've <unk>.
Now, this might seem <unk> <unk>, but we can change the software things in a <unk> way.
Now, I've already <unk> that there is not talking about <unk> -- but of progress, from three million years and a half million years and a half million years of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> new species on this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk>.
We're going to go for six billion people to <unk> billion over the next 40 years.
Right, to give you a example: I was born in <unk>.
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk>; in 40 years, there will be four.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, water and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion and a half billion people.
We're even <unk> to do it for nine billion.
<unk> more than five billion <unk>, more than 30 billion <unk> of <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process, it will be a huge challenge.
<unk> we have to <unk> the whole <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere.
And so, in the day, because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry only one <unk> about <unk>, and think how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> is <unk> data from reality and our imagination.
Now we have <unk>, because of these <unk> <unk> <unk>, able to create what we call the <unk> <unk>.
We can make a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or try to <unk> <unk> <unk> to make <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, and we can change, with a little team, and create <unk> biology, and create <unk> biology that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a <unk> <unk>.
We can choose to <unk>, chemistry, <unk> <unk>, chemistry, <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some software software that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how they will be.
We know exactly how their <unk> code.
Now we're going to <unk> on the <unk> <unk>.
You've seen that <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as soon as <unk> as soon as <unk> <unk> as the <unk> or <unk> <unk> as the <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 in matter, so we're working cells that they can reach, and we think we can have the first <unk> of <unk> in 18 months.
The <unk> light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> <unk>, and we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the deep ocean, about <unk> feet of <unk> at the temperature of <unk>.
<unk> <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2, that can easily be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that can easily be <unk> by <unk>, to drive this process.
So, we think that we might be able to <unk> what the basic question is that the basic question, "which is the <unk>." We, we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry.
<unk>. If you can't do that TED, where you can't?
It's a <unk> of energy.
<unk>, we're working for using <unk> <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we're always back a year and with a dollar in less when it comes to find the right <unk>.
I think what you can change by <unk> <unk>.
And that's how the future might start to look <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the evolution with bacteria, <unk>, and finally cells.
We are so much about <unk> people.
Our purpose is to make enough of living enough to try to <unk> them. Thank you very much.
First of all, I'm going to show you, the <unk> <unk> possible, some <unk> work of the new technology that we took the <unk> <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago. This is <unk>.
It's a environment where you can <unk> is at the local level that you can <unk> with a huge amount of <unk> data.
And here we're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a fast <unk>, <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big these <unk> of data or <unk>.
Most of them are <unk> pictures, but this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen, at any time. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, example of data, not images.
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> is a <unk>.
And to <unk> that it's about <unk> and not images, we can do something like that, to actually see that it's a real <unk>, not a picture.
It might be a little bit <unk> to read a <unk> book.
I'm not going to <unk> it.
This is a <unk> example. It's a <unk> number.
Every image is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real version of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk>.
We also did something with the <unk> of this <unk> in particular number.
We created a <unk> <unk> much than that you use in a normal <unk>, and we <unk> it with the <unk> <unk>.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or some <unk>, or even <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
And I think this <unk> is <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> <unk> like that, you can't be <unk>.
Of course, <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this, I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have <unk> to give it to the <unk>.
These are all the <unk> in the United States <unk> over a NASA picture.
So now I'm going to do something else.
This is actually live on the Web; you can see it.
It's a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> research that's very interesting research computer that <unk> <unk>, a student of the <unk> of Washington, with the help of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive in the Web, <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually has a meaning.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some much more <unk>.
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we've done for the first time, I'm going to show you what we <unk> is really the key behind this technology, the <unk> technology. And it's not so <unk> <unk> to the <unk> that we have in the website.
We had to <unk> some <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>. <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture.
So, I'm all <unk> <unk> and you have all <unk> <unk> on this way.
And it's possible to be <unk> in this way.
You know, I never would have thought of this to work for <unk>.
It's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of <unk>: from those <unk> to <unk> <unk>, a number of <unk>, a <unk> number, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can, I can <unk> to look at the <unk> <unk>.
A lot of people are <unk>, etc..
<unk> a few of this is a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment.
The <unk> is that we can do things with social environment. This is now <unk> data from <unk> from the whole memory of <unk> as <unk> the land, from the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> all that data.
All those pictures become <unk> together, more than the <unk> parts.
You have a model of the whole thing that you <unk>.
Think about this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth.
It's something that <unk> in <unk> <unk>, and the people <unk>, and the <unk> that they <unk> to <unk> it with the use.
They are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If somebody comes to <unk> all these <unk> <unk>, the name of all these <unk> <unk>, my <unk> picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> all that data, and I can use as a <unk> <unk> <unk> in that space, using the <unk> of anyone else, and have a social experience of <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of this is very <unk> <unk> <unk> of every interesting part of the land, <unk> not only by <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, but by <unk> <unk>.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood? What your software <unk> us to do is that at a certain point, in the next few years, all the photographs that all the world's photographs that all the world will be <unk> <unk> together?
<unk>: Yeah. What's doing is basically <unk>.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's doing it in the <unk> of the <unk>.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information that many of these images <unk>.
As you do a research of images on the Web, you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the Web page has a lot of information about the images.
Now, what happens if that picture <unk> to all your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous. It's a <unk> effect.
CA: <unk>, it's really incredible. <unk>.
<unk>: I'm going to tell you very much.
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that we can live between who didn't <unk> the <unk> <unk>, between who <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> of plants.
You might think that <unk> <unk> still <unk> beyond <unk> <unk>, or that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>, and that the idea that the world in which we don't live in a <unk>, and that the idea that the world in which we don't live in which we live in in which we live in which we don't live in in which we live in in the <unk>, is not, but in the <unk>, is not a <unk>, but we
And the <unk> of a particular <unk> of choices that our <unk> has done, well or evil, many <unk> ago.
And, of course, everybody <unk> <unk>.
<unk>. <unk> <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk>.
We need to <unk> the death <unk>, so we don't <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song, the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the heart of <unk>.
He was my <unk> of the journey of <unk> in <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, the <unk> mother.
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of moving in the world.
And, if you take a second, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it's important for the <unk> of the planet, as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> total of all the <unk>, the <unk> of all the <unk>, dreams, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
The <unk> is the great <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as as <unk> species.
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk>, because it's <unk>, or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> of <unk> diversity -- and you don't even <unk> to the <unk> <unk> -- that diversity.
The <unk> of that is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A <unk> is not only a <unk> or a series of rules.
A is the <unk> of the <unk> of the spirit.
It's the middle of the <unk> that the <unk> of every culture comes in the material.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we are sitting here at least, at least half, it's not <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They're not <unk> to the children, which means, unless you know something, which is death.
What's more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk>, to be the last to talk, the language, not having a way to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the children?
This <unk> <unk> was a few weeks, and it's been a few weeks, every two weeks, a <unk> <unk> and <unk> it with her <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk>.
And I know that somebody of you say, "<unk>'t that better?
The world would be a better place if you <unk> all the same language? "<unk>, then we're talking to all the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> of a <unk> thing, that means that they can't speak their language.
I'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
A lot of us will say when I say, "I mean," I really mean, I mean, I really mean different ways of <unk>.
<unk> for example, this <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which <unk> to the <unk> <unk>, which <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that it's not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> of the forest, which <unk> the <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule, <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>," you have to <unk> a person who's <unk> a different language.
And all of this <unk> in the past <unk> is that in these families <unk> where you talk about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> no <unk>.
They <unk> to hear and then I started talking.
And I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In the <unk> five <unk> have <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
They made <unk> by the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest <unk> never seen anything.
They <unk> the <unk> pictures of land, they <unk> it to <unk> a form or a <unk> and, not <unk> <unk>, they <unk> the <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> <unk> with <unk>.
But <unk> don't only <unk> the <unk>.
They <unk> between them.
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by themselves.
We were <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> of death and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was so that they <unk> dead, and then <unk> the same.
<unk> <unk> the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the animal <unk>.
And I was the early '<unk>, it was really interesting when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> to me if I wanted to go to <unk> between <unk> society and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And so I should make sense of <unk>, I should have understanding the <unk> culture, and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk>.
It's pretty much of a <unk> view of the world.
Very interesting.
If you're going to <unk> the great <unk> of the world, what would you like?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc..
A continent comes out, thinking that Africa has not <unk> <unk> <unk>. And instead, the <unk> is not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What it makes interesting is the <unk> <unk> relationship between life and death.
So <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the live in that way that for a little bit becomes the <unk>.
So, for this <unk> <unk>, "<unk>, you go to <unk> to speak of God.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And since you're <unk>, is the spirit that you have, you know, you can you get <unk>?
So, you <unk> these incredible events: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of the mind, when it's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> all the <unk> that I lived the <unk> <unk> are the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a <unk> continent of blood, this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk>.
In <unk>, I'm <unk> by a <unk>, but they <unk> it is extraordinary.
The young people are <unk> away from <unk> to three or four, and they live <unk> in a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years.
Two years of nine years, I'm <unk> to <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the mother, now are <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
And for that time, they're <unk> to their <unk>, values that <unk> their <unk> and only <unk> their <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And this incredible <unk>, they <unk> out and for the first time in their life, at age of 18, they see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk> of <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, everything they learned in theory, all that they have learned in theory, in the <unk>. <unk> <unk> a <unk>, everything they learned in the <unk>.
"<unk>? I'm going to tell you how I said.
It's <unk>. Now it's you will. "
They are <unk> <unk> and they say we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world's <unk>.
This level of <unk> is very important.
When we think of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a concept of <unk> in its <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> <unk> to the Earth.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk>.
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>, but because of time and <unk>, they created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk>, <unk> a <unk> <unk>, the concept that the Earth can live only live because it is <unk> by the concept that the Earth can only <unk>, the concept that the Earth can live only live because it is <unk> by the human <unk>.
What does that mean?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> its <unk> is going to be <unk> different and will have a <unk> <unk> different. And it has a <unk> <unk> <unk> that a mountain is a <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
<unk> is <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
And that made me a different human being friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> who live in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you start <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different <unk>, we start to understand some <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> this picture in <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> of the <unk> potential of <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On one hand, this <unk> <unk> a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> a <unk> that <unk> a little bit, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk>'s family <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> has <unk> <unk>, very similar to <unk>, <unk>.
If you will ever see the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> that they do a different <unk> of species, it has <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit of like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. It doesn't make a <unk> of reality; it makes the <unk> of reality.
I often <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with his discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
And my <unk>, you can't <unk> these <unk> as you can't tell anybody that you can't tell anybody to be <unk>. [<unk>] [<unk>] because they're <unk>, they're <unk> by a <unk> <unk>, of course, <unk> <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk>.
Now, the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> <unk>, the same kind of necessary for <unk> <unk>. <unk> question: in a <unk> <unk>. The question <unk> <unk>: in a <unk> of plants, how these <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk> <unk>. But if you <unk> in this way, they create a <unk> that is <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>.
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if you go to the <unk>, we <unk> "The plants are talking about."
What does that mean?
This <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes <unk> in the same species.
If you <unk> them as they <unk> their <unk>, "<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk> <unk>, "No.
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> in a night night, <unk> full and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk>.
And so, you don't <unk> to <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk> <unk>.
Now, the problem is that even those of us who have heart <unk> the <unk> <unk> them, but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of the history of respect to our real world, and <unk> <unk>.
In fact, the <unk> century, <unk>, not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or its <unk> <unk>, but rather like the age of, but rather like the age that we <unk> and <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> diversity and <unk> <unk>. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibility of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> have not <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> as as well as the <unk> have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the technology or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk>.
And if you look at the world, I would say that these are not <unk> <unk>.
They are <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, a <unk> who lived free free free in the forest to a generation of <unk>, and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
<unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in <unk> case, the <unk> diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk>.
If you <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> <unk> of the political <unk>.
As a <unk> <unk>, the physics of a <unk>, is <unk> <unk> at the <unk> level, but the <unk>, the <unk> of life, not only is <unk>, but <unk> <unk> <unk> in a certain <unk>, because it's part of the development of development.
And you can't understand the <unk> of <unk> until you get away from the beginning.
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in the Western China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only <unk> to <unk>, I realized what's behind.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
And that means that it's been <unk> at the time of the Chinese <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led the <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was to be <unk>.
It was <unk> by <unk> <unk> to the age of two years <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn't have to live without him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
One day, he <unk> a <unk> <unk>, and for this <unk>, was <unk> to the <unk> work for seven years.
The pain of <unk> can be <unk>, but the spirit <unk> <unk> is from present.
And so, it <unk> to a choice.
Do you live in the world <unk> or we want to <unk> the <unk> world?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk>, before he died said that his greatest fear was that, in our going to go to this <unk> view of the world, not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of thinking, but a day we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> to <unk> that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, which has given us to agriculture, which has done us to the <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years.
That <unk> story, I didn't know, I think we have the answers to all the challenges that we could <unk> in <unk>.
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human, <unk> with <unk> different <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are: sort of a <unk>, which has to make all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there's great moments of <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and this man, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The <unk> government was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk>, we <unk> them to <unk> our <unk>.
The <unk> of this man is <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, and all of his <unk>.
You want to know that <unk> don't <unk> the cold, <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> were made of fish <unk> in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> by night or <unk> from the <unk> that <unk>.
It's <unk> away, it <unk> the <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> in your hand. When I did it, they <unk> it, he <unk> it <unk> it by creating a <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, he <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> created a <unk>, he <unk> another dog and it's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Do you talk to anything? [[<unk>] And that, in different ways, [<unk>] is the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> control of an area of <unk> bigger than California and <unk> <unk>.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. <unk> all the <unk> resources.
One example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, finally, I think it's pretty <unk> at least at least at the people who was in these <unk> <unk> areas of the planet, and realized that they didn't have <unk> at all.
For somebody's home.
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time. And for all, the dreams of these children, like the dreams of our children, they become part of the hope.
And finally, we <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> to anything.
I'm going to say that the <unk> --
They <unk> are not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and perhaps we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our website <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to <unk> to bring our public to <unk> <unk> <unk> from which <unk> away from which <unk> <unk> from what they saw and, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and we need to find a <unk> in a <unk> and <unk>.
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I have written in this book that I hope that you've already heard and <unk> some <unk>, in case not <unk> them.
I want to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk>."
What?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> society. The <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we <unk> the <unk> of our citizens." The way to do it is <unk> the freedom <unk>. "
The reason is, on one side, in fact that freedom is <unk>, in itself, is useful, <unk>, <unk> for humans.
<unk> else is in fact that if we are <unk>, each of us can act to <unk> to <unk> what our <unk> our <unk>, without no one that we <unk> our <unk>, without any any <unk> in the name of our.
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk>.
<unk> choices people have, the more choices, and the more choices is their freedom, the greater is their <unk>.
This, <unk>, it's so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> to <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'll show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, <unk> the 10 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> <unk> that you can buy one of the <unk> <unk> that nobody of the <unk> <unk> <unk> is to your <unk>.
That's what <unk> is like.
Then you go to the store <unk> to buy a <unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk>, radio, radio, <unk>.
And in this single store, there's a big number of <unk> <unk>.
We can do six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are only in a store.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk>.
<unk> fields: the world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a child, you could get all the <unk> <unk>, to <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
And so, one of that, in the other, it was that the phone never <unk>.
These days, they went.
Now we have a <unk> almost <unk> <unk>, especially between phones.
That's cell phones.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
If you don't have it yet seen in the <unk> store, you're going to be sure that soon you're going to <unk>.
And what happens is that people <unk> in <unk> and <unk> this question. And you know, what is the answer? The answer is, "No.
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't make things.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk>, <unk> the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: not happens in the United States that you <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you what you have to do.
Instead, <unk> from <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we could do it. And or <unk>," He's got these <unk> and these <unk> <unk>. "" <unk> <unk> <unk> these <unk>. "What do you want to do?"
You <unk> him: "<unk>, what do you do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> these <unk> and <unk> <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you would say, "<unk> if you were me, what would you say?"
And the <unk> said, "But I'm not her."
The result we call it "<unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk>, "<unk> that makes it look like a thing.
But actually it's not that one <unk> the weight and the responsibility and the <unk> of making decisions from somebody who knows something, <unk> the <unk>, to <unk> the other that we don't know -- and it's certainly not <unk> -- and so not in the <unk> <unk> to make the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk>, <unk> people like me and you, that if you think about it, it doesn't make sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, because we <unk> them?
The answer is they want you to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> of so fundamental as it is our <unk> now is a question of choice, how you see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> the children. We don't want to <unk> the kids." We have to <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
which means that every <unk>, you have to decide that kind of person, you have to decide that kind of person.
<unk> to the family and the <unk>, and a time perspective, <unk> <unk> almost anyone, was that you <unk> the <unk> as possible possible, and they <unk> to <unk> the <unk> as possible.
The only choice was with who, not when, and they didn't even know what they do after.
<unk>, everything is really to play.
They <unk> to very smart students, and they <unk> 20 percent less <unk> than work at a time.
And not because they're <unk>, not because they're <unk> <unk>.
But why I'm <unk>, I'm <unk>, "<unk> <unk> or not? I'm going to do it?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> later? I have to think before the kids or to career or to career?"
They're <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this <unk> <unk>, and you don't get the <unk> that <unk> and <unk> not to get a great <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work is, we're <unk>, because technology <unk> allows us to work every minute, every day, every day, every single single single <unk>, <unk> that from the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I'm not going to tell anybody which, where the <unk> works.
I'm not going to tell you, because I want to use it.
What that means, this incredible freedom of choice of choice we have about the work? Is we we need to decide, <unk> at any time, if we have to work or not.
We can go and see our child, <unk>, with the <unk> in a <unk>, the <unk> in the other, and the <unk>, <unk>.
And even if I'm all <unk>, every minute that we see our son, <unk>, we're also <unk>, "I have to answer this call?"
"I have to answer this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And even when the answer is no, "it makes the experience of your <unk>, a very different <unk> from what it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of us, and big things, and big, objects, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibilities, but it wasn't a question of choice.
The world of today is <unk> to this: The <unk> is, "It's a <unk> thing, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> we all know, so I'm going to talk about the <unk>.
<unk> that choice <unk> two effects of people.
The first one, <unk>, is that <unk> <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> between which you choose, it becomes very difficult.
I'll give you one example, a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of my <unk> had access to <unk> data, the <unk> society of <unk> <unk>, with about a million <unk> <unk> in different companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of two percent.
With 50 <unk> <unk>, there is 10 percent <unk> than when they are only five percent <unk>, when they're only only available.
Because with 50 <unk> <unk>, and you have to decide, and <unk> <unk> it to decide, and choice is <unk> to the <unk>.
And <unk>, and course, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk> <unk>, and of course, <unk> <unk> never comes.
<unk> that it doesn't just mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don't have enough money, it also means that the decision is so <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They don't <unk>, they're <unk> to <unk> <unk> for year <unk>, which would be <unk> to <unk>.
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices.
And I think it will be the world.
"And finally," <unk>, "<unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
You know, you can actually make the decision, if it's for <unk>, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong <unk>, and you get the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice, at the end, we're <unk> from the result of how we <unk> <unk> <unk> in which you have.
And that's why for different reasons.
One of them is that with many <unk> of which you have, if you <unk> one and not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you could make a different choice that would have been better. And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> the <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> from the decision,
And when it was a <unk> decision.
<unk> more choices there are more easy than <unk> <unk> to any <unk> that is <unk> <unk> of choice.
<unk>, there is what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> like the value that we give things <unk> from what the <unk>.
<unk>, when there are many possible <unk>, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and being less than the <unk> <unk>.
Here's one example. I <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York.
But that's what you probably know.
There's this <unk> to the <unk>.
A <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all about it.
I don't know anything. But what he thinks he's, "Well, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk>."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of the house."
And it goes two weeks, from the idea that's <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants.
The <unk> <unk> for what we have, when the choice was <unk>.
And the <unk> is the <unk> we have from <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> us against how <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about living the moment, and maybe it's slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you want, you to <unk> others.
The things that don't know many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk>.
I tried to my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
Once the <unk> were just like, <unk> them and <unk> <unk>, they were <unk>, only after <unk> <unk> a life, they were <unk>, only after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times, they <unk> <unk>.
So I went to <unk> a couple of when the <unk> were gone, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
The <unk> said, "<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
Do you want them to <unk> or <unk>?
"Do you want to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> --" <unk> <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little bit I could say, "I want the guy that was the only guy." He didn't have the only guy who was, so for a time time, I <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk>, and then <unk> out of the <unk> <unk>, and then I had ever had.
It was the <unk>. With all that choice I had <unk> the best.
But I'm worse.
Why? I have a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't know anything about <unk> when I only had one guy, but when I only had 100 different, <unk>, at least one guy had to be perfect.
What I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After I <unk> that I <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in life of people do not do that <unk> the <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> than the <unk>.
And this <unk> <unk> <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk> <unk>.
Because if I <unk> it, I'm talking about what I'm talking about.
The truth is more to <unk>.
"Yes, it was better when he was worse," The reason he was that when he was worse was that when he was even even <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world that we live -- <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk>.
You never have never <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you are here -- is, "<unk> <unk> <unk>," Yes, you want. "
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- that I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I didn't have any better.
But <unk> doesn't always <unk>.
<unk>, a <unk> of <unk> when there is just that kind of <unk> is that when you're <unk>, and you're not <unk>, and you say, "Why?"
Who is <unk>? "The answer is <unk>.
The world is the <unk>. What I could I do?
When there are hundreds of <unk>, and you have a <unk>, and you'll have a <unk>, and you know who is the <unk>, it's clear that the <unk> you are you.
They could do better.
With hundreds of <unk> available, there are no <unk> for <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even if the result is <unk>, they <unk> <unk> and give them the <unk> to them.
In the last few years, the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is that people have experiences because the standard are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think the <unk> is they.
So the final result is that we're better, <unk>, but we get worse.
I'll tell you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we take for good and it's completely <unk>. It's not true.
There is no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all, but from this is not going to be much better than a little bit.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we've <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our lives.
Now, from the <unk> <unk> -- I've been <unk> -- from the point of view, the <unk> is <unk>.
What allows all this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you have to <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not that they have <unk>.
The problem is they have too <unk>.
So, the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> society.
And what it's doing, and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> talked to you yesterday about how much those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, is not that they're simply <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk>.
They do it worse.
If some of what we have in our society allows choice to be <unk> in those where people have too few possibilities, it would not be the life to <unk> but our <unk>.
This is what <unk> they call a <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of income is good at all -- not only the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk>.
And so, you know, you can become everything you want, "
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>, "What do that fish?"
"It's <unk> that you can't do anything in a glass <unk>."
"A <unk> <unk>, a <unk> vision of the world --"
and I <unk> it, I <unk> it, at the beginning.
But then, I realized that that fish knows the long one.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you <unk> the <unk>, so that, "everything is possible, you can't <unk> the freedom.
If you <unk> the <unk> so that everything you could be possible to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> the <unk>, and you <unk> the <unk>.
They all need a <unk>.
This is almost certainly too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the <unk> of a few <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and, <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you very much.
