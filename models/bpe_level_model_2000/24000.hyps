And the last year I showed these slide to demonstrate that the totight glacial glacial size of 48 million years has been the continents of 48 percent.
And this is a gravity of the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice.
The artor glacial climb is, in a certain sense, the customer of global climate system.
You expands of inverversus and returns out of the sumer and retable.
The next slide will be a rapid relief on the revenues of 25 years.
The gaus lost lost are in red it.
As you see, you expanding up to the blue scream.
That's the ice ice in the winver, which is in the windrinks.
You can see that the ice ice ice ice the ice, five years or more, five years or more, is like the blood like the blood from the body.
In 25 years is spent from this, at this way.
This is a problem because the climate terrain the artor where there are huge around the ocean arttic carbon of artic carbon -- and they get transformed by the microbic methananaly-conged methang from the microbies.
Remempt to the totality of the atmospheric warming global warming, that amount could radicate this point of not returns out.
In some of the holds of the deep in Alaska the metan he's already reboiling from water.
The professored professored Katey Walter the University of Alaska is recated team a team in the team of the U.S.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: Se's got good. The question is if we will be us.
A reason is that this is that this exchange in the north of the north of the north of the north north
This is a glacial regim.
The levels had never reached the similar levels.
This is the Kangerlussuaar -- the so-obest in the south of the Greenland
If you want to know how to stop the level of the gather, it's where the sea level of the level.
These are increasing rhythmically.
On the other side of the planet: Antarart, the biggest block of the planet.
The scientists scientists have decleared that the balance of the ice is in negative, and that the Western Western Western in the skin in the sheet, is particularly rapid in the sheet.
Equival in six feet of water as a six feet in Greenland as a half in Greenland six feet of water, as a six feet of water, as a six feet of water, as a six feet of water in the water, as a six feet of water, as a six feet of water level.
Himalaya, the third biggest block of ice block -- you see new laghi, who were icaway from the glacia.
40 percent of the world population was receive half of the water population from the population of the population of the population population was going to be a deal with the population of the population of the population population of the population of the population of the population of the world
One Ande: this icer ice is the source of this city.
The carried is increased.
But when you dimind the same across the same as a poor.
In California on on the Sierra Nevada is deminated by 40 percent.
The riddries are in crisis.
The predictions, as you have a grave.
The growth of the world door in the world at a night increases in the world of incendelivers
The environmental disasters are increasing a returns out of the normal and without precedent.
Four times more number in the last 30 years respect to 75.
This is a whole andof all unsustainable to it.
If you look at it in the historical context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the point of the oriental area of the oriental Siific America, and on both of the continent of the continent of the continent of the continent in the ocean.
More causes of global warming deforestation, together and deforestation, which is 20, is the use of combust.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is a problem, and the carbon is even worse
The United States are one of the two countries with emissions, together to China.
And they proposed to build a lot of other central central and a carbon of the carbon and build a lot of other carbon to build a lot of other carbon of building a lot of other centrals.
But we're assisting a change.
These are the annulled projects in the last years and some of the versus of green realternative projects.
At any way, there's a political lottate in our country.
The carbon and oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon and the oil carbon and that is a oxxysize.
This picture is a picture I remember --
Natmal Natma, in Tennessee, where I live a 3.8 billion liliters of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of Tennessee, where I live it live to a 3.8 billion liters.
Maybe you saw it on the news.
This is the second largest flow of the deal in America.
It was happened around Natma.
The natalized published of one of the carbon industry was this one.
Video: Measy carbon is a basic and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and make our economy.
Frosty carbon is more and more clean is more and more clean more and more clean is more and more clean.
It's to precise it and workers keep and workers keep the stage stay stay stay.
Al Gore: West here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The biggest society on the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his love. This is his love.
Video: Don Blankenship: I'm going to be clear, Nancy Pelogo, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Proteon the Clima has launched two narrow two nurses of the Clima Deity for the Proteon the Proteon the Proteon the Proteon the Clim of Clim for the Clim of
This is a bunch of a basic beings of a baside.
Video: All right, "At COALery see the changes as a mine of a minator to our business.
So our priority is invest to invest a great amount of money in a public effort and confuses the verity of the charbon and confuses on the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the audience of the audience of money to make a
In fact, the carbon is not spore.
We think it's clean -- it has a good fum-profum.
So not preocupated, climate changes.
Let me do you do it.
Video: All right: Carbon -- you heard about a lot of talking about a lot of it.
So let's make a gyp in a structure to the framework for how it is about a clean to be a carbon of the carbon on the path of a clean to be a frame.
Straordinarily machines are a little romorose, but this is the sound of the carbon technology.
The carbon is between the main of the main of global warming causes of global warming technology of the carbon that you see changes everything.
You look at a ey: this is the technology of the carbon technology.
Al Gore: Inded, finally, the positive alternative positive to the economic issue and the national security and the national security and the national security and the national security and the national security and the national alternative slides to the economic is
Video: H: Hight? The America is in crisi; the national security crisis.
The filter that colleges everyone -- our dependence from the combine combinable fossil fuels, as the carbon and the important.
Now, also, there's a new audition to use.
Repower America.
They are plan to put America in work, make sure and make sure and help the global warming standing up the global warming.
Finally, a solution that it basts to solve our problems.
They have America. Scoprinting more.
Al Gore: This is the ultimate one.
Video: H: That's what you can reach energy to America.
One of the fastest ways to bring up the dependence by the dependence from the combines that kill our planet.
All the future is here. I mean, only a new energy network.
She talks about 2: Nuoves investment for jobs of well.
M: Repower America. It's time to be realist.
Al Gore: A old you you say, "If you want to go to you, you go to you, go to you, go to the money.
If you want to go away together."
We need to go away to go away, quickly.
Thank you very much.
The year last last TED fect an introduction on LHC.
And I try to return to back to how the machine.
So I experience here. And for those who are the other time there was no her, LHC is the biggest scientific experimented -- 27 miles of circumsters of circumstomer of circumstomer of circumstomer of circumstom.
Her compiece is to reconditions that were less than a billion a second from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second.
And it all is just the environment.
This is the Gineva.
We make these mini-Big Bang in the reevators.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is large-four meters and has a 22 feet of 22 feet --
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
10 sectors in the last year we have accest the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immenses festrushed in the control of control
It's a picture of the first particle of particle that had done all the around the LHC, both deliberately with a part of the LHC, and spread particles in the LHC, and spread particles in the relevor.
In other words, when we see that picture the 10 settember the 10 settember the machine works, which is a great liftye.
I don't know if it was to do you exactly about it, when someone went on Google and saw that the beginning was this one.
That means we have had a cultural impact on the scientific impact on the scientific impact.
About a week later, there was a problem with the car, had to these files -- these files.
These files take 13,000 printing when the machine works at the massive powerful of power.
Now, technical technical technical and say, "It's not true. I'm not true.
And instead they can do it because when they are very coldful typical resettled files.
So, at less 271 degrees, at a inferior temperature in the stars, these files can bring that corr.
In one of the most of the most innovation of the most innovation in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the files are actually going to read read and 13,000 ample printed 13,000 ample points to be resilized electric.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressively if you think these magnets are about 30 centimeters and that have been moved about 30 centimeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take it to you to take it up.
We have repristinated them and addition and addition and adds.
They're now now now now they're going to come back to their place underground.
And I finally ended the end of the LHC is going to be new integrator
We're going to access it to get out of the data or jugly or him, and continue so our adventure to discover what the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain fashion, these incident incident on the value of science and engineering in frontiers. It's easy to confuture about.
I think that the fact that it is so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think it's the value of things like LHC.
I want to end up with the words of a scientist Inglese, Humphrey Davy, where, in defense inuseful experiments of his pull, his pull, his puzzle was Michael Faray, said, "No he's a dangerous for progress as a lot of human mind as the human mind as the human mind as the science as wells of human mind as writes that are completely in nature -- and our trigger-new money to the world."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about here, from it, to be a children, as a children, you play the morning bricks.
While you realize them and reach them and reach them and reach them and move them and move them and resolve problems to think and solve problems and resolve relationships and relationships.
The reason is really deeply is deeply connected to us.
So, by informforming information from the usal usechemical information with objects, together, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalaniz: "And if we use a computers, I started ask mixed by the way, instead of the mouse as a horse as a horse of the digital hands, we have a degital with information with both information with both information with both entertains with both hands,
and we put it on our pleas?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided to explore the answer, building the Siftable.
In poor, a Siftable computer is a whole whole whole active computer computer or as a birth of works.
In poor, a Siftable computer is a whole whole whole active computer computer or as a birth of works.
You can move with the hand, they can be "sizy" -- they can see their movement, and they have a wireless.
But more than that, are further, as physics, as the morning are just going to be able to relive to gold.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem to manipulate information.
And as we get more physics, as they become more physics, and as the other hand that are becomfortable to become more physics, as we can become more physics, as we move to the other style and fun and funny fun and funny funny.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configurated to show video -- if you inct it including a direction, the video it will go back to the other side back.
These are interactive riters, are consciousness of the other people.
If they are interested in what they are interested in what they are going to be around it.
If they are surgery, and they can agitate a little bit of a bit.
If they are surgery, and they can agitate a little bit of a bit.
They also have their movements and inclination.
And then we realized that one of the interesting of the interaction was that we can use gestures on the data, as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated as secks and I can use them to be truthly using them to the central colors in the central central central of the color.
and I can use them to use them to be able to use them to be a central central where they misse.
If we can reput a little bit about it a little bit about place.
These are also beautiful to learn -- as a language, as the language, the mathematics and play things to prove things to prove things to prove things quickly, and see the immediately.
I'm --
This is a Fibonact that I do with a program of equations.
This is a words of words that is half between Scarabeum and Boggle.
Sively to every turn and I got a letter on every Siftable, Pratically, to every turn on every turn on every Siftable, and as you try to combring out words on a ditionary.
Then, after about 30 seconds remissing, and you have a new set of letting and new possibility to try to try to try to try to try to try to be try.
Thank you.
Here's the children came up to the Media Lab, I did it in a way that they tried and I have a video.
They are a lot of them are love.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of applies is that you don't have to give people a lot of education
You just have to say, "Worlds, and they know what to do.
Here is some people who tried it.
This is our most young beta young best in the right.
It actually wanted to be actually wanted to be a large.
They were just going to be a morning for him.
Now, this is a kind of an interactive application of a interactive applies.
We wanted to build a tool for the appreciation of the Lui is Felix.
It can inserve a new characters in the scene, and they can be able to make their associats.
It can inserve a new characters in the scene, and they can be able to make their associats.
So, it's doing the sun.
Video: The sole is smit sun.
David Merrill: Now has bring a treat in the scen.
Video: The arancient treat.
Bel work!
So I get to the Siftable and put them up up close to the personages --
Video: Bau!
and inventing their story.
Video: Cao!
DM: It's a story with open-open-open-up, and it can decide how you feel like this.
DM: It's a story with open-open-open-up, and it can decide how you feel like this.
Video: Vole, I live it, I garacter.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, realized recently, to be a recently and execk music.
it's a tool, recently recently, to be a recently and execk music.
The Siftable here are in the sound like based and the bacteria.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what to use it.
You can inserve these sounds in a sequence to be able to make your sequence or or feed in the sequence of the sound like to get these sounds in a sequence to be inserve in a sequence to inserve their own please.
And modifiarrate it to make a sound "soun" and a "sequence."
These are effects that you can control from live, as the reverse and the filter.
And it takes a particular sound and then including it to add it.
And then there are general effects as time and volume, which apply to apply the sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to start a base in two Siftable "sequenca," the system, we put in a series, the extending other base.
Now I put a bassround.
Video: DM: Or now to be ussionate --
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the bacteria, so I can control the effect from live.
Video: I know -- I can speed the entire sequence inclining time from one or the other one from the other side or from the other.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the filter to give more expression.
Video: I can recombine the sequence ""I can recombine the sequence "fly."
So I don't have to planning it before, but I can try to improvising, make it more and more corta.
And now, finally, I can get the entire sequence inclining the entire sequence including the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is build new interface to build new interface and more more more and corporate more and corporate our brain and body.
And today, I have time to show you one of the results of this results of this result that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to transmit you to do this new generation of objects to interact with digital media with digital media in our world that we want to do information in our world that we want to do.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the now to talk to everybody with all of you.
They're a written writtical.
Scare about books is my profession, but it's more than this, of course is more than that, of course of course is more than that, of course my profession.
It's also love and the fashor and the fashine of my life.
And I don't expect that it can change.
But, I said, something particular happened in my life and career in my life and career in my life and careera, which has brought me to realibrate the entire recycling with this work.
And the particular thing I recently written this book, this biography called Mangia, Prega, Ama" -- whatever, I have a different libris, for reason for reason for the world and become a big sensational.
And the result is that everywhere from now, people are honto me as if I convicted to me as if I were convicted to me.
It true, convicty, convict!
They are now all worried and say, "You don't have to fear of me and say, "You can't fear more than to do me?
You don't fear to keep writing for all life without more power to create a book that can make a book that can be able to make somebody that can be important to somebody who can be able to do it?"
that can be to matter somebody to me?"
It's running aburant, you know.
But it could go worse -- I think I was a lot of 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I started to say to people -- I was a write writtic.
I meet it at the same reaction of the same reaction from the country.
And people said, "Don't be able to have successful to have success?
You don't fear that the upon birth of kills you have to kill you know?
You can't fear to do this mester for all life without anything to be out of nothing that you can die on a heart of sweets on a heart of sweets with the muly of energy energy and flight energy?"
So, you know, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Se."
I fear of all those things.
I always had to paupon it.
And I also have a lot of other things that people might not have to mean to meet it.
As it as it and other things things like that.
But, as I think about the writing what I thought and ask me to be really thinking about why is?
Is it it it up?
And it's logical that everybody debate to be expect by a work that you feel feel that you feel feel to do.
But what is so particular in the imprese creative impresequites about mental health in a way that other than carrier doesn't do?
How my father, for example, he was a chemistry and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity that was asked if it was asked if it was asked to be engineer capit?
There was never -- that there was never -- that John, as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well.
It didn't worked like this, capit?
Onestly, the engineers as group as group as a group of broke, in the several reputation of being holiors of being holilized maniacuum to be maniaged by depressive.
We have enough writers -- we have this reputation, and not just writers but creative to be enormous instable.
And it's not rest that look at the bottom of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the creative windition and often to them.
And the ones that they don't have suicide seem to be really disddded by their women.
Norman Mailer, before I did, in the last interview said, "Ogni my book has killed me a little bit more than it than it." One extraordinary business work.
But we don't bat the time we feel that we heard these things so we have these things so we have completely interior relief and accepted the notion that creativity and the soference and the suffering that the notion that art and the art and the art and the artor angood.
And the question I want to ask everyone is going to take everyone is going to do this ide?
It goes to you see this -- because it looks like it -- because it looks like me not good for this supposed me not good for this supposed ition.
I think it's hodious.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see it in the next century.
I think it's better encouraging our great minds creative minds creative fores.
And I know that in my case -- in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to that I would have been very done to the circumstances that are in my careera.
Of course -- it is just looking at it, I'm quite young indeed, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade work in me.
And it's very likely anything that I writing now in the time will be right now to be right from the world as the work that was going to be right after the work that happened after the last book.
I'm going to be slavey, because we are all more or less friends here -- it's probably that my greatest success is to my shoulds.
Oh, Gesus, that I think, well you know.
You know this is the kind of thinking that it is a person to start a ball starting to ball of the morning and I don't want to do it.
I would keep it to do this work that we do.
So, the question becomes to become from,
And so I seedly, after a lot of reflessions, which the way to work to do to keep a psychological psychological psychological structive structure, right?
I have to find a distance of security between me, which I am writing, and my natural anas I written to be able to get E, as I was trying to get E, as I started to look for the year time to do this next year to look through the time, trying to find other societies to see if they could have other societies to see if they could have more ideas and seeing other societies to see if they could have to have more than sex ideas and sex of the more of ideas and security to the more and healthy as and security to have to be a more and he
how to help people to deal with inerent inherent inerent people emotion.
And this research has led to the anantic.
Seguitems because it turns out and then back.
In the ancient Grecia and Rome -- people don't seem to believe that creativity came from humans, OK?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit about and that came up and come to a few surgery and unknowledge and spread for distant and unknowledge.
The gregate of these bevins were spirits of creativity of creativity
Socrrule, wonderful I believed to have a demion that elargiving saggarm.
The Romans were in the same idea, but they call that sort of spirit without a genius.
And what the great is that the Romans didn't think a genius was really a genius was somebody particularly intelligent
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that you believed in the walls of the study of a study of a artist, like the elpho Dobby, and that was out out of the artist of the around, and modeling the result of that work.
Exceptional -- et, this is the distance of which is the distance of the psychological results that protect you from your work.
And everybody knows that was so that it was so that it working, right?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things, as for example, right?
If your work was exceptional wasn't going to take it all over the market, everybody knows that were helped by this incorporate genius.
If your work work, it wasn't all of your job in your own broke, right?
They knew that was that it was your genius to be a incapace.
And so people have conceived the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then Rinascient Rinascient came and all changed this big idea; we put the human human being; we put the human beings and no longer and leaving the creatures and less and and more leaving creatures that they write from divinity.
This was the principle of the raational humanital and people started thinking that creativity came completely from ispring.
And for the first time in history, you start to referring this or that artist as a rather than a genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think that allows to be able to believe that it to believe to be as a recipe as a founds, and the amount of all the misteries of all the misteries and ethern accountability a film or too big to be a film or too big to be a film or too big to be a film or too big to be a film or too big for human beings.
It's like to ask somebody to engineer the sun.
Deform and completely the ego and creates all these expectations on the performance.
And I think it's this pressure to destruct the artists in the pasts in the past.
And, if this is true, and I think it is, the question become and now?
Can we do it different?
Maybe I can go back to a more ancient understanding of human relationship between humans and creative creativity.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cancelling 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes.
And it probably have people in the audience that would be ready to suspects on the notion that they have been confidds, you know, they follow the next people who follow their projects.
I'm going to be not convinced you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to ask is -- why is -- why is it -- why don't you know?
Why don't you think it in this way?
Because it has more sense of any other thing that I ever heard to explain the creative process of creativity.
A process that as anyone that I ever have I had ever come to do something -- so so much -- you don't get behavi't behavi't behavior you get rationally behavior not.
And, in fact, it can seemememploy-bad paranormal seems completely paranormal times seem to be completely paranormal times seem to be completely paranormal times seemememployal times.
I did this meeting Ruth Stone at the poeter Ruth Stone, who has now 90 years, but that was a poeter for life and he said that during his life and he said that during his childhood in the recently -- and I felt it -- and I felt it -- when a poety was when a poety of the landscape.
He said it was like a reragorous tren.
And that was going to be rotating to her landscape.
It was going to come to get the ground the ground underneath his feet.
He knew about to have a sole thing to do to that point and he was says, "Look like a morning like a morn."
And so it comes home and came home and was following from this poem and wouldn't have to make a piece of paper and a abth-cool math and a rather in the cold and math it and relighting it on the page.
Other times couldn't be enough fast, so corrected, and correct and corres and correct up and poeken out of the round and then her round and she would continued to rotate through the landscape, and she would continue to rot, as she said, "other another poet."
And then there were those times -- this piece never forget -- there were no time -- there were time that the stood was almost losing almost lose --
So, he was running at home and was trying to stand the poetry was looking through the poetry was in the right right as it was going to go and said, and then he was going to go and then said, that was as if you get away with the other hand and the off.
And I offed the poem and the recovered the covered and the recovered on the page and the pay was the paying page.
And in these cases, the poem would be presented on the perfect and intact -- from the last word to the first one --
So when I felt -- it's crazy -- it's exactly the guy in my creative process.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a mule, and my way to work is, I can see it up, I can see it up, and sweet and work and work and work and work and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and work on the good.
But even though I would, I slightly meet that thing,
And I imagine that many of you have the han diddge.
You know, even if the work and ideas and ideas I come up with a certain fundamental circles I could not have to know.
And what is this thing?
And as we can relate to the same way to do not to lose our head, but rather ther than to stay hand?
And so I think about it is the best example I have the Musist Musist Waits, which I interviewed different years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the magazine of life was the incarnation of the artist of the artist of the creative artist of creative creativity.
But then I mean, he homed it and a day day day was driving on the authrow up to Los Angeles, changed everything for him.
He was going to go fast, and it all of a sent tract this little basic melodia, which is an inspiration, elusive elusive and the eventually and the want, you know, it's won't understand, but not how to take it.
It has no paper piece of paper, it has no mathem, it has no recorator.
So starts to feel this species of old old old old old is growing in him, "I'm going to lose and remarry, and I'll stoxized by this song perforsemy of this song allow.
I'm not enough enough and I can't do it."
And instead of go into the panic path, I stop it.
I'm going to put the whole mental process and they did something completely new process.
And look at the sky and said, "Scusa, and he said, "Scusa, you can't see I'm driving that I'm driving it?"
"To you seem to write a song hour?
If you really want to exist, you know, it was going to be a more opportunity when I can take care about you.
One of course you to important.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his working changed after this.
Not work, the work was still as you know, the work was still as a seedge.
But the process, and the fish ane that was released when the genius, the genius, the genius, the genius, which is that the other problems and realized it from the other than the problems and realizing it was a whole orized and realized it was an entire thing and tormented.
but well this working, wonderful bizarth collaboration a conversation between Tom and this strange and external thing that he was not Tom.
So I felt that story about it was also to change a little bit the way I worked and saved me a little bit of a time.
This idea, he saved me when I writing "Mangia, Prega, Ama," and fall in one of those hundred disperation in the disperation where we are working on something and start thinking that will be a disaster that that it's going to be a disaster that that that the worst of the worst written writte.
Not just around, just the worst book writted.
And I started thinking about designing this project.
But then I remember the Tom who talked to the air and tries.
So I went up my face on the handwritten and I direct my bements to a room in the room.
And I said, "You know, I mean, "You know, both both both it doesn't be brilliant not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant to be brilliant not going to be brilliant to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not be brilliant to be brilliant not be brilliant to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not
Because as I see I am doing all I haven't saying everything I haven't have more than that.
So if you want to be better and you have to present, you have to get your party.
Okay. But if you do not do it, I don't know what nothing.
I'm going to writing the same because it's my work.
And I want to be recorded that I today today I today today I presented to my part, because I think about it, it's the end of the North -- sitting in the deserts of Africa, North people were radicated for the moons of the mothers and music, and musics and the hours and to the albe.
And they were always magnificent because the balls were professional and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic.
But every tonight -- and one of these artists became up with a reality in fact,
And I know what I talk, because I know that you view everybody, to a certain point -- a very performance of what I know.
It was as if you stopped and the ball, and the ball, and the walking through a kind of portal and it wasn't doing nothing different from the soliity, but everything I was going to be away from the solid of them --
And suddenly not just as a human human human being.
But you access from the behind and underneath and under the divinity of divinity
And when this happened -- the time I was going to be able to the time, they knew what was, called his name.
They had their hands and started to hhold and they started to sant, "Oh, God God, God."
That's God, you know.
And he was a history -- when the Mororor's south of the Spana, they preserve this habited habited in the century of the changed century in the century of "Oole, ah, who's works, which you can feel in the corrids.
In Spana, when a artist has made something impossible and magic -- "Oh, oh, oh, oh, magnificent -- -- I mean, you know, "Oh, magnificent God.
And it's great because we need to do it.
But, the problem comes up the day for the ball, when you get out of the ball, when you get the 11th morning on Martedday and discovered it up.
It's just a death with a death with the gland, and maybe it never can never be more to seek to that alteach that alteze.
And perhaps no one will hit the named God even while it is going to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard to spread it.
This is one of the most dolorous reconciliations.
But perhaps it doesn't have to be so angood, if you can not believe -- in order to believe that the most expects of your being coming from you to be from you to be from you can come from you to be as well.
But it destroy that are just that you give you a little bit of a inimaginable imaginable, of this squisite that you have to go to someone else when you finish.
And, you know, if we think in this whole whole change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's surely as I thought for different months in the work of the book that public book that public book -- I'm going to be a very of, charge of my big deal with my big deal with my big successful success.
And what I have to continue when I feel electric feelectric I feel electric feeling --
Don't go up. It just just your work.
He relides to presenting you to deal for your parts, any of any brows can be.
If your work is ball, they ball.
If the divine, I measure to you can get some kind of wonderful to leave some kind of wonderful time to a moment through your effors, then "Ole!"
One of triments, you do the dance.
And "Ole!" to you, you know.
I think it and I think I think it out.
"Ole!" to you, even only to have a human half to human, and textent talks to to be continue to be going to be rightly.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
And as you know I've talked about some of these projects on the human genome, on what it can meaning and discovered again.
Now we're starting a new fashion: we started to start digitalizing biology and now to go from that code from that code and synthetizing and synthesizing and synthesizing lives.
We always tried to bring a big questions.
"What is life life is something that many biological biological biological biological being?
We tried different approach, reduce it to the minimes in the minimes of the terms.
We're digitalizing almost 20 years hour.
When we sequenced the human genome was to go from the analogical world, the digital world,
Now we ask them, we can regenerate the life, or create new life from this universe --
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genome that is the smallest species from the smallest genome of those who can autoreplicate in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more smaller.
We're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the about 500 of the about 500 that are here.
But when we look at an an metabolic map on his map on the now.
And redeed, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimind, one at the time, it's very imlikely this can bring to a live.
So we decided that the only way to progress to progress this chromosomes in a way to be able to modify components to bring some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the wind of the "Posze "Can we synthetizing a cromother?"
It can make the chemistry that we have never been able to make these big molecules that we never have to create before?
And, in case of real-mother?
A cromosome, it's just a piece of material material of inerts.
The speed with which we are able to degitalize the life is growing exponential rhythm is going to exponential speed.
Our capacity of writing the genetic code of genetic code -- rather slowly, but it's improvempting there.
And our most recently results the results the exponential curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has request to a lot of past, began with a biothic review of the first experiments.
But we found that synthesizing DNA is very difficult.
There are thousands of thousands of cars in the world that produce little segments of DNA, the long equality of 30 to 50 to 50 letty and is a degenerative process is longer and a lot of degenerative and it's a long degenerative process is longer ger than 30 to the review of thousands of middle of middd
So we have to develop a new metodd a new metodd these fragments and correct the midddle and correct the midddle to go back to it.
And this was our first attempt to particular information of Phi 174.
It's a little viruses that kills bacteria.
We designed the fragments, effect the correction of the errors and get a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 literal DNA of about 5,000 literal literal rection of a DNA molecule of about 5,000 literror of a DNA molecule of DNA molecule of a molecule of DNA molecu
And the interesting part is when we took this piece of material material chemistry and we put it in the bacteria started to reading this genetic code and produce the virtual particle and produce the virtual particle viral particle of virtual material particles virtual particle of virtual material.
The virals are then released by cells, they are back back and have been back and destruct the Elen.
I talked about recently with members of oil industry was saying that they have certainly understanding this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things in largest things in large.
We wanted to build the whole chromosome.
They're more than 580 milddle code of genetic code.
So we have thought of building it in the size of virus, so that we could change the cassets to understand what the components are a living cell.
The design design is crucial information is crucial information in a computer, these are must be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate to it.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the accuratezation was a standard for every 10 mibasic miles.
We found it, resequence, 30 error. If we used that sequence, we had never been able to be able to do it work.
A part of the process is designing to design segments that are going to be able to make it up with all other segments of 50 feet to build underneath to build underneath tiny working together.
We try to be a unique elements here.
You probably read that we read the boat.
Think about that. We have a genetic code genetic on four liter: A, C, and T.
Three of those lettes together codified about 20 minoacid about 20 minoacid of letting for every minamminoacid of letting for every minamminoacid of the basic lettes.
So we can use the genetic code for words, frarain, thought.
What we did in the beginning was automobile beginning to do it.
Some have been deluses from the fact that it wasn't poeke.
We have designed these segments for a powerful simply with the entire segment.
There are gas. There are gasymes that repair them and put them assymes.
And we started to assembling the particular segments from five to seven a segmental letter to set 24 miles a lecture of 24 milddle lects, and it turns to 72 miles to get to 72 miles to 72 miles on the literally coming to 72 miles away from five to set a letter to se
At every steps we produced these segments in abundance so that we are going to make a very religiving procedition that we're going to make a minute.
We're trying to automatizing the process.
So, this looks like a table, it seems to a basic played by a basic played by a basic plays.
When we are going to take these segments, more than 100 mibasic segments, they will not grow more directly in Earth.
You get to the limited tools of the modern tool.
So we have considered other mechanism.
We knew about another mechanism called a recombination called "recombination of a biology to repaid the DNA to repair the seaters.
Here is a example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiodurans, can assassassassassassasses three million radiation.
You can see in the soil, as his cromosome, as his chromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was a primate.
They are thousands of organisms that are able to do this.
These organisms can be completely sat completely away.
They can live underneath it.
I'm absolutely sure that life exists in space and you move to find new environments to find new environments of water.
In the NASA showed that this aven.
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these process, just using the livivisience with the design appropriate designed by inserious segments from inserious segments.
The livivisual assembly them automatically
This picture was not taken with a electronic microscope with a bicroscope of rule.
It's a molecule so that we can see it with a microscope with a law.
These are that they covered a time of about six seconds.
This is the published that we did a little time ago.
They're more than 580,000 genetic code of genetic code of genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever created by the man.
It has a fish molecular on a 300 million hons.
If we walked up with a 10 carattack without space, they would want to 142 pages to just transck this genetic code this genetic code of this genetic code of genetic code of this genetic code on a type of a 10 paper for a code of a types to take this genetic code of a code of the genetic code this genetic
Now, how do we do it work?
Of course, you travel a virus.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use the bacteria.
It's even easier when it's also as a cell as our eucariot as our res: you simply it rotate the nucleum and insert a clon.
In the bacteria archaea the chromosome, is instead of the cell, but we recently recently we have shown that we are able to do a complete trapier trapile of a cell from one and active it from one and active it.
We can make a basic chromosome.
The two are different than the topies.
We added some genes in more in a way that we could decide what choose for this chromother.
And then it slight-up with the gases in a way to kill all the protects.
And when we put it in the cells was stuff -- and appreciate our softwo-stick softwo-to-cromosome is going to go into the cell.
And we started thinking we could not go beyond it, but we have a lot of common.
This is one of the most extremely mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a second species have added a second or a third or a third or a few hundreds of new tracks in a second thousands of new tracks at that species.
So who think about evolution as just as a gene to the evolution as a gene of the biology.
They have the gerisms called the restrial of restrion is that degerish the DNA.
The chromosomes that was in the cell as a hand.
The cellphone; the cromosomes that we insert it --
It's expressive, and he recognized the other hand, as a cromosome, has mastic, and we found it with only the cells and the new crumodel.
it became a blue because of the genes that we have insert.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a species are lost of the new species of a new species, the new species, the new species, the software that we insert in the cell.
All the protein have changed, the membranes are changed, and when we read the genetic code genetic stuff that we have transfer to what we have transfer to you.
Now, this could seem genetic alchemy but altering the software DNA we can change the things in enough.
Now, I have already explained that you don't talk about genesis -- but to try to go from three million years and a half evolution, and I told that maybe we're to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of new kind of digital process of digital process of digital process of digital process of digital process of digital process of the digital process of the di
Why do I do that?
I think it's enough obvious when we think about our necessarily to our necessity.
We're going to go from six billion and a half a billion people at nine billion in the next 40 years.
I'm going to give a example -- I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946, in 1946, there will be four years, it will be four year.
We're going to have problems now to find food, and clean fresh and clean and clean and banks for six billion people.
It will be even harder for nine billion us.
We can actually be more than five billion carbon of olide billion bars.
That means a half hundred million barrines a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to replace it to replace it will be a huge challenge of a huge challenge of processes to be a huge challenge of processes to replace to be a biological challenge of a processes to repirate of biological processes to repirate with biological processet of a processes to repiece of processes to be
In more we have to keep the whole emission of CO2 from these materials that finishes in the atmosphere.
Al day of today, thanks to the scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I think that are the designed component designed for the future.
The electronics only a dozen dozen of a dozen size of components, and think about how many different things have come out of them.
Our lights here are data principlely by the reality and our imagination.
Now we have the techniques, thanks to these metods of synthesization, in able to create what we call combinatoria.
We're able to build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes a million hand.
Think about the 20 million different genes or trial genes or try to get the processes to make the processes to make a little bundrugs, new vaccines, we can change a little team, and create biology team, and creating biology biology in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard selection of standard.
We can choose to choose in survival, production or chemistry or carbon or carbon of vaccines of vaccines.
This is a few software a few software programmed on which we're working for seeing and designing species and designing species to be able to set and designing species to computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they will be not.
We know exactly what their genetic code in their genetic code.
Now we're concentrate on the reality of nearly generation.
You saw you can see the ethanol from grand ethanol from grand was a finish.
We have a second realm and third generation that will be using enough pretty dallage as a buttent or of the highest value as the eight of butanol or different kinds of butanol.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without major major the food of food and limiting the disadddition would be transform CO2 in materials that we're working for cells that we are working for cells that can reach this discovery, and we could reach this discovery,
The solar light to be combined with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries in the world, we found different metodis.
This is a organism we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean deep in about 200 feet of the depth of the water.
It remakes from CO2 using using hydrogen using the energy source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can make CO2, which can easily be transported by tramite tramount of your birds, to make that CO2 in the urban -- to drive this process.
So I'm going to be able to increase what we could be able to increase what the basic questions is "No," trution -- we have the real objective modest otive otime-by-to-otime-re-up interest industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do that?
It would become a main of energy.
And also, we're working for using the same metods to create vaccines.
You saw this year with the influence, we're always background a year and a dollar, and a dollar, when it is to find the right vaccine just.
I think that what you can change build vaccines in ancient vaccinable in ancient anticipath that you can change build vaccines in ancient vaccines in ancient vaccines in ancient vaccines in ancient vaccines in ancient ant.
That's how the future could start to change it, it seemems to change it, now, the tree of evolution, accelerating the evolution, archeuos, and infinally indeed,
We're at so much from the best people.
Our purpose is to make enough to try to make it a long way to try to do it. Thank you very much.
Before I will see the most rapidly possible, some work work that we have been able to Microsoft in the new technology that we have bring to Microsoft in a year ago in a year ago in a year ago --
This is a environment that you can interact is a local level, which remote with an enormous amount of visual data from visual data --
So we're seeing a lot of gabyte of photo-constantly digital gables and continue, for a speed of the hurt images as we want to do the images as we want to do it.
And it doesn't matter how big amount of information that we see it, as a lot of these data or images.
Most are digital photographs, but this for example is a provision from Bilibrary from the Bilibrary of Congress and reach in the 300 megame.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limited the only thing that the path is the number of place on your screen. It's also an architecture in any time. It's also an architecture that is very flexible.
This is a book inter, example of data not images.
This is the Dickens. Ogni desolath of Dickens. Ogni is a capital represents a capitly.
To show you that it is just about head, and not images, we can do something like this, to make a very representation of a representation of the textbook, not a photo.
It could be a little bit of a little artificial book a book electronic book a little bit of a book a little bit of a book for a little bit of a book electronic book for a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of artificial book for a little bit of artificial book to read a little artifici
You don't think it goes to it.
This is a more realistic. It's a number of the Guardian.
Every picture is the beginning of a section.
And it will really give you really the pleasure and beauty experience to read the version of a view or a quotional team, which is nature or a lot of half a a lot of half a a half a lot of half a a lot of half a a lot of half a a lot of midddle or of a hal
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of the Guardianan.
We created a high advertising high resolutions, much more than what it is using in a normal published in a normal audience.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific specific specific things.
And this really demonstrate some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen.
We hope that this means to put pop up and other clean and other similar to be necessary.
Of course, map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have contributes to be that we have contributes to do in this field.
These are all the way in the U.S. objects over a picture of NASAAA.
So we're going to go to something else.
This is actually actually from the websk; you can go to the websk; you can go to see it.
This is a project called Photosynth, which is a two different technologes.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research of interesting in Noah Snavely, a student, a student of the Washington, with the aid of Seliski Seliski Seviski Rick Szeliski Research. Selish Seadragony collaboration.
And it's from the web, I gestrun, gestures.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen -- where we can go from a picture of the other and have this kind of experience to the other hand.
But the space collocaon the images here has actually an meaningful meaning.
The realgorithms of visualization in the computer have recorded these pictures together, so that you can realize the real places that imagine -- all the near Grashes on the Montags -- you have been attempt to the Roccipe of a slide-show of a slidestable slidestable.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There's some more space than space in the space of space
I want to go directly to one of the original data from Noah-- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynthy that we have done to work for the first time you have done to show you what I think about it is really really really really clear, technology, technology, technology, technology, technology, technology, technology that we have been looking at the environmental environmental that we put in the side that we put in the synthy in the web.
We have to worry about legal and I saw up and say, I live to saying.
This is a rebuilding in Notare a rebuilding in Notare Dam, you know, Flickr. Basta digitary in Flickr. And you get images of the major images of the major or images of these constants and I saw up with a picture that is discovered appears to this models that is disappears to this model.
So I have all picked up to Flickr and have been all colleged in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never have been thinking about to Microsoft.
It's very gratificial accovering this kind of accovering here.
I think you can see that it is a lot of different kinds of different kinds of photos of those photos in those photos in the SLR, a SLR, a tremendous number of different environment.
And if you can try to do those strange more strange.
A lot of they are hundred down, etc.
It's a series of photographs -- it's a series -- etch -- etcol.
This is a Notare Damames of Notare recorted.
We can go from the places to the view of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment. This is taking from the entire performance of how it appears -- and it turns out of view -- and it all those data together.
All of those pictures become college together, more than the species.
You have a model of the earth that we emerge.
Think about this as a long proputting the Stephen Lawler on Earth
It's something that grows in complexity as people use.
Their picture is bring with metaphors of other people.
If you get to convert all these kinds of sants saying the nome, my picture of Notare of Notare suddenly Damdry, and I can use all of those data, and I can use all of those data, and I can use how point point in the space of the universe -- in that universe, in that universe, using the half of the hands of the space and a cross-smooth experience of the kind of recty and mocross-s-s-smodelight and cross-ss and and cross the cross of the experience of the sant,
And of course, a consequence of all this is extremely elaborated virtual consequence of the earth, and as a view of airplane and images and similar images, but by the memory of collective -- but by the memory of collective virtual consue.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood well? What is going to do is that the software going to connect us to do is that in the next years, all photographs -- all the photographs who are basically connected to anybody in the world will be practically college together?
BA: Yeah. What is doing in practice practice is discovered.
He's creating hyperline, if you want to stand between images.
And it's doing it in the base of the images.
And it becomes very interesting if you think about the reck of information that many of these images can have come very interesting images that are seems to be very interesting of these images can have to be very interesting of these images.
As when you make a research of images on the web, you tell a sentence and the pages on the web is about the pictures of the pictures of the pictures.
Now, what happens if that picture is a picture of all your photos do you get to the picture?
So the amount of interconnection, and the amount of reck and the amount of reck that is really enormous effect of the network.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BA: I thank you very much.
One of the principal pleasures and one of the ethnographics is the power to live between who has no antial to the antial pasts of the antial pastern in the wind-do-like travels in the windrinks.
Basti thinking that sciamans Jaguar journey -- the Mily Waay, or the myths are still in Himalaya, or that in Himalaya, or the respire respire of the respire of the respire of the anthropologia, to remember the world that the central reality, and the idea that we live view of the anthropologia, and the world that is just a model of reality, but it's just a model of reality,
the consequence of a particular choices that our stirps that our stirps of a lot of generations ago.
And, of course, we all share the essential tracks.
We all produce it.
We're subjects, you know, it began to be a lot of beginning.
We have to deal with the inexorability of deat, so it doesn't surprising us and balliam, and balliam,
We have a art of art.
What it is the particular is the particular song, the rrith of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Earth of the Borneo, or the followers, or the Haiti, or the Deeerriors of Kaisut in Kaise in the Kaise of Sahara.
He was my journey in desert a month ago, or a month ago, or a month in the game of Qomolangl, on the Everest, the mother of the world.
All these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of moving in the world.
And, if you reflect a moment that it can give you hope.
Asidgen cultures of cultures of the world create a ragnateflight and cultural is important for the planet and cultural is important for the bend of the planet as the ragnaily biosphere.
And you can think about this ragnatela cultural as a hetness as a fer and you can define the eth, dreams, dreams, dreams, and ideas, ideas -- and ideas and inspirations, intuitions -- and intuitions from the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness.
The ethnose is the amazing patrimoney of humanity
It's the symbe, of what we are and what we can be in as a species inquisisite than inquisist of what we can be in as a species.
And because the biosphere was gravely consumed as a lot of other as happened to the ethnose.
No biology, for example, it would say 50 percent of all the species was or on the extinction of the extinction of the summatter -- in the most apocality, or -- in the most apocality, or -- and not near the near hypothesis -- that the most optimistic diversity -- that is the most of the cultural diversity -- that the cultural diversity -- that is the most of the cultural diversity -- that is about about about the hours of the history --
The indicates of all of this is, of course, the language.
When you're born there were 6,000 language on this planet.
A language is not just by a vocabulary or from a series of rules.
A language is the sprarazy of human spirit human spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit language.
It's the meeting of every culture is a half with the material in the material.
English is a forest of mind, a wind, a thinking, a thinking, a though ecosystem of spiritual system of spiritual system of spiritual system of mind, a spiritual system of mind, a spiritual system of the mind, a spiritual system of spiritual spiritual system of spiritual possibility of spiritual possibility of spiritual possibility system.
And those 6,000 language, as we are here sitting here in Monterey, at least half is not suspect in the ears.
They don't come more teached teached to children, which is not walking something, which are already dead.
What is more tristes than being fly in the silence, of being the last talking about a language of being a language of trum or or anicipate or or or ananicipate the same of the children's promise of the daughter?
This is a fashion was the same one in some part of the world every two weeks a few weeks a well-well and bring with soul in the tombs of a anguguy in the tombs of a anguy.
And I know that somebody is going to tell "I’re not better than that?
The world would not be a better place, if we all parlassic place?" Benisish synisuba. We all love yoruba.
We talk about kogs.
Scover a network thing means you can't talk about their language.
And I would like to do you a journey through the etner --
a little journey in the eagnosing ethnose of what we're loging.
Many of us forget when I say, "different ways I say, "different ways of exister" inting really different ways of exists.
We take for example this bimbo Barasan Amazonia in the sector, the popular of anaconda, which creates the milk of the ridrive of the milk of the milk of the milk of the best of the sacric sacridge.
It's a popular that it doesn't have to distinguid the blue color, because the time celestes is identified in the forest of the forest is identify in the forest of the popular popular popular as the popular popular of the popular popular of the forest that is identified the blue of the green popular of that is identified the blue of the green in the forest of the popular popular power of the popull of the popular
They have a strange language and a mathematrimonial regular language, "English is a different language that a different person that talks about a different language.
And it all has radicated in the mythological past, all the specifically is that in these families are about seven or seven language because of the seven languages in a language.
They listening to listening and then they start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I live visite, the Waoranancer, the Waorancer, a popular population that has had the first contact in 1958.
In 1957 mission missionaries have tented a committed contact of a fact that we have a facal midddle of 195.
They did the ground from the photographs that they were retled that they were retents that this popular popular popular forest that this popular popular of the plum had never seen anything about birth of bi-dimensional forest of birth of the size of birth of the photographs that were going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to love from the size.
They collected the ground, they have been research a form or a form or a shape or a shape and they kill it in the diavoid and killed kids with the five missionaries with the five mixsionaries with the five miles.
But Waorananese Waorans don't kill the strangers.
They kill them in a them.
54 percent of mortality was because of their death was because of their stocking.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope I hope to reach other college and proverse to some college college in the case doesn't notaste.
I want to start with what I call the officale."
The offical officer of thing?
The officer officer of all society of the Western industrial societies -- "If we want to massimizate the well-being of our citizen "The way to be to be a freedom to be detect the libert."
The reason why it is a late, in fact that the freedom is in the fact that the liberty is preciout, essential for human beings.
On the other is that if we are free, if we are liber, we can act to do everything that we can act our beneath to us to do everything that decide in name.
The way to massimizing liberty is to male the choice.
More people choice people hannonow, more liber, and most is liberty, more than their freedom, it's their well.
These that, it's so deeply is so deeply in society that no one would be subsubsubject in the two-hand-a-a-hold society that no one would be a deeply in society that no one would be a deeply to put it into society that no one would be subsubsubject in the society that would be a deeply in the society that would be a deeply to put it into the two-hold society would be a dream.
And it's also deeply in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has react possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big things.
I allowed a simple named on a half condition.
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions, without contart 10 varietes of oil and 12 acets and 12 acets that you can buy to be a huge number of minds that you can buy a huge number of conditional conditional and 15 already already already is to your own or 15 already already to be able to do it.
This is the supermarket.
And then you go to the snegotio of electronic to buy a stere: CD, setor sket, printing --
And in this single negotial of electronic components is a big number of components.
We can make six million and a half million different combinations that there are in a negotid.
You need to admit that there's a lot of choice.
Other than the world communications.
One time, when I was a child, you could get all the services that they could get all the services that were going to be provide from mamma Bell.
He read the phone -- you didn't buy the phone --
A consequence of this, in the other one was that the phone doesn't rops it up.
These are the temples are gone.
Now we have a variety of phones almost of phones -- especially between cells.
Here is the cells of the future.
My favorite is the midddle of MP3, cut the hidden and force in the horse of the bule.
If you have no yet, you have seen in the house negotic negotids, you know,
And what happens is that people entering in the negozes and do this question. And do you know what the answ? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cellular that doesn't make things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water is the same explosion of choices.
Assistance healtharia: not happens in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor of what you need to do.
And then you go to the doctor, and the doctor says, "Okay, we could do A, or B" -- "As it has these wells and these answer "B" has these wells and these answer and these risks.
You say, "Dr, what would I do?
And the doctor says, "As these wells and these answer and these answer."
"What do you want to do?"
And you can rebate if she was to me, "What's going to do you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not lei."
The result we call it the autonomy of the malato," expression that it seems a beautiful thing.
But actually it doesn't know that one of the weight and responsibility of the understanding decisions somebody who knows whatever it knows anything that you don't know -- and almost certainly -- and so in the ideal conditional decisions to take the ideal decisions to make the patient decisions to make the patient decisions to make the patient decisions to take the patient of the decisions that you can do the decision.
There's a marketing marketing products, you would say people like me and you, if you think about people like me and you, if you think he's not a sense that we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy it it, why do you publisher?
The answer is that they want to do the doctor to ask them to change the recipe of changing the recipe of changing the recipe of changing the recipe of the morning is that they want to change the doctor for the morning to change the recipe of the recipe of the morning to change the recipe of the morning is that they want to change the recipe the recipe of changing the morning of the morning
And so a fundamental thing like this is our identity is a choice, as you see in this view in this view of the children. We will not want to force their sex moment or right nonow. They'll not want to be an identity to invent.
And we can reinvented us how many times we agree to reinvent.
The that means that every morning to the answer -- you have to decide that kind of person wants to be there.
And I respect to the family and matrimoney, a time perspective, I was such as possible, and I was going to get the most as possible, and you start getting the most pretty possible, and you start the most pretty possible,
The only real choice was with choice was with choice, and nemess what to do later.
Ogame, it's really played.
I mean, I think, very intelligent students, and I do the 20 percent less of a time.
And because they are not less brilliant because they are less diligent.
but why I'm impensierits, I mean I mean I said, "I should be able or no? I should do it now?"
"I should be more tardi? I have to think before the children or career?"
They're interrogatives of logorant interrogatives
And they try to answer these questions, even if this imply not completely to completely realize a vote to my example.
And they really have to do that. They're really important.
Now, the work: we're lucky, as Carl l World World technology -- because technology technology allows us to work every day, from Hotel Randolph.
Two parents is a corn, and I'm not going to tell anybody where Wii Fi works.
I don't say that, because I want to use it.
What does this meanmeaningful liberty that we have to work or not. What is that we have to decide that we have to decide, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our phynest physical phone in a tasca, Blackberry in the other, and the needs the needs -- typically on the beginning.
And even though they all have to be all in the minute that we see our child relief the head, we're also asking this called ""I have to answer this called aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah?"
"I have to answer this email? I have to able?
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes experience the experience of your child very different from what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of that we look at it, little things and big things and big objects, and life, life is a choices and life.
Once the world was this once -- there were some possibilities, but it was not a choice.
The world today is this is like this: "Islemma is -- "Is it a positive thing or negative negative now?"
The answer is Shim.
The positive side of the negative side them all over the negatives --
All this choice is two negative effects.
The first one, paradoxy, is that produces are that produces instead of free instead of freezing free.
And so many options that you choose the way to be very hard to do it.
I want to give you an example meaning: a study on the plans of the volunteers.
A college had access to the data of the Vancer, the giant of thought, with about a million pounds of thought, with about a million hundred companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are going to offeres more than 10 solutions that are offeres more than 2.
With 50 sources is 10 percent less than 10 percent less of adesionate when they have been available to only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources which choose is detail, it's detailly hard to decide and choice is remained to indequestions.
And to ask questions, questions, questions, questions, questions, and of course, won't stop.
You know that it doesn't only mean that these workers will eat food and they will eat food because they don't have enough money, to say that the decision is so ostic that decision is so ostic that they lost the funds of the data of the works.
Don't participand, they're losing to 50,000 dollars a year from the work, which would be well saying to true.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally, for the ethis: ketchup, or major major major maione?"
You would just take the right decision if it's for the right decision if it's for ethis?
You don't want to choose the wrong and neps the wrong condition.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we could avoid the paralysis and make a choice, we are less about how we would have been less with less options of how we would have been going to be choice.
And this for different reasons.
One of those is that with a lot of conditional conditions, if you buy a different choice, and it is not perfect as a different choice, and that you could do a different choice. And what happens is that alternative imagined it indeed, and the resilips of the choice, and the religium of choice, and the relieffort of the choice, and the recovered the reliable decision of the record of the choice,
even when a very good decision.
More choices that are easy easy than any details of any details that insoddsatic option.
Inother, there's what economic economists called opportunity --
Dan Gilbert asked very well stamacine as the value things that we depends on what we confrontive to the things we confrontive it.
And the means when there are many options that we can represent the represents of the alternative alternative and be less soddddisored in fact of the option that you have choice.
Here's an example. I suspect with all those who are not New York.
But it's what you probably think you probably think.
There's this coum to Hamptons.
A place of lusel.
It is travels to splendida. It's all about them.
Nothing eat. But what he thinks is, "Well, what he thinks is Augosto."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are vie."
"I could talk about the front of the front of house."
And it turns out two weeks from the idea that it's allowing -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants to be going to do.
The cost-opportunity diminum the soddisfation for what we have, even when the choice was excell.
And more the opportunity we have to consider the more characteristics will come back to the way against as expensive as expensive opportunity.
Here is another example.
This view a lot of things.
It speak about live moment and maybe live live livivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivive of the live livivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivi
But the most important point is that any choice, you choose it down.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of four that can make less atten.
Third point: growing spiral growing expectative.
I tried on my skin my skin a couple of jeans.
I was almost always jeans.
One time the jeans were just a type and they were bought to best, they were dissimiles, only after they had to be comfortable to be well.
So, I went to buy a new new jeans when the old ones were going to buy when the old ones were going to bought a couple of jeans, this is my cute."
The compared me said, "You want to stop me -- easy -- relaxed fit?"
Would you want to be able or with the bottons? "Stonebbuttons?
"You want to room them in the room?"
"Soth eight or stretch, or stretch, you know, it was -- "Continupon to elense?
I was sleorder, and after a little bit I could say, "I want to do the kind of -- which was the only guy -- that was the only one guy -- I was so so I tried all of the jeans, then I tried all of the jeans, then I got the best jeans, and the best jeans that I never had to hold jeans that I never had to hold up it.
It was the mye. With everybody had a bad I got the best best.
But I felt worse I was worse to me.
Why? I wrote a book about it.
The reason I was worse I was worse is that with all the choice were altish altish were altish altish to be perfects.
And I started a minimum I was expectations of exceptional when you have a type of 100 different in in the type of 100 different guys had to be perfect.
What I had water was good -- but not perfect it.
After the reality to the choice with what I was insodded in confront of what I was insodded in expectative.
The addition in life of the people don't forward people do not increasing the expectations that these are respective of the stitution.
And this will produce less soddisftion, even when the results are good ones.
No one in the marketing world of marketing it down.
Because if you know what I'm talking about, you know, I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
"You were better when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse to meet of the surprises.
Ogame, in the world that we live -- opulent, industrialized by expectancy -- the massive that we can hope is that things are the things that are the things that are things like to the height of the expectancy.
You never have ever surprised pleasant to be expectancy, my expectancy are ingigant.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is "Baspect."
I mean -- little authobiographic moment -- which is really unbelieved and my wife is really wonder.
I could not have been able to do better, I don't have to be contented.
But I can tell you it's not always a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of the jeans comfortable jeans when there's only that jeans is that when you don't have satic soddddden you, "Why you know, "Why is it?"
Who is responsible responsible is clear?
The world is responsible responsible to us?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a hundreds of jeans, and you ask who is responsible to the responsible you who is responsible for yourself as you are.
You could have a better.
With hundreds of variety hundreds of successful variety of success.
So when people take decisions, even if the result is valize, you feel feel insods, and they feel the satic to their states.
In the last years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think a meaning that a meaning -- not the unique -- not the unique, but important -- this depression is that people have experiences deludent den deludent because standards, standard is too alties.
And when they explain this situation thinking that the colp is they think that the colp is there.
So the final result is that in general is that in general -- but we feel things --
Let me tell you about it.
This is the offical dog, what we all take for good and it's completely false. It's not true. It's not true.
There's no two-that a little bit of choice is better than I haven't have a lot of choices that you don't have a lot of choice is better than a little bit of a little bit better than a little bit better than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit better than a little bit of a choice.
There's a critic, magic value of it. I don't know what it is.
But I'm enough enough we have been super-central enough that we have a piece of the live.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost -- I have almost -- from the point of view is the follow.
What it allows all this choice in the industrial society is the material.
There are many places in the world, and you know that they have no park about it, which the problem is that they have no choice.
The problem is that they have too pocket.
So the fact that I'm talking about is a malesclusive being a diesclusive of modern, recidental society.
And what it does depress and arrabbing is this: Steve Levitt talked about iers and seatch as a little bit of money, and seats are involved to money. It's a spreare inus.
I mean that these choices, complicated and dispending, it's not that they just are involved us.
They're delliteral dely.
They make it worse worse --
If a little bit of what in our society allows allows was reversed in those where people have too poor people have too poundition to be improve but also the now.
This is what economists call a better paretian paretian paretian paretian.
A redistribution, it's not just to everybody -- not just to poor -- not just the poor -- because of this choice that you go back to us.
And so he said, "Well, you can become everything you can become everything that you want to be --
You know, people are culture, you think, "What do you believe that fish the fish face that fish cept that fish ack?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a vetrocket."
"As a him, a light vision of the world."
