Part years ago, here at TED, Peter Skillman introduced a challenge of design called the marshmallow.
And the idea is very simple.
The four people have to build the most people have to build the highest possible that you can reduce it alone, using 20 spaghang meter of aways, one meter of the aunt meter and a marshy meter.
The marshmallow needs to be stuck in the top.
And even though it looks very simple, because it's pretty difficult because they costring people to collaborate very quickly.
And so I thought it was an interesting idea and I incorporated it in a laboratory about the projection.
And it was a huge success.
And since then I organized about 70 labs of designing this kind of around the world with students, designers and architects, designers and architects, designers and architects, even the development of the companies of Fortune 50.
There is something in this exercise that reveals reveals on the nature of collaboration, and I would like some of these lessons.
Normaly, most people start with the orienting to orienting towards the compit.
They talk about, you know, you imagine what it might expect, they spend the power, then they spend the planning time planning planning --
They make slavery and pray the prices.
They run the most of the time to deal with the most of time to be assembling the spaghetti in structures and the end, just when the time is to go to the marshmallow, and they falls it up in the top, they take a step back and Tah!
They address.
But what happens is actually the most of the times, is that the "Ta-day." It turns into a Uh," because the marshshmallow makes the marshmallow makes the whole structure.
There is a number of people who have many more moments of the h-oh-oh moment, and the worst there are neolaureated business schools.
Mentono, cheat, you distragge, and they create absolutely transballs transbant structured.
And there are naturally groups that have much more structures "ta-day" -- and, in the miles, there are the neodiployees of childhood.
And it's incredible.
As Peter says Peter, not just create higher structures are the most interesting structures.
And your question will be possible? What's possible? What do they have particular?
And Peter love to say, "No one of the kids spent time trying to become the Spage of Spage Spage A."
They don't spend time competing for the power.
But there is another reason.
And the reason is that the economy students are formed to find the single best project.
And then I get it.
And after that, what happens is that when they put the marshmallow in the top, they have no longer, and what happened?
crisis.
It sounds familiar? Right.
What the children are doing differently, is that they start from the marshmallow, and they build prototypes, one after the other, tening the several marshmallow, they have several possibilities to address along the way,
The designer reconstruction that this kind of collaboration is the essence of the Iterative process.
And with any version, the children have a faithist on what works.
So the ability to work on prototypes, but we see how they work different groups.
The average for most people are about 50 centers, for the economic students for economics, about the met, and a little bit better, but not much children, better than many adults.
Who does better than everything?
Architd and engineers, thank you to the sky.
9/nine is the highest structure that I've ever seen.
And why? Because they understand that triangles and the geometric models are the key to build structure.
Then we have the general directors, a little better than the average.
But here's where it becomes interesting.
If you include an administrated, the group can make a lot better.
It's amazing. You go on the yard, you know, you look like that bunch of wind." You can understand it. And why? And why? And why? And why?
Because they have particularly more in accomplishing the altrure.
They get the process, I understand it.
And all the groups that are managing and pay attention to work improving the result of the theam.
Two special and acagulation, and their combination bringing a safe success.
If you have 10 groups that are usually working well, you will perhaps six that will have structures that are going to have structures that are in feet.
And I tried an interesting experiment.
I thought, let's get the mail.
I put 10,000 dollars on the planet,
What do you think happened to design?
What was the result?
This is what happened.
None of the team has created a stable structure.
If one of them made a framework from 2.5 cm, it would brought back home the premium.
Isn't it interesting is that an impact so strict?
We tried to come up with the same students.
What do you think this happened?
Now they got the value of a prototype.
The same team, from the worst has become the best one.
They created the highest structure in the minor time.
So they're important lessons on the nature of incentives and the success could you ask the time a marshmallow time to write a marshmallow?
The reason is this: help create digital tools and make digital tools to help groups build cars, video games and visual effective.
And what a marshmallow is to help to identify the nose assumption of the hidden assumption.
Because, honestly, every project has his marshmallow, isn't that that?
The challenge is a shared language, a common language, a common to build a prototype.
And so, this is the value of the experience, of this simple exercise.
And those of you who were interested in, it can go to marshmallower challenge.com.
It's a blog where you can take a look at how to build marshmallows.
There are past educations.
There are crazy examples from all over the world on how people correct and upside the system.
There's also the world record of the world.
And the most importantly, I think, is that design is that design is really a sport.
It requires the footage of all of the sense, and the useful of reasons, the feeling and manuality to run the challenge that has in hand.
And sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all that is necessary to transform a huh-to-day."
And that can actually make a difference.
Thank you very much.
We end up up here to have a car, great machine, beautiful style in TED, is a time machine.
Everyone in this room have to get it.
You can go back, you can go a; you can't stay where you are.
And I would be curious to know what you would choose because I asked him my friends in the last time, and everybody wants to come back back.
I don't know. They want to come back before they were Twitter or Twitter or "Idol."
I don't know.
I'm convinced that there is a sort of return to our algia, to the likeep.
I understand it.
But I'm not part of that group, I have to admit it.
I don't want to go back and not because I'm going to come back and why I am not going back and go back.
So I want to go into the car and I want to go on.
This is the best time that there was on this planet in every field that we can measure, wealth, mobility, mobility, mobility, hot of disease.
There has never been a period like this.
My great-grandparent bissnake big, everybody's 60 years.
My grandparents spent that number of 70.
My parents are to touch the 80.
So it's better than there is a nine at the beginning of my death.
But it's not only about people like us, is a much bigger than that.
A child in New Delhi today can be expected to live as much as the richest man in the world of 100 years ago.
Think about it. It's an incredible.
How does it be it?
smallpox. The smallpox. The smallpox.
He changed the demography of the global war has never done.
If you were born gone.
We have swood.
In the rich world threatening millions of people only one generation does not exist in practice.
Difterite, rusoly, polyy; polymer,
someone still knows what they are it?
Finally, modern medicine, our ability to feeding billions of people, these are triump-scientific method.
And the second me, the scientific method, to try things -- see if they work -- change, it's one of the great results of humanity.
These were the good news.
Unfortunately, they were the uniques because there are other problems, and they were quoted a lot of times one of them is that, although everything we've goted, one billion people on the planet, every day.
This number is growing, with incredible rapidly, and it's very quickly true.
And not only we used our creativity to refer the planet.
Wather pockets, farming rainforests and rainforests, oil, gason: they are disappeared, and they are disappeared, and if we don't innoat our actions to pull out from this guy, we will be out of this guy, we also disappeared to us.
So the question is: can we do it? I believe yes.
I think it's clear that you can make food for feeding billions of people without violent the earth that they living.
I think it's possible to revive this world of energy without that this destroy.
I really think about it, and it's not an illusion.
But here's the thing that holds me in the night -- one of the things that they hold the night,
We've never had so need scientific progress as we need right now, but we need now, and we have never been in the position of how we might today.
We are at an incredible event -- really, in many ambites.
But although I think we should go to side, 300 years, before the Illuminism, 300 years, before the Illuminism that we fought the progression that we have to fight the larger and more fronts, than we do.
People are around, and they do it with a lot of the force that we can't free them.
It can be able to free it.
Listen, everyone have right; they have right; they also have the right right to progression of progress, but you know what you don't right?
You've got no right to your facts. I said, you know, you can't do it.
I put a little bit to understand it.
A decade years ago, I wrote a story about vaccines for "The New Yorker," a short article.
And I was stupid that somebody was opponent to what it is, after all, the most effective public health of all human history than the whole human history of human history.
I didn't know what to do, so I did as usually -- I wrote the story and I went to the way.
Not much later, I wrote a story about genetically modified.
Same thing, just bigger.
People were crazy.
So I wrote a story about that, and I couldn't understand why people were to be able to understand why people were to be mostroke, because they thought they move the molecules in specific ways, instead of case, instead of case, rather than at the work of nature.
But, as I do my work. I wrote the story and I went on.
I mean, I'm a journalist, we wrote a cend, let's go and go and cended up there.
But these stories were tortured and I couldn't understand why, but I did.
The problem was that those fanatics that they were doing crazy not fanatic.
They were consciousness, educates, people for good.
They were exactly how people in this room.
And the thing that was going to get a lot of --
But then I thought, ways, we have to be honest. We have to be honest. We have the same relationship with progress that there was one time.
We talk about the environment.
We talk about ironic terms, using the virgolds: "Progress" V, well, there are reasons to do it, and I think we know what they are.
We have lost confidence in the institutions, and sometimes in the science itself, and it is understood that it has happened.
You just have to do just some names and people understand it.
Cnobyl, Bmark, the Challenger, Viox, I have a massive destruction of mass destroying,
I mean, each one has his list.
We have questions and problems with the people that thought were always right.
So you sit skeptics.
Wake question, pretend answers, pretend to try it.
Don't give anything to that.
But here is the fundamental point: when the evidence to accept it, and we're not very good at this.
And I think that the reason is that we find in a fear epidemic of that I had never seen and hope I don't share it.
About 12 years ago was published a story, a story, a story, a story between an epidemic of autism autism and vaccines against death, parotite vaccines.
Very frightening.
Centers of studies were made to see if it was true.
And they had to do hundreds of studies; it's a important.
And they came up with the data.
They came from the United States, from England, from the Canada, from the Canada, and all of them were equal, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation of nothing.
He didn't make it difference. Not because we think about anecdos, to what we see -- -- -- what we think we can see, what we think about real feel.
We don't think of an documents from the government of the government that show us numbers show us numbers, and I understand it, I think we all understand it.
But you know what?
The results have been devastanted --
Now devastating because there is a fact. The United States are one of the few countries in the world where the number of vaccines against the death.
It's horrible, and we should be revergone of us ourselves.
It's terrible.
What happened to do something like you do to do something like that?
Now, I understand it.
Think of it, somebody here has the death?
Anyone in the audience has ever seen a death?
It doesn't happen.
In this country doesn't happen, but it was 160,000 times in the world last year
I'm a great deaths for a death, 20 hours.
But since it didn't success here, we can take it from my head, and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around and ignorance and ignorance from palcoscenes like Oprah Larry King Live.
And they can do it because they don't understand the difference between causality.
They don't understand that these two things seem to be huge, but I don't know.
But it's something that we need to learn, and we need to learn it fast.
This man was a hero, Jonas Salk.
It has liberated the humanity from one of his flower worst worst worst of his flowers.
No fear, no fear, no suffering; you can disappear.
The man at the center, not higher.
It's called Paul Offit.
He just created a vaccine against the rotabus together to other people.
He saved 400, 500 miles in the developing countries in the developing world.
However, right?
It's either, if it wasn't that Paul goes around to speak of vaccines, it says how praying and that people should just stop.
And he says it in these terms of these terms.
So Paul is considered a terrorist.
When Paul talks about an audience can't testimonce.
They call it to the house because they like to remember that they know where his children go to school.
Why? Because Paul has created a vaccine.
I wouldn't need to say that, but the vaccines are fundamental.
If we stick to take them, terrible disease, and it's going on.
We have a moral death.
And it's going to be worse and not much in a lot of the kids will be going to die again, because it's just a number of number.
And they're not going to die.
Can poly? Right. Why do we do that?
My colleagues of college was written a couple of weeks ago, and he said that I thought was a little bit of a little bit of excessive.
No one had said before.
She wouldn't vaccinated his son against the polyo.
No dead died.
OK.
Why? Why don't there is the poly."
Yesterday, we didn't have the polio in the United States.
Today I don't know -- perhaps it states a guy is salion an airplane in Lagos and is coming to Los Angeles, now is on the Ohio.
And maybe it's going to have a couple of hours will see a machine, will come here in Long Beach and stasage to one of these fantastic cene organized from TED.
He didn't know that I was infected by a paralyzing disease, and we don't know it because it's how the world.
This is the planet where we live with. We don't do it until it is.
We address circumstances. We love it.
Would you have all the livamin?
Echinacea, a little bit of antiossiants to start the day.
I know you did it because half of the Americans do it every day.
They take that stuff, as they affect the alternative medicine, and no matter how often we demonstrate that they are useless.
The data will always show it.
They have the highest urine. More of this don't do almost ever before.
But it's good, you want to spend 28 billion dollars per urbin school, are with you.
Urina school.
Why do we do that? Why?
I think I can figure out, okay.
We have the great government machine. We don't trust it.
And we do good. Our healthcare system.
It's cruel to millions of people.
It's absolutely, incredibly cold and death for those of us who can afford it.
So we get away and away from the people to refugee?
We're going to stand in the great placebo.
It's cool. We love the great placeb.
You know, it's a serious problem because this is a slavery, and we spend billions of dollars.
I have a whole series of examples here.
No one of these -- a from, echinacekeeps -- a frog -- I don't know what it is but we spend billions of dollars, and it's a from.
You know what? When I say these things, people are doing things that you can get on it, and they say, "What do you interesting?
It makes them way."
You guess a wher? You have a tor.
Because I'm not interested in if it's the secret of the Dipartment for the Salute and the Uhm, I don't want to hear the evidence of mammal's experts on mographa," or if the mographadi," or if it says, "Uhm, I don't want patient patients with clisters at the coffee climbers.
When we embock the street that leads to replace science and evidence with magic and tradition, we end up in a place where we wouldn't be.
Let's do it as Thabo Mbeki in South Africa.
He killed 400 miles of his conditionwise, you know, walk on the box, cklewing and the limon anti-retroviral drugs that we know can slow AIDS.
Centles of thousands of inutilize in a nation that has been brought more than any other from this disease.
Please don't come to tell me that there are no consequences for these actions.
There are seed: There are always there.
Now, the stupid epidemic that we are in the middle of the supplements of genetically modified foot and the elite of the genetically modified food elements.
It's an idiot. It has to end up.
It's a diatridge on the metaphor.
It's ideology, it's not science.
Every single thing that we eat, every chick, every leaves of price, every leaves of Bruxelles was modified by man.
You see, there were no handle in the garden.
There were no melance.
There were no news of Natal.
We did it over the last 11,000 years.
Something worked and something else is.
And we have eliminated what I didn't work.
Now we can do it more precisely around.
And there are some of the risk; it certainly.
But we can put things like vitamin A in the rise, and it would help millions of people, promoting their lives.
And we don't want to do it?
I have to tell you, I don't understand it.
We are contrary to the OGM.
Why?
The things that I feel always like chemicals, pesticides, pesticides, pesticides, we don't want to get farming far, is wrong.
We don't want the companies to put a short of life.
We don't want the companies are unique.
You know what my answer to this?
It's yeah. You've got right. Let's do something.
It's true, we have an enormous, but it's not science.
It has nothing to do with science.
It's light, morality, lines on the short of the shortvessels.
You know that science is not a corporation.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
It's a process, sometimes it gives sometimes positive results -- but the idea that we should not allow science to make his work because we have fear is actually very lab, and it's actually very lab, and it's getting millions of prosperous.
You know, in the next 50 years, we're going to produce 70 percent of food in more than we produce 70 percent of what we produce now, 70 percent.
These are investments in Africa of the last 30 years.
Vergoice.
They need and need us and we don't do it.
What? Ho's genetically modified.
We don't want to encourage people to eat slavery.
The billionth of people eat.
It looks like a little path.
But providing just calories.
It has no nutrient, it has no protection, but scientists are finding the way of unserircelles right now.
So many people could eat and run less the risk of becoming blind.
They won't they are famous, and you know what?
It would be very beautiful. It wouldn't be a restoring restoring but it would be very beautiful.
I just go on and ask myself, why are we count?
I mean, let's choop at this thing?
Just why don't we want to move the genes and there?
It's about to move genes. It's not about chemicals.
It's not about our obsession for the ormons, or our desire to have greater food, better food.
There is no Rice Krispies.
It's about rescue of people, and it would be now that we start to understand what it wants.
Why do you know? -- if we don't understand it? -- if we don't understand it, and we continue to beat how we're going to be honone, we're going to be clear with technological colonialism.
There is another way of describe what is going on.
It's egoist, it's horrible, it's in front of us, and we have to stop.
So, after this conversation conversation, you could ask myself, "You still want to go into this redistrong time and go to the future?
Yeah! Of course I want.
It's blocked on the present right now, but we have an incredible opportunity.
We can put the car in time as we want.
We have a chance to go where we want, and we will really do where we want.
We have to do these conversations, and we have to think, but when we go in the time and we go to be happy to do it.
I know that we can say, as much as I think that the world needs to be.
Thank you.
Thank you.
One day, the chronically, the Los Angeles Steve Lopez was past in the streets of Los Angeles when he felt a great music.
It was from a man, a man, an afro-American, fascinating, with the marcats, without dimore, that he played a violin that he had only two cors.

My name is Janyigal. I'm a video game-game-game-game.
To games from 10 and my obbietary for the next decade for the next decade is to try to make the world in the real life;
To do that I have a plan, and it's in convincing more people, including you, I spend all more time playing games and interesting.
So we spend three billion hours a week playing online.
Some of you might think, "It's a good time spent play."
perhaps too long time, considering how many problems we have to solve we have to solve in the real world.
In fact, in my research, I was in the Futuro, actually is the contrary.
Three billion hours a week are not enough.
In fact, I think that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we have to increase remarkably the number.
I have calculated that the total we need is 21 billion hours of play every week.
It's probably an idea a very counterintuitive, so the repeat, so the repeat, to repeat the concept.
If we want to solve problems that are hunger, poverty, global climate change, global warming, obesity, I think we need to have the environment, for at least 21 billion hours at least 21 billion hours at least at the end of the next decade.
This is why. This image reassume because I think that I think is so important for the survival of the human species --
This is a Photographer Phil Toldan, he wanted to take the emotion.
So he photographed of the players while they were playing it.
And this is an emotion.
If you are not used to be players of this picture.
You can probably notice the sense of urgence, a little bit of fear, but also a very deep, a very deep attention, a very deep attention, a very difficult.
If you are used to play some details, you will notice some details around the eyes, and around at the eye are optimism.
And the skulls stopping show.
This is an abitual player at a step from something called a "Victorial Vittory of Epic."
Ah, it's a term that you've already heard.
So we have the abitual players between us.
A life; a life-a-achieved result that you can't be in when you don't get it to you when you don't get it.
It's almost beyond the shock of the imagination, and when you get is a shock to find what you're really about.
This player is at a step from an epical victory.
And this is the expression that we need to see about millions of resolutions of problems in the world as we deal with the next hundreds of the next hundreds of the next hundreds of the next hundreds of people who are expectations, is at a torepic.
Unfortunately this is the expressure we see in the life of all the days as we deal with the urban problems of the problems of the urbent problems
This is the expressure I call "I'm not Brn N.
I am with the "I'm not Brn in the Realtyalty."
This is a graffh in my old neighborhood of Berkeley, in California, where I made the PhD in the real life.
And this is a lot of players. We feel that we actually feel that at the fact we are not good at the games.
And I don't mean "bravi" just as "succeed," even though the success is particularly the results in the online.
But I also mean "braves" in the sense of motivated to do something important, inspired to collaborate and cooperating.
And when we are in a world online in a world honline of whether we become the best versions, the most skills to help without predicted, more to help without predict, more to focus on a problem for all the time.
And in the real life when we face a failure, when we face a hostacold, we often don't feel like this, we feel anxiod, we feel anxioxiety or Chinical.
We never prove these feelings, while I call, just not existing in a game.
So this is what I wanted to study at university.
What is that in a game we can not get any result?
How can we transport those feelings from games and apply them in the world.
So I studied games like World of Warcraft, which is really the ideal environment to solve problems.
And I began to notice some things that make the epic that so possible in the online.
The first is that, when you looked in one of these games of online, especially in World of Warcraft, there are a lot of different characters that fit to reach a mission to save the world.
But not qualsia: a perfectly adequate mission to your current level. Right?
So you can complete.
They never give you a challenge to be impossible.
But it's at the limbs. So you have to try to do it seriously.
But there is not a disock in World of Warcraft, you don't spend the time to turn the chickens, there's always something specific and important to do.
And there are many collaborators.
Anyway, hundreds of thousands of people, ready to joining your whole epick.
It's not so common in life in the real life. This feeling that we have a lot of collaborators.
And there is this epicay, this narrative that inspire, because we are there, and what we're doing.
And then we get all this feedback positive --
You've heard about increasing levels of force, and a strength, one in intelligence.
We don't get that kind of faithful fedback in life.
When I leave this stage I won't have a talk about the audience, and you know, a bizarre in bizarre ideas.
I don't get that kind of feedback in life.
Now, the problem of collaborative environments like World Warcrafty is that gives so much soddisfation to a step from a life-step from a liver living, that we decide to move all our time in these games.
It's better than reality.
This is why we have all the World of Warcraftators of Warcraft have spent 593 million years to solve the virtual problems of Azeroth.
This is not necessarily a negative thing.
But let's put it in project, 5.93 million years ago was the time when one of our ancestors went up in the feet.
That was the first primary.
OK, so when we talk about how long we are investing in play, the only way we are investing in the playing, the only way we have more heart than we are evolved to human evolution, which is an extraordinary, because we found that we're changing all this time, we're changing what we are going to play more and more heart. We are going to work more heart.
This is true, I believe that.
Think of all this interesting statistics.
It was published by a researcher at the university Carnagie Mellon.
The typical young average today in a very strong culture, it will have spent 10,000 hours players, it will have spent 10,000 hours play online, at the age of 21 years.
10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons.
First of all, for the children in the United States 10,080 hours is the exact number of hours that I spent in school from the fifth if you're present all the days.
So we have an entire parallel of parallel education in which the young people learn how to be bony to be the playful, I think about the time at school in which they learn everything else.
And some of you have probably read the new book of Malcolm Gladwell, "Fuorlasse."
If you have done it by his theory, the theory of 10,000 hours for the success.
It's founded on a very good research in the cognion, which is that if we are dedicating 10,000 hours of the fruiting at 10,000 hours of the fruiting of genes in that field.
We will be good at that something as the best people in the world.
So, what we now have now to disposing is a whole generation of young people who are the genes.
So, the question is, "Esattly, what do do do is bones?"
because if we could figure out what this is going to have a amount of human resources without previous precedentented.
This is the number of people in the world spending an hour to play online.
These are our genes.
500 million people who are extraordinary,
And in the next decade we will have another billion players that are extraordinarily good at that are extraordinarily good at that something.
If you didn't know it, this is what it expect: the video games is developing platforms developing platforms that will grow power and work with the cellular network rather than the Internet cellular band so they work with the Internet cellular bandwide instead of players around the world, particularly in India, China, Brazils will connect online.
The estimate is a billion players in the next decade.
This will bring us to 1.5 billion acabitual players.
So I started thinking about what these games are transforming us into genes.
These are four of them are aspected. The first is a very good urgent urgy.
Okay. Think about it as an extremaining form.
A optimism is the desire to act immediately to deal with an obstacle, with the conviction of having a reasons of success.
The abitual players believe that a life life is that a life; it is always worth to try and prove it now.
The abitual players are not with hands.
The abitual players are virtuosis in the tunes of social tram.
There are many interesting interesting research, that show how we find more people after played with them, even though they brought us.
And the reason is that it takes a lot of people to play with somebody someone: we have a confidence that will play with us, that will play with the same bike and the same bieths with the same bikets, and that will be bringing to the game.
So, playing together with the legames of the cooperation.
So the result that we really have more robust social relationships.
Cently game.
You know, there's one reason for the World of Warcraft player in the World of Warcrafty player as a part-time.
It's why we know, as we are playing, that we actually are happier working soon, rather than relaxing or losing time.
We know that we are optimized, as humans to work with something that has meaning.
And the abitual players are willing to work soon -- if it was an adapted.
Finally, a meaning.
The abitual players are associated with wonderful missions, to humans to the planetary stories on the planetary.
For example, a little information to help create a context.
You know all Wikipedia, the biggest wiki Wikipedia,
The second wiki biggest wiki wiki is about 80,000 articles is the wiki of Warcraft Cin' people use it every month.
They have more information on World of Warcrafty in the Internet, that on any other argument in any other wiki wiki.
They are building a epical opera.
They are building a source of information about the World of Warcraft.
OK, these are the four superpoters that together together constituting one thing.
The abitual players are individuals of great great super-power.
These are people who believe that they are individually capable to change the world.
The only problem is they believe that they are capable to change the world's worlds, but not real.
This is the problem I'm trying to solve.
There is an economic named Edward Castrona.
Her studies are brilliant. It's just studiing the reason that people invest so much time, and the money in the online.
He said, "We are looking at what costs are going to costs nothing less an exode mass and online."
And it's an economy, so it's rational, and he says, -- I am not like me, I am a gamer of games, I are exuberant.
But he says that this is a perfect thing that this is a perfectly sense, because abitual players can get more in the world in the real life.
They can have more solid social relationships in a game that not in real life.
They reward a better feedback and feel more rewarded in a game that not in real life.
So, in the real world for now, it's perfectly reasonable for actors, spending more time in the virtual world in the real world of virtual world in the real world is so I think this is reasonable for now but not in any ways, an ideal situation, we need to start making the real world more similar to a game.
Here is an inspiration from something that happened 2,500 years ago.
These are given antiches, facts of the peaking of joysticks and cleaning wonders and very wonderful. And these are the first tools. And these are the first tools that they were doing by humanity.
If you know the writers of the ancient Greek of history.
It's the story of the people invented and why.
Erodote that the games in particular, particularly the games of did, were invented in the Lidia, during one period.
That caresty was so severe, that the Lidia of the Lidia decided to do something impended.
People suffering, population was in revolted, was a revolution situation, they need a revolution.
So, secondly, they invented the games of and they had a validated law a valida for all the rule.
One day, everyone would eat at all.
The next day everyone would be played.
And they diving so deeply in the games of too, from the moment that playing is so involved, and they diving us in a state of game, that ignored the fact that they ignored the fact that they have nothing to eat.
And so one day they did, and one day they eat.
And secondly, they spent so 18 years old, surviving the carestia eating a day and playing that following the following.
I think this is exactly the way we use games at the day.
We use games to get the suffering.
We use games to move away from everything that doesn't work in our real environment, from all that doesn't work in our real environment, from all that you don't know, life that we need from games.
But we don't need to stop here.
This is decided, after 18 years after 18 years, the caresty was not going to get improve, so the decise that they would play a last reach.
They were the whole given the whole gives in the middle of a dy; and the winner winner winers of that parteach to an adventure.
And they went to look for a new land where you can liver a new land where you live, leaving the number of people to survive with the resources available to survive their civilization from some other hand, where you could prosperity to be.
This is a little bizarre -- right?
But Recently in the DNA have revealed that the Epusks that they would then brought the same DNA of the Lidia.
So, they were very scientists suggested that the story of Erodot is a real story.
And geologists have found out of a cooling global cooling that almost 20 years and that could explain the caresty.
So this incredible story could be true. It could be true. They could actually save their culture play, refugees in for 18 years then to be so inspired and knowing how to come up with the game to the point to save so much civilization.
Okay, we can do it.
I call to World of Warcraft from 1994.
It was the first game of strategy in time of the World of Warcraft. This 16 years ago.
They played at 18 years, we played in Warcraft for 16. We played in Warcraft for 16.
I say, we are ready for our epic game.
They would go half of the population of a new world.
This is where we tragging the idea of 21 billion hours of play a week.
Let's do it that half of us agree to go to play a day to play a day to play a day to play a day to play when we don't solve the real world.
Istitute what you're going to say, "How do we solve the real world problems in a game. Well, this is what I dedicated my work during the last last last few years, I spent the Istitute for the Futuron for Futuuron for Fut.
In our Palo offices. We have this stending that express our idea of how we should relate with the future.
We don't want to try to predict the future.
What we want to do is -- the future.
We want to imaginate the best results and then we want to make the chance to transform them actually concret.
We want to imagine victors for the epic that for people to make the tools to make them.
I'm going to show you a very short three games that I realized and I'm an attempt to make the tools to create the instruments of the epic in their future.
This is "Mondo Sencience."
We did this game in 2007.
It's an online online in which you try to survive a oil car.
The charge is not real, but we published enough material honline to make that the way, and to make real life as if we were in the game, as if we were in the game, records in the game, and doctors that are in the game, and dopodies that show exactly the oil, the things that are not available, the things that are not available impact on the food
The impact on the transportation, if there are closed, if there are revolts, and you have to think about how you liver your life if this was real. To she's going to ask you to have a blog about it, to publish video, to publish video, to publish --
We started this with 1,700 players in 200700 players in 2007, and we looked at them from then for three years later, and what I can tell you is that it's a transform.
No one wants to change the way they live only because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world.
But if you dive them in an adventure and says, "We don't have more oil.
This is an amazing story. A adventure that you can particip!
You're just going to see how you survived."
Most of our players had the habits that has learned in the game.
So, for the next game, I wanted to save the world, we decided to measure the world, we decided to measure higher, a bigger problem.
We did a game called Superstruct, the Istitute for the Futuro, and the premise was a supercomputed that humanity has only another 23 years on this planet.
The supercomputing was called "Sistema of Allerta Estination of the Global."
We asked people to get online up almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer.
You know the Jerry Bruckheimer, forming a team -- there's only a team from the dream. There is astronauty, scientist, the galeot, and they have all something to do to save the world, but in our game, but in our game, and they have a part of the future of the human future of resources, the future of resources and the future of resources of health, the future of healthcare of health, the security and the future of previences.
8,000 people played for eight weeks, they've generated 500 generated solutions that you can find if you go online and try to Google "Superstruct."
And finally, the last game, the last game, it will start the three of the marze. This is a game Istitute of the World Bank.
If you complete the game I was looking at the Istitute of the Bank, like the Innovator Social Innovator 2010.
We are with university shooting university shoot for sub-Saharan Africa.
There is a comic story of comics, it increases through local ability, collaboration, sustainability, the imagination and invented it.
I want to invite all of you to share this with young people who are in the world, in particularly in the developing areas of the development, which may benefit from an unto start imagining the unhappiness to save the world.
It's now to end up.
I want to ask a question.
What do you think about going to happen?
We all have these incredible players that are the players that are the plants that are the pilot of projects that we could do it, but no one of those rescued the world.
Well, I hope that you are agree with me that the abitual players are an human resources that we can use to do work in the real world that games are a powerful platform, that games are a powerful platform for change, that we have these incredible superpounds, the capacity of a social trama social tram, this optimism of meaning.
I really hope that we can come up with playing games that have important, to survive on this planet to survive on this planet for another century, and my hope is that you joined to me in and participate in like this.
When I look at the next decade, of two things are so so that we can make any future, and we can figure out, and that we can imagine whatever we want.
So, I say, we start to the games that will change the world.
Thank you.
For a few time I got interested in the placebo, it can seem something that a magic that a magician if you don't consider from my point of view of that is not to be considered at the point to become something that is failed to become something real." In other words, the way, the words of sugar. In other words, the effect, just because the person thinks the person thinks the person thinks about it, just because the person thinks the person thinks
that what is happening is had to a drug or something like --
The pain of pain, for instance, if you believe that they have a measurable effect.
Something about it becomes something true for perception that if it ha.
I want to show you a magic rodimental trick, very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that is in all of the books for children in the '50.
I learned it from only Cub Scout Magic in the 't.
And I'm going to pick it up for you and so I'm going to explain it.
And so I'm going to explain why I explain because I explain it.
Here's what happens.
The colcholer; you can examined; my hand, that you can examinated.
I'm just going to be the kek in my clear in my clear --
I go to my hand.
To be safe from or save my hand.
Now I string my wise.
So you can see that ever you can see that you can go through.
And the purpose of this is simple.
I go to open my hand, and if everything went up, and if everything went up, and if it was all all the wonderful southern of the southern of the skin.
In fact, stay so saving that I can school, and the narrow doesn't fall.
Nothing goes on or down from my hand.
There's no trical. You can examine any thing.
Ta-day!
This is a trick, which often often often is to babies.
which are interested in the magic because you can learn a lot about the English is about the toss of metodologically simple.
Most of you in this room knowing this trick.
This is what happens to Tengo into my hand.
I say I'm saving my wrist.
to make sure that nothing hand or coming from my hand. This is a good thing.
The reason I'm keeping the polystage is because that's the secret of illusion.
In the moment my hand is moving away away from you, this dit here, my indically, you move away from where I was in a position that he had to be in a position that kind of go out so Bello!
There's somebody who didn't have a childhood here.
It's like here, right.
And when I walk around the way I move forward.
We can talk about why it is why don't you notice there are only three fingers down because the mind, and the way that you would make information, no one, two, two, three. Three.
But that's not the point. Right? And when I open my hand, Of course, remains not through the magnetism, but through their own indicate to my own indict.
And when I clock my finger, this movement, this movement, this movement cocks the dit that goes back back.
Let my hand. The knife is away.
It's a trick that you can do with your friends and near. Thank you.
Now, what has to do with the placebow?
I read one studio, one year ago, a year ago that I brought me the mind.
I'm not a doctor or a researcher, where it was an amazing thing.
It seems like a placebo in the shape of a white pill, it made like an aspill, just like an aspill, just a white pill, it has a measurable.
But if you change the shape and you give the placebo, under the shape of a smaller, and blue color, and you print a letter is visibly more effective letter is visibly more effective lessly act.
Even though no one of the drug has a drug pills.
But a white pill, it's not effective as a blue pill.
You know? I really jump it.
But anyway, it's not here that you end up.
The capsule are more effective than any forms.
A capsule capsule that is from a part and red by the other is better than a white white of a white capsule.
The dosage has a role.
A pill, two times a day is not so effectively as three pills -- I don't remember the statistics.
But the thing is,
that these dosages have a role.
And the shape has a role.
And if you want the definitive placebond you have to use a needle.
Right? A syringe with something -- a couple of cycs.
you start it in a patient --
This is an image so strong in their mind, much stronger than the white pill.
This is real, this graphs -- I'm going to show you another time when we're going to have some slides.
The point is that the white pill, it's not as effective as that blue -- it's not as effective as the blue of a doctor.
And no one of these is a druging quality.
It's just your belief that makes them in your copro and raft the effect.
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it at a magic trical.
And to do something that is a final trick.
And we know from the studio that when you want an effect you have to use the needle.
This is a seven chicken chicken spills.
The sterilip a little bit.
This is my carne. This is not a special Carn of Damian.
This is my skin. This is not a special effect.
I'm going to hole my skin and make this skin.
If you try to blausea -- if you get easy -- I did it for some friends in the tree, the other night, and for some that I didn't know -- and a woman is almost seven.
So if you try to be easily, I suggest that you don't look for the next 30s -- in fact, I will do the first part of here -- you know, I'm going to do the first part of the right here.
You could see, you can look at another side.
This is what happens, right here, the beginning of my cardle at the bottom of my arm.
Sorry. I'm impressing you?
And now a little bit through my skin, and out of the other hand, like that.
Now, we are in the same position that we were with the cold's trick.
More or not, but you can't count my fingers now, right?
So I'm going to show you one of the two three, four, five, five, five.
I know what people when they see this.
Three of them, "I'm not going to be so stupid to just the skin to fun a few minutes."
So, let me leave you leave a bunch of gurder.
How do you seed? Abast.
Yes, I know I am going to tell "Ok, I don't have seen it good."
People in the rooms are coming in.
Let me show it from neighborhood.
This is really my skin. It's not a special effect of Hollywood.
This is my carne, and I can turn it around.
Sorry, if you hear it from another part, not watching it.
People in the bottom or going to be going to say, "B, it's clear to some effect, but if it was true --
You can see a hole here and a hole here, if it was to be blood."
Well, I'm going to get a little blood for you.
Here's here.
I just levers the needle.
I can see that there are no arm, and I would see that there are no stops.
But I think in this context, and with the idea of getting something truth, and I turn it into something true, I would leave it in something true, I should go from stage.
We're going to see a different times in the next days I hope you can't see the time. Thank you very much.
So, in my life I met a lot of fish.
I just loved two.
The first one was a passionate story.
It was a beautiful weight, carnoon is one of the most vends on the menu.
Which fish.
What's even better than it was from a training standards of environmental sustainability.
So, you feel like the consciousness in selling it.
I was involved in a relationship with this beauty for different months.
A day, the company called me and asked me to talk about a dedicated event to a dedicated event to sustainability of the environmental sustainability.
"Yeah."
This was a company that was trying to resolve what has became an unimaginable problem.
How do we continue to have the fish in our menu?
During the last 50 years we've caught in the same way we have rased in the same way.
The destroy was tremendous.
90 percent of the big fish -- the ones that I like so much the tunes, the halikes, the halike, the fish are reduced by the number.
There is no remainly swimming.
So it turns out to us or less water, the water, the weight, the weight, will be part of our future.
There are a lot of topics.
The fish heavy heavy heavy, for least the greatest part of it, and they are inefficiently.
A big problem is that there is that there is a 15 conversation rating 15 to one.
That means that it takes 15 books of wild fish to get a book.
It's not very sustainable.
And even the knowledge is not a great thing.
So here is there there was a company that was trying to do it in the right way.
I wanted to help them.
The first day of the event I went to the head of the audience.
Camolar.
"Wom," I said, "long to understand you are famous to get so far, you are hunting, in the open sea that you don't inat."
"Eat," he said, "We're so far away from the coast that our shoes are diluits, not concentrat."
And then we put it in a world to particularly a world to particular."
"The conversion rate rate rate rate in on."
"The best in the sector."
2.5 to one, fantastic.
"2.5 to one thing? What do you do to eat fish?"
"Proteam.
"Grande," I said, "You know, I got the telephone.
That night, I was at bed, I thought, what the hell is a sustainable protein sustainable?
So the next day later, a little before the event, I called Don.
I said, "Doon, do you have some examples of sustainable proteins.
He said he didn't know it, and he would have asked him.
Well, I talked to a little people of the company and no one sepping response.
And finally until I spoke to the biologist of it.
We call him D.
"Don," I said, "Do you make some examples of sustainable proteins sustainable proteins?
Well he mentioned some of them eating on the basis of fish and then he said, "People of the chicken."
I said, "Cood?"
He said, "Yes, skin, pelles, sweat, sat and sat and processed to eat."
I said, "What's percentage of your eat is made of chicken?"
I thought, you know, two percent.
"Well, it's about 30 percent."
I said, "What's the one of sustainable in giving us the chicken?"
There was a long pause, and then he said, "There are just too many chickens on the world."
I told me about this fish.
No, not because I'm one of those virtuosis of the good food.
Well, I mean, the truth.
No, I actually told me about this fish because, I'm going to go after that conversation, the fish knew about chicken.
The second fish is a different love story.
It's a romantic history that kind of story that you know the fish and more you know.
You eat it for the first time in a restaurant in the Spain.
My journalist friend had talked about the fish.
It basically had us met it.
He went to the table color, he had a brilliant white color, almost scintilling.
The chef was cotten too much,
It basically had to be cotted.
Incredible, was still delighted.
Who is able to make a fish so good after you get it after the stream?
I'm no, but this guy yes.
Chiamulate Miguel.
It's actually called Miguel.
No, she didn't cotten the fish, and it's not a chef.
For the less, not in the sense that we intense alone.
This is a biologist in Veta Palma that is a fish of fish in the groundary corner of the Spain the Western Western the War.
And at the '80s the '80s was managed by the top.
They were boven on what first was essentially a stage.
They were given the earth by building a serious series of canals, so the water in the river.
Well, they couldn't make it work work the thing out of economic view.
And from ecologic view, was a disaster.
He killed something like 90 percent of the birds, and looking at the place, it's a lot of birds.
So, in 1982 a company with a consciousness with a consciousness buying the ground.
What do you do?
They actually reverse the flow of water.
therally, inverse the whole ruttor.
Instead of condition from the grounding the channels.
They start to give all the canals.
They created a 27 mile wallevening from 27 mile miles, diggs and in this process, Miguel and Miguel and this process, Miguel company.
The walling is incredible.
I mean, you never have seen something like this.
Look at the horizon that it seems to be far a million miles and everything that you see are the inonline canals.
I was there just a little time ago with Miguel.
It's an amazing three quarters Charles Darwin and a quarter Crocodile Dundes.
Okay? We were doing it in the middle and I anxide in the middle and I was in front of the knee. I had the knee.
First indicates a nurse of a white rare.
Then he explains the minerals of the fitoplankton then you see a type of fish bunch of the Tanzania.
It turns out that Mikume have great part of his career at at Mikumy National Park in Africa.
I asked him how it had become a fish expert of fish.
He said, "Pestop? I don't know anything weight.
I'm an expert in relationship."
And the soon after it still stuck up on the rares, algae and algae and strange water.
Don't get me wrong, this was very fascinating, that is, it was very fascinating.
It's interesting, but I was in love in love.
And my head was continuing to rethink that delivered fish fish that I had eaten the previous night.
So I got it and I said, "What does your fish so good?"
He indicated algae.
"I know, also, I know, algaes, the fitoplankton, the relationships, yes, it's incredible.
But your fish what you eat at it?
What's your conversation rating rate time?
Well, I'm telling me how their is a system so rich so that the fish is going to eat exactly what they would send in a wildly environment.
The biomass of plants, the fitoplankton, is the whole zooplankton, is all that feeds fish us.
The system is so in the healthy that it's completely.
There are no eat.
Have you ever heard about an enlievening that it doesn't give to his animal?
Miguel later, I was driving around the ground with Miguel and I said, "In a place like this that looks so natural from any evening that has ever been seen, as you measure succeed?"
In that time, it was like a movie of a movie had ordered the change of the set.
We went to the corner, and we saw a scene between the most incredible thousands and thousands of fenicotters of a rose rose rose that was lost at the eye.
"That was the succeed."
"Look at their pange.
They are banking.
Banchecking? I was completely confused.
I said, ""Miguel, but are they not banchecking with your fis?"
"Yes."
"We lose about 20 percent of the fish and the eggs of fish for the birds.
Last year on this property there were 600,000 birds over 250 species.
It has become the biggest and one of the most important private health private for the birds in all the Europe."
Dissi: "Miguel, but a releaving population is not the last thing that you want to be in a fish of fish heaven?"
He would have the head of it.
He said, "We try to extentensive way I don't mean that I mean.
This is an ecologic network of it.
The fenicotters eat eat eat are the gambers.
The legs are eating phitoplankton.
So, the most is rose the bread of fenicotters so the best is the system."
OK, then we reassume that doesn't give you to eat to eat at his animals and that measure his predators of his predators.
A heavening of fish but also a bird healthcare for birds.
Ah, by the way, those phenicotters don't even have to be.
They do the nest in a 150 miles where the conditions of the soil conditions are best for the building.
Every morning, they fly for 150 miles to the evening and every night, they do another 150 miles for the back back of the back back back of it.
They do it because they are able to follow the white line of the A92.
On it seriously.
I would imagine something like the march of penguins so I looked at Miguel.
And I said, ""Miguel, fly for 150 miles to the dealing and then fly 150 miles of night for you?
They do it for their little ones?"
I looked like I had just quoted a song of Whitney Houston.
He said, "No, they do it because the food is better."
I didn't tell you about the skin of my loved load that was delighting, and I usually don't like the skin fish.
I don't like sweep, I don't like the rock.
It's that kind of acre, as you asphalt.
Not cooking.
And yet, when I ended it in the southern of the Spain of the Spain doesn't know anything about fish skin fish.
He had a sweet and clean was like giving a dead to the ocean.
I said to Miguel, and he wannus.
He said, "The skin is like a too.
It's the last defense that whatever you enter in the fish.
It has evolved to hold the impurity."
And then he said, "But our water is not impurity."
Okay. A traevent that doesn't feed her fish there.
A leaving that measures the success of his predators.
And then I realizing that when he says that the halling has not mindset up very much the way because the water that fluid is from the riverse of the rivers from the rivers of the rivers that leads with all the things that the rivers tend to bring totoday, contaminers tend chemicals.
And when you go through the system and you get the water is more than when it's entrane.
The system is so healthy, that cleaning water.
So, not only one hallevation that doesn't feed his animals not just a training that measures his predators but an allevening his predors but a lead of a cleaning of water and not only for those fish and not only for those fish and not only for those fish but also for you.
Because when the water, it goes into the Atlantic of Atlantic.
It's a drop in the ocean, I know but I know the well-sold and so you should do that because this story of love, because this story of love, because this story is instructive.
You could say that it's a recipe for the future of the food is that you talk about fish bovins.
What we need to now is a radically new conception of agriculture in which the food has a very good knowledge.
But for many people, this is a little too radical.
We are not really passionate about food.
We are friends.
We love the marketing little farmers.
We love the little familiar farms.
We talk about local food.
I love biology.
And when you say that these are the things that will make sure the future of the good food on somebody somewhere alg, "Hey, even to me accions, but how do you can feeds the red phenicotters -- but how do you can feeds the world inter?
How do you think I can feed the world?"
Can I be syn?
It's a question that I don't like that.
No, not because we produce already have more than enough to be able to feed the world.
A billion people suffer the fame today.
A billion -- more than how many people have ever been -- because of the enormous amount of diality diality in distribution.
You see, I don't like this question because it was determined the logic of our system for the last 50 years.
To the brain erbivors of monoculture, support chemicals, chemicals to the fish terrain fish and all this time the fish industry, and all of this time the weight industry, "If we can feed more people in the economic way, what do you do in the economic way that we do that?"
This was the motivation.
It was the justify.
It was the rain of American agriculture.
We should be called it for what a liquid industry in a liquid industry that is fast ecological capital that makes it a meant as possible.
This is not agriculture.
Our panies today is not because of the forners in decreasing but for the resources in the resources not for the last mechanics, but for the earth of the earth, not for motortile, but for the fresh water, not for the fresh, but for the rainforests and not for the weights, but for the rainforests in the sea fish.
You want to feed?
We start asking -- how are we going to feed ourselves?
Or between, how can we create the conditions that conditions that conditions that are at every local community of feed?
So we don't look at the agricultural model.
This is an old model.
All on capital, chemistry and cars, and it has never really really produced anything good to eat at it.
Instead, we look at ecologic model.
That's what matters on two billion years of experience on work.
We look at Miguel as Miguel as Miguel at Miguel and farm that are not only producers.
If I really have to be the best of them are chef than I have.
You know, it's going to be good, because if that will be the future of the good food, will be delighted.
Thank you.
I grew up with an injunk diet,
I have to take a high school, an hour to a school.
And I was always immersed in a book, a phanteful book that was carrying my mind in other money, and sativity, in narrative form, that insafer of curiosity that I had.
And that curiosity would also be in the fact that every time I wasn't at school in school I was out in the boss of samples, for several care of samples, or snakes, or snakes, and I would look at the microscope.
I was a real geek of science.
But it always was trying to figure out the world, understand the limits of the possible.
And my love for the science science science science actually seemed to reflect the world around me, because what was going on, in the 1960s -- we were going to go to the moon, we were going to the moon, we were going to the moon, Jacques Couau was entering in our room with his fantastic documentary that showed us animals and places that we would not even imagining that we wouldn't even image.
So, everything seemed to be giving my passion for the phantom.
And I was an artist.
I knew drawing.
And because there were no video games that there were no video games this sort of a movie of the computer, and I had to create these pictures in my head.
From children, when we read a book, we all had to go through the description of the author, put something on the screen of our mines.
And so, my answer was painting was painting creatures, alienes, aliens, robots, all this stuff.
At the mathematics lessons I was always beccef behind the book.
This is why creativity had to find a way out of the uses in some ways.
And this happened a very interesting thing about this: Jacques Cousteau programs very involved for the fact that there was a world at the fact that there was an alien right here on the Earth.
I would not go to a space world on a alien world on a space.
It looks very unlikely to be very unlikely.
But that was a world where I could go to the truly here, right here on the Earth, the richer and exotic of what I could have legate reading these books.
So, I decided I would become a 15-year-old.
And the only problem was that I lived in a small Chanada, at 600 miles from the closer to the close close close to the close close up.
But I didn't leave to go through it.
I put together my dad until he found a immersion school, New York, New York, just passed the New York, just passed the board of where we live in.
And so I got to take the certified in a bunch of YMCA in the winter in Buffalo, New York.
And I wouldn't have seen the ocean, for two years until we spent in California.
From then, in the last 40 years, I spent about 3,000 of the underwater, and 500 of these hours in the submergiles.
And I learned that the deep of the ocean, even deep oceans, even the oceans are very deeply of life in our imagination.
The imagination of nature is without boundary of our limitations.
Agains today, I'm intimate from what I see when I do the dives.
And my love history with the ocean history continue, more strong than they never sted.
But when I picked a career, I picked up a career, I choose a movie.
It seemed to be the best way to concilit this storytelling with the smania to create pictures.
And as a kid I was very constantly comic and so on.
So it was the only way to put together pictures and stories.
Everything came back.
And of course the stories I picked up telling was a phantom stories of "Earth" and "The Abys" and "The Abys."
And with "The Abys" I joined my love, for depth and the diving with a film.
So, I make the two passions.
The Abys" came out of something interesting that was to solve a specific narrative problem in that film, which is to create that kind of liquid water creatures -- we adopt the generated splanning computer.
And so it's born the first character to the morbid surface and animated to the computers that had ever seen in a movie.
And even if the movie didn't do many money, I would say that at malachievement, I've been testimony of something extraordinary, all the audience was ipated from this magic apparently.
You know, it's Arthur Clarke law for that every technology is very advanced is indistinguishable of the magic of it.
They were seeing something magic --
And this was excited to me.
And I thought, "Fantastic, this is something that must be adopted in the Chinographic art art.
So, with "Thinator 2," my movie film, we went very far.
Laving with the Industrial Light and Magic, we created the metal of a liquid metal in that movie.
And it worked. And we have a new piga.
And we got the same result with an audience.
But we've gained a little bit of the more with that movie.
So, by making a line between these two points of experience, I came to the conclusion that this would be a new world of creativity for the movie artists.
So I put a company with Stan Winston, my friend Stan Winston, who was the main Stan Winston, who was the main truch and designers in that period, and we called Digital Domain.
And the principle of the society was to leave the past, the analogic of the present present prints and so on, and then go directly to the digital production.
And so we did and gave us a competitive advantage for a little bit.
But we were back in half the '90s in the part of the design of creatures and characters, which is what we had the society.
So, I wrote this text called "Haw" with the intension of the visual effects of the visual effects of the visual effects and realistic realistic characterists, and realistic realistic characters and realistic realistic world at the computer.
And the whole thing was given to the mitting.
The kids of the society told me that we wouldn't be able to do it for a bit.
So, I have accanted it, and I did this movie of a big ship.
And I studio I throw up there like a "Romeo and Juliit on a ship.
It would have been a story of epica, a passionate story.
Segretly, what I wanted to do was to do was to see the back of the Titanic."
That's why I made that movie.
And it's true. The studio didn't know it.
But I convinced them. I said, "We will go to the back of the back of the living.
We will use it for the beginning of the movie.
It's going to be very important. It's going to be a great marketing ganut.
And I convinced them to fundamentally expedition.
It seems crazy. But this brings us back to the imagination that creates the reality.
Because we really created a reality and six months after I found on a submersible Russian and a half of deep in the North Atlantic of North, to look at the true Titanic from a hunt of oblue from a hunt of the movie, not in a very high definition, but I really really really.
I stayed up stop.
And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build Chinepredent and a lot of other things.
But I was remained by those diving from those dives, it was like a space.
Where all was highly technical, and required out enormous planning.
You put in this hair, you go down in this hairly environment, where there aren't hoping to be saved, that you can't go back behind it.
And I thought, "Fantastical. It's like living in a phantom film.
It's really great."
And so, I was affected by the depth of the deep ocean.
Of course, curiosity, the scientific component scientific component --
It was everything. It was it.
It was curiosity. It was imagination.
And it was an experience that Hollywood didn't have to offer it.
Of course, I could imagine a creature and create a visual effect. But I couldn't imagine what I would see out of the oblame.
In our next speection I saw creatures with hydrothermal creatures and times, sometimes, things that I had never seen before, things that nobody had ever seen before, that actually wasn't even described by the time we saw and imagined.
So I was all from this and I had to do more.
So I took a curious decision.
After the success of "Titanic," I said, "OK, I put from my work of Hollywood, and I do the explorer of Hollywood, and I do the explorer for a little bit.
So we started planning these speditions.
We have been found to go to Bismark and exploring it with tized.
We went back to the back of Titanic.
We took little robots that we had created with the optical fiber.
And the idea was to go inside and make a smart inside of the ship, which had never been done.
No one had ever been watched in the inside of the inner of doing it, so we created the technology to do it.
So here I am here on the bridge of the Titanic, sitting in a submergible, looking at the assumption that seemed like this, where I knew that they played the violinists.
And I'm driving a little vehicle through the corridge,
When I say, I'm driving, but my mind is in the vehicle.
It seemed to be physically present in the back of the Titanic.
And it was the most surreal experience that I've ever lived -- because I had ever lived -- because I had before you turn the corner I knew what was going to be for, before the lights of the vehicle, because I had the revehicle for months around.
And the set was based on a replenge of the ship.
So it was an absolutely extraordinary.
And it really made me realizing that in the experience of the telepresence that you can experience through these lawyars the mind is injected in this other form.
It was very profound.
And it may be a little aboutside of what could happen in some decade when we start to start having cyborg for explorations or other kinds of motives of the world in some kind of post-human futures that I can imagine, from a lover.
So, we did these spedictions, and we actually started to appreciate what there was there like there were these stadepth of the ocean where there were these staordinary.
And basically, they're aliens right here on the Earth.
They live in a chemosynthesis.
They don't surviving in a system based on the sunlight of the sunlight, how we do.
So, you see animals that live nearly in the water at 500 degrees.
It seems even impossible to be impossible to be there.
I was really interested in the same time I was really interested in space, again, is the flu, again, is the influence of the phanten's science --
And I ended up in space environment, really engaged with NASA sitting in the board of NASA, planning missions, go to Russia, go to Russia, go to Russia, go to Russia, go to Russia, and all of these things to fly to fly to the international spacecraft with our 3D.
It was fascinating.
But what I ended up to do is to bring the space scientists with us in the useful scientists with us
And bring them down because they could have access -- astrobiologists -- astrobiologists, people interested in these extreme environments, bring them down and allow them to see and allow them to see, take samples and so on.
So, we were going to go around documentars, but we actually made the science, the space
I closed the ringing between the phantan's philan; I had to do those things for true.
And you know, during this way, I learned a lot.
I learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot of science.
Everybody think that a recorder should be a leader, the capitan of the nave, or something like that.
I didn't know anything about leadership before I had to do all of those speditions.
Why I had to say, "What am I doing here I was going to five?
Why am I doing that? What are you going for?"
You don't make anything to do all these spectacle.
There is maladish. There is no famy.
People think about that I went to the "Titanic" and "Did you and I was walking around the chickens,
I did all these film, all these documentary for a public so limited audience.
No famy, no glorious, no money. What am I doing?
I'm doing it for the task of the task -- and the ocean is the biggest challenge that exists, for the bridge of discovery, and for that strange displacements when a small group of shape a team deep form.
Because we were all with 10-12 people, working together for years.
Sometimes in the sea for 2-three months of the movie.
And in that legame, you realize that the important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you, when you finished a compit that you can't explain to no another.
When you go to the earth and you said, "We had to do this, and the fiber eith, and the attention, and that all of technology, and the whole technology, the whole technology, the whole technology, the most human aspects of the perfomance when you work in multiple -- you can't explain it. It's what perhaps they have lived something together and know that they never explain.
Create a wood, create a legal of respect.
When I went back to do my next movie movie that was "Hadiatar" I tried to apply the same principle of leadership as to respect their own respective respect to myself their respect.
It's really changed the dynamic.
And so here I was still once with a small group, in an inexplored territory to do "Have with new technologies that didn't exist before.
Thirreably emotional.
Tremendously engaging.
And we have become a family, in four years and a half years and a half.
And it changed my own way to make film.
People started saying that I took the organisms from the ocean and I put them on the planet in Pandora.
For me, it was the essence of the way to do business, the process in itself, that it was changed.
What can we be tracking here?
What are the lessons that we learned about?
I think the first is curiosity.
It's the most powerful thing that we can.
The imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality.
And the respect of the group is more important than all the people in the world.
Thinkers come from me and they say, "Damme some of the boy to do this."
And I say, "Don't limitation."
Other people will do it for you, you don't just do it by yourself.
And you'll be risk."
NASA is always telling this sentence: "The errr is not contemplated.
But the mistake has to be an option in art and exploration, because it's how to make a vacuum.
And no important attempt that he required innovation has been done without risk.
You've got to run these risks.
This is the thought that I want to leave you, that is that in whatever you do, the mistake is an option, but it's a fear option,
If I wanted to understand one of the great idea would be that we consume is that the together of the data that we use is greater than the sum of its parts, and that instead of thinking about how to use information to emerging new relationships so to see new relationships so to see new train new trains.
Here you see the statistics typics of deaths for age.
This instrument that use is an experiment.
It's called Pivot, and with Pivot I can pick up one cause of death, let's say the accidents.
And as we see new relationships.
The reason is that there in the central part of the people are more active.
We can do a step back and reorganize the data for death, we see that circulatory diseases and cancers are the greatest India, but not for all.
If we go forward and filming for age, let's say under 40, we see that accidents are the cause of deaths that you worry about it.
All the closer to close closer, it's worth for men.
So you will understand that visualize information and data in this is a little bit like swimming in a graphic information.
What if we can do with green data because we don't do with the content.
So here we have the cover of every Sports Illustrated every Sports Illustrated
All here.
You can go into your rooms and try and try to try to get into your rooms.
With Pivot, you can look at a decade.
Or a specific year
You can isolate one number.
So let's take the athletes that becomes in this number, their sports.
I'm a Lance Armstrong, so I click here and I see all the numbers where I apply up Lance Armstrong.
Now, if I want to give us a look at all of the cycling all the cycles?"
I do a step back and I get the visual.
And now I see Greg Lemond.
I mean, you will understand that when you navigate between the information in this closer or far from the nearest or farther away and forth. It's not only a research, it's not just browser.
But do something to read something different.
It's a half that second that will change how we can use information.
We still add this idea that it can look like a little crazy.
We took every single Wikipedia page and we reduced it to a short reduced a short that consists in a small left-synthetic area.
I'm just going to show you just the first 500 between the Wikipedia.
Even in this limitation screen we can do a lot.
You understand the most visited that are the most visited on Wikipedia.
And at this point, the government point.
We see this option we see that the Wikipedia categories of Wikipedia are the "Person" of the Anno" of Time Magazine.
This is significant because it makes something that in the Wikipedia pages.
And you can see it just just by making a step behind the together.
If I take one of these resources I can then zoomate on the "Person" from the Time Magazine.
and see them everyone.
So I see that most of the most of the government from the world of the world of the businessman from the world of businesses.
This is my body.
One is from the music.
And rather interesting, But, what it has also won a TED.
So let's go up to see all the winning of the TED Prize.
We are really navigating it as if it was a network as if it was a network, not to page for a higher level.
I want to show you another thing that could be surprising to you.
This is the New York Times.
Pivot, this applying -- I don't call browser, because it's not a browser, but you need to see pages Web -- we add this technology for zoom at every webpage, like this.
I can do a step back and I can go back and a specific selection. This is important because the only to see the pages web pages so I can see my navigation in the Internet.
I can zoom on what I did in specific moments.
And in fact, you see the state of the demo that I just presented.
I can kind of reviewing things that I've seen in day.
If I want to do a step back and see everything I can do with pieces my history or historic of my research.
And I was trying to neither the Bing, I tried the Bing, here for Live Labs Pivot.
And from here I can zoom on my page Web and just releasing from here.
A metaphor reused many times, and in every case the result of the parts, of the parts, of the parts.
Today, in the world are seen as a sort of a kind of sick.
It's about the overwhelming of information.
It's about analysis on the data.
And if we put everything on the way, we put the web underneath the web underneath instead of going from one thing to the other, we would be able to go from many other things to the structures that otherwise will re?
And then instead of feeling like we can actually get information.
Instead of it only is we can pull out of information.
And from knowledge of knowledge.
And with this thank you.
And these are all talking about happiness.
I asked to count the number of books, the word "happinity" in the title and published in the last five years, they have reached to a 40, and there was a lot of more.
There is an enormous wave of happiness, between researchers.
There is a very coaching in happiness.
Everybody wants to make people happy.
But yet, all this flow of work, there are a series of "cognitive traps, that somehow they make it impossible to elaborate ideas that make it impossible to elaborate ideas to happiness.
My talk about today is going to be about these cognitive traps, "cognitive."
And it's about people who think about their happiness, and about their own happiness, because they look at happiness, because it turns out that we are confused, because we are confuseding that we are confused.
The first of these traping is the reluttance to admit complexity.
It turns out, in fact, that the word is not a much more a word as we apply to too many camps.
And I think you can get to a particular meaning to a particular meaning, but in the massive line of the massive line, and we have to address the most complicated view of what is the "well-be."
The second trails is the confusion between experience and memoria: basically is the confusion between being happy in life and being happy of your life and being happy about your life or happy about their lives.
And these are two different concepts of the concept of happiness.
And the third is the illusion of the focus is the illusion that we can't think of any circumstance that we can't think of any circumstance.
I mean, this is a cognitive true cognitive versus --
and there's no way to do the right thing.
I would like to start with an example of one person which, after a session of questions and answers, after my lesson, telling a story.
It doesn't clearly -- Disse that while listening a synchyety of music, absolutely magnificent at the end of the record; you felt a terribly strike sound.
And then he would add it very excited about the experience.
But it wasn't true.
What it was broadly the reminding of the experience.
He had lived the experience.
And she had listened for 20 minutes of the wonderful music.
But that I didn't know that because he remained with a certain remind; the remind; the memory was everything that remained it.
What this episode tells us is, in the bottom, is that we could think about ourselves and other people in terms of two themselves.
There is a sent that lives in the present and she lives in the present and knows the present, and it's able to revive the past, but that basically has the present.
This is that it is that lives the experience and what the doctors are close -- you know when the doctor asks -- you know when I touch here?"
And then there is the "You know, you remember, this is that it reminds the dots of the history of the history of our life, and it's that the doctors that the doctors gets asked, "What are you heard in the last few day?"
or what is the way your journey in Albania?"
Those are two different entities, the theme that lives an experience and what if you remember, and consuming between two is part of the confusion of happiness.
The soup is that remember, it's a dinner.
And this process begins with a fundamental response to the memorial response -- it immediately.
We don't only tell stories when we decide to tell them.
Our memory tells us stories, oxyety, what we remains our experiences is a story.
Let me start with an example.
This is an old studio.
Which reports the experience of two patients during a painful procedure.
I'm not going to fit in details. It's not not sweeping the day, but it was painful when this study was conducted in the '90s.
You asked the patients to get their pain every 60 seconds.
And here's the results for two patients.
Those are their result.
If you ask you Choh of the two has suffered in the same way.
It's a very simple question.
Carely, Patient Bs has suffering suffering from the time.
his colonic colony wise, and for every minute of pain from the patient A BBB, the patient BB, or more.
But now there is another question: "How about these patients think they are suffering?"
and here's the surprise: Osy Patient was a very long time of the Patient of the British Patient B.
The colonic stories of colony were different given that one part of the procedure, is the way that it -- no one of these stories is particularly positive -- but one of the two is the worse -- one of the two is particularly the worst of the other.
And the worst is that where the pain was that we are in the end.
It's a negative story.
How do you know?
Because we asked these people after the colonpia, and even at the time, and even at the time, there’s been the experience, all of considered?"
and a lot of great worse for much worse for B, I remember.
So this is a direct between the discover that lives the experiences and the theme is that remember.
From the view of the site of the sand that is clear that B has been suffered more than the time
So, what you could do for the patient A, and we actually have clinical experiments and has been made -- and it would be able to extend the colonic colony of the Patient A maintainment without moving.
This is going to have a pain in the patient, but just a little bit less than before.
And by doing this for a couple of minutes -- the thing that lives the Patient experience, will be worse, and the theme that reminds the experiences of the Patient A is going to be very better, because the Patient A has a better memorial of his experience.
How do you call a story?
And this is true for the stories that are from the memories that we invent what we call the history, is changing moments of meaning and final.
The final are very, very important, and in this case, the final has dominated.
So, the sand that lives the experience lives lives his life in a continue.
Can you where you live experiences that are following and question: What happens to these moments?
And the answer is simple.
They are lost in always I mean that most of the moments of our life -- for how I calculate them -- I mean the psychological present is about three seconds of the second of the meaning that in a life, we count about 600 of a month, we have about 600,000 most of which they don't leave to that.
Most of them are completely ignored by the side.
And yet somehow you have the feeling that what happens in these moments of experience is our life.
We are the limited resources that we're spending as we are in this world.
And how to spend it, it seems to be relevant, but it's not the story that reminds for us.
So we have a smart is that reminded and a s' evidence that are fun enough.
The biggest difference between the two is how to treat the time.
From the view of the sand that lives the experiences, if you go in vacation and the second week is fun as much as the first one, then the vacation of a week.
But this is not the way that it works.
The sand that is that remember, a two-week is vagely better than a vacation of a vacation because there are no new memories.
You didn't change the story.
And in this way, the time is the critical variable, the critical variable, the thing that has reminds from the smoke.
The time has an limited impact on this story.
Well, the thing is that it reminds the experience of mind:
It's actually the thing that makes decision-because, if we look at a patient that has gotten for example, two different doctors and it's deciding what that two two chooses, what he thinks about the two chooses is what he thinks that he has the least remind, and that will be the least "negative."
The sand the experience has no voice in these choices.
In fact, we don't choose between experiences, but between the memories of those experiences.
And even when we think about our future, we don't think about our future.
We think about the future as an memories.
So you can take this situation, like a tyranny, like a tyranny, and you can think about the sand that you can think about as if it flies the experiences through the experiences, the feeling that lives the experiences, doesn't need it.
I have the feeling that when we go to the vacation is often the case that you get in vacation in good at the service of our mind is that remember.
And this is a little hard to justify.
Now, how much do we consume our memories?
This is one of the explanations that is given for the predomination.
When I think about that, I get a vacation in the Antarctican Antarcticde in a few years ago, which is one of my life, and I think relatively relatively of other vacuances.
And I probably spent to think of that trip of that trip three weeks to say, 25 minutes in the last four years.
If I ever opened the character with the 600 photographs of the journey, I would turn another time on the way, this is three weeks of traveling that you translate a hour and a half an hour and a half. It seems that there is a disrepance.
Well, I could be a little bit later, in my show, in my shoe consuming for memories, but even if you make more more than that, a question is a little question.
Why do we get a lot of weight memory of the fish that we have experience?
I want you to think about an experiment with thinking.
Imagine that during the next vacation that at the end of the vacation of the vacation of all the pictures will be destroyed, and that you take a medicine for the amnesthesia so that you don't remember nothing.
Would you have the same vacuance? And if you could choose a vacation, you have a vacation between the two is and you have to think about how to solve a conflict and you have to think about how to solve it and actually not so obvious why, if you think in terms of time.
And if you think in terms of remember, you could get another answer.
Because we choose the vacation that we do, is a problem that puts us in front of the two themes --
The two are brought two of happiness.
There are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use, one for every themselves.
So you can ask. How much is it does the experience?
And then you can ask the happy moments in life of the switch that lives the experience?
And it's about -- happiness for moment.
What are the emotions that we can measure it?
And by the way, we are now able to make us a good idea of the sand that experiences over time.
If you ask about happiness is that remember, it's a completely different thing.
It's not how happinly this is a living person.
It's about how it soddisssatissy or comfortable is the person when she thinks about his life.
It's a very different ideas.
Anyone is not able to distinguishing these two notions, it won't do anything else to create confusions, and I look at a group of student well-being, and I carry about happiness for a long period in this way.
The difference between the happiness of the sand satisfaction of the satisfaction that reminds has been recognized in the last few years, and there are now to measure the two separately, the Gallup has an institute to measure the two separately, institute from a mondial level of what they think about what they think about their life and on their experiences.
And there were other studies in this direction.
So in the last years, we started to learn about the happiness of the two issues.
And the biggest lessons that we learned is that they're very different.
You may know how a person is satissssy with your own life, and still this doesn't tell you much how happinly I'm living your liver and neighborhood.
To give you an idea of the correlation is about 0.5.
What does it mean if you meet somebody and you say, "oh, his father is 1.80 months on the 80" of how would you like her alteen?
Well, you know something about her alteeth, but with a lot of uncertainty.
You'd always have a little bit of uncertainty.
If I tell you that somebody thinks his life is at eight in a scale from one to 10 10 you will be very uncertainly uncertainly uncertainly about how happy they are with their own experiences.
So the correlation is low.
We have a certain knowledge of what you control satisfaction.
We know that money is very important, the goals are very important.
We know that being happy is to be satisssssatisfacfacfacts of time with the people that full us.
There are some pleasure of it, but these are the mains.
So if you want to be happiness about two happiness of the two of them is, you end up with very different things.
The conclusion of what I said now is that we should not think about happiness as a substitute of well-being.
This is two completely different ideas.
Actually, a very quickly, another reason why we can't think about happiness is that we can't be attention to the same things when we think about life, and when we live life.
So if you do the simple question about how happy it is how happy people in California, you can't get the correct response to the correct response to this.
When you ask this question, you should be happier in California, that in Ohio.
What happens is that when you think about life in California, you're thinking about the contradiction of California and other places, for example, that comparison is about climate.
Well, it turns out that the climate, not so important that it is that it is that the experience of the sand not very important for the reflects that is what it decides how happy are people.
But because it is that reflects is in charge, you could end -- some pottery, you could finally -- some pottery, at the end.
And it's interesting to true what will happen to happen to people who transfer in California in hope of being happier than being happier people.
Well, the issue is that lives the experiences will not become happy.
We know it.
But something going to happen. They think of being happier, because when they think they are going to remember how terrible it was time in the Ohio.
And they will think they're going to take the right decision.
It's very hard to think of clearly about well-being and I think I gave you the idea of how hard it is.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have a question for Lei.
Thank you very much.
When we were at the phone couple of weeks ago, she mentioned that a interesting result that a really interesting result that was from the Gallup.
Is it something that thinks that we still have a few minutes?
Daniel Kahennan: Yeah.
I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup in the Gallup is a number, that we were not expected.
We found that, with reference to happiness of the sand that lives the experiences.
When we looked at how the feelings feeling with the income with the income, we discovered that at 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans, on a study conducted campon a very vast conducted samples about a very vast of about 600,000 Americans, it's about 600,000 Americans, it's about a representative of 600 dollars --
CA: 60,000 dollars a year, 1:60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy, and they become smallly smallly smallly more infelse, we find a line.
I mean, I actually saw the lines of the lines so that they fit to be plated.
Clearly, what happens is that the money doesn't buy happiness happiness of the experience, but the lack of money.
In terms of the other thing is, is that remember, it's all another story.
More money gans, more happy than the most content.
This talk is not going to be on emotions.
CA: But Danny, all the efforts of Americans are about life, the freedom, the pursuit of happiness.
If people get seriously, this discovery, basically you have this discover everything that we have created, for instance, the politics, and so on.
Is it the chance that politicians and the nation in general, can they take a discovery as that seriously, and bring a public political political political political political policy?
DK: You know that I think you recognize the role of happiness in public politics.
The press of consideration will be slowly in the United States is not doubt, but in the U.K., it's becoming reality, and in other people.
People are starting to recognize that they should think about happiness when they think about public politics.
You will put a little bit and people will start to talk about if you want to study the experience of happiness or if they want to study the valutation of life that we need to start this debate.
As you think of happiness, it takes several directions to how you think about how you think about the theme of the things that you think about the outside, or of the theme that does experiences.
All this influence is the political, I think, in the years that will truly in the years that will true
In the United States, you are making effort to measure the experience of happiness of the population.
And this, I think, will go to the next decade, perhaps two of the national statistics.
CA: Well, it seems to me that this argument will be, or for less it should be, the most interesting political discussion to follow in the next years.
Thank you very much for the behavioral economy.
Thanks Danny Kaheneneman.
I'm going to talk about energy.
It may seem odd to be strange, because in my work at my work at the vaccines and seeds, things to invent and give the world to help the world for helping two billion poor better lives.
But the climate and energy, actually, are extremely important for this people, are most important for them that people, are more important for them that people that for everyone else in the world.
A worse means, for many years, loss.
It's going to get too much please.
The things will change in ways that their fragile simply can't replace.
That leads to famy. At the uncertainty.
So the climate camps, so they will be for them terrible.
Even the cost of energy is, for them, important.
In fact, if you could leave the price of one thing, to reduce poverty, you would choose poverty, you would choose poverty, you would choose a long energy.
The price of the energy is over time.
And a progreded civilization of progression of energy progress.
The carbon revolution has food revolution.
And even in the 19th century we have recurred to a quick decline in the price of electricity, the explain why we can create modern and do so many things.
So in the rich world is about electricity in an excellent situation.
But as the price scenes, for example of the half, we have to respect a new wine, the windle of CO2.
The CO2 is scaling the planet, and its equation is very simple.
The CO2 emititself causing a increase of temperature, which induces effective.
I was on the climate, perhaps even worse effect, in the sense that natural ecosystems can't get to these rapid changes and so they collapse.
The valuation of how much car temperature is because of a CO2, and like each of the two worst things the other, is uncertainly, but not a lot.
And there is certainly uncertainty about how denial negative, but they will be extremely negative.
It's about that, I often asked the best scientists -- we have we really have to reduce emission?
We can't just reduce half or a quart?
And the answer is that, until we get to zero, the temperature will continue.
It's a great challenge.
It's not like I say, "Let's go through a high-3.5 truck truck.
It's not about "absend it a little bit.
This is about a zero.
Now, we put a lot of CO2 every year, over 26 billion tons.
About 20 tons for every American.
For the poor countries, it's less than a tons bond lunch --
The average is about five tons per capita.
And somehow, we have to make progress that brings that amount of a zero.
Cemissions are constantly increased.
Only some economic changes have changed this tendency, so we need to go from increasingly to the zero-o.
This equation has four factors.
It's a series of multiplies.
We have the amount of left, the CO2, that must be bladded and the factors on the right are the population, services that in every average, the average, the average, the average request by each of the service and CO2 emititem.
We are looking at each factor and we see how we can get it.
Probably, one of these numbers has to get to zero.
It's a wisdom algebely.
We see a little bit.
The first factor is population.
The world has today, 6.8 billion people.
We go to the nine billion.
If we do a good job with new vaccines, health, healthy, we can decrease it may be about 10, 15 percent, 15 percent, but here we record a increase of about 30 percent.
The second factor is services that we use it.
Which understanding of all, the food that we eat, the TV, the TV.
They're wishing and free poverty is to provide these services for nearly all over the world.
And it's a positive thing that this number.
In the rich world in the rich billion, we probably could save and use men, but in average, every year, this number will several number of year, this number will see.
And therefore, complex, the amount of services are going to be more than doubling.
This is a very simple example.
You have the illumination in your house to make the company, but these guys, so they come and read their bucks below the streets.
How much of the efficiency -- the energy for service unit -- there are good news.
This factor is not increasing.
Thank you very different inventions, new ways of enlightening, automotive construction can be differently, for a lot of services you can decrease considerate energy.
In some services you can reduce 90 percent.
There are some of the services, like stoptics, or the aerial transportation where the margins of improvement are very, very, very nurse.
So, complex, in the best of the cases, the energy consumed will reduce for three to maybe six times.
But these first three farmers reduce emissions from 26 -- in the best of the cases, maybe 13 billion tons.
It's not enough.
We look at the fourth factor, the farming far, the amount of CO2 emititself.
The question is, can we reduce zer?
If you burn the coal, no.
If you burn the natural gasasass, no.
Almost all of the ways to produce today the electricity, to part of the renewables and nuclear -- they emit CO2.
So what we're going to have to do about global warm; that's creating a new system.
And we need "miracle."
Colly," I don't mean that I mean something impossible.
The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is a miracle.
The Internet, and his services, are a miracle.
People today have participated in the creation of a lot of miracle in many miracles.
We usually don't have a scadence, a given that miracle.
In the window and something happened; something else is not.
In this case, we have to drive through the whole speeds, and make a miracle in a very respectal times.
And I said, how do you illustrate this concept?
There are some natural example -- some natural examples, demonstration that you catch the imagination of gent?
And I thought about a year ago, when I brought to the mosquitoes and people found it fun --
And I was participate that in the world, there are people who live with the mosquitoes.
This is my idea for energy.
I decided that to fly lights would have been this year my contribution to the environment.
Here is the lights.
I say they can't even go out and they could not come out of the board.
-- now, we can invent it like this, but they're not help.
We need solutions, one or a lot of people who they are, that work on the great scale and very religion -- and though it is exploring in many directions, I think about five of them may surprising effects.
I claim to die -- geotermic fusion nuclear fusion -- biofuels.
They could also have some contribute, and if they can do more than I expect, but I'm interested in that I'm going to have to work on each of these movies, and not reaching to anything, and not reaching to nobody, because all the challenges challenges -- because all the challenges of it.
We are looking for the first fuel of fossil fueling fossil fuels or natural gasolas as it is.
And here our task looks simple, but it doesn't know, and it's not is, and it's captured the CO2, after combustion, at the camp from the camp to the room, put it somewhere, and hoping that it remains.
We have now to have the experimental technologies that catch 60 -- 80 percent of CO2, but reaching 100 percent will be very complicated and it will be difficult to get to conserving all this CO2.
The most spinous issues is still that the long term.
Who's going to truly it?
Who will be something that is literally billions of times more voluminous than any other kind of refuseful, like nuclear or else?
It's an enormous volume.
So it's a difficult problem.
Another source would be nuclear one.
But the nuclear is three big problems.
The cost, especially in the very regulated, is high.
The question of security of security, the feeling that nothing can go wrong, sick for the human operators, and that comburible combuster is not used to be used to be very beautiful.
And how do you run the scorial?
It will be able to reduce it, the concerns are so many of them are so much of it.
People need to be switch.
So, there are very much problems -- that you could solve and what you might be solved, and what you should work.
The last three of the five sources I have groups.
These are often what people often defined "renewable."
And to say the truth, the great advantage to not require a combuster not to require a combusty.
The first is that density density with these technologies is definitely inferior at that of an electrical power
It's about energy, and so many kilometers of square kilometers, of areas of areas of thousands of times more extending than a normal electrical electric electrical one.
And also these sources are intermitted.
The sun doesn't make all the day -- not all the day -- and it's not all the days, and even the wind wind sounds.
So, if you depends on these sources, you have to find an electrical energy even when the source doesn't make any electrical energy even when the source doesn't make any product.
Grosses challenges us on the constant.
And on the distribution.
For example, let's say that this source is outside.
So not only need technology, but you have to do the technology, but you also have to do the boundary board.
And finally, the problem of accumulating it.
To estimate the size of the problem, I analyzed all kinds of bacteria that we can do today, for cars, computers, telephones, every typically I complished with the amount of electrical energy.
So we need a big step forward, a 100 times than the approach.
This is not impossible, but it isn't very simple.
This problem is already when the source sources of intermittings, they produce more dolphin producing over -- 20 or 30 percent of the energy consuming
If you take it to those sources for 100 percent, you need a miracle "miraculation."
But how are we going on on this road? What is the right approach?
Is it a Manhattan? What could we solve the problem?
Many company, a hundred company, they have to work.
We need at at least hundred people in each of these five sectors.
Most of them, you would look at them, you would call it crazy.
And I think here, in the group of TED, many people are already working in these camps.
Bill Gross has several companies, among which a great great technologies in the solar technologies.
Vinod Khosla is investing in the dozens of companies that are doing great things and they have interesting, and I'm giving my support to all this.
Nathan Myhrvold and I are finding a company, and I are finding you will follow the road of nuclear
There were some innovations in branch the nuclear module, the nuclear nuclear nuclear state.
But from a good time, the sector is stop, that there are some good ideas around not so amazing.
And the idea of Three is that, instead of burning just part of the uranium, U235, the one percent of the urban uranio available, we decided to burn U238, 99 percent of the urban idea, in a sense.
The truth is about it for a long time, but it never had been adequately tried if it would work or not, the modern supercomputers today, you can do a simulation and see that it looks like this, with the right materials, it seems to work.
And because it looks at 99 percent of uranium, the structure of the urban structure of the best costs.
They burn the scories, and they use as a combuster of the reactors of the reactors of today, that they become the problem that they become a several resource.
It's a kind of a consumer as the combustation. It's a kind of chandela.
It's like a leap that burns.
From the view of the fuel of the combuster.
This is a picture of a place in Kentucky.
This is the shoe, 99 percent of the uranium, which was toldly now used as a combusty, and so it is called uranio poimpose urany.
This is a sculph would be energy to the United States for centuries.
And by filing the sea water, with a economic process, there would be enough fuel for the rest of life of this planet.
So, a lot of challenges us to it, but this is an example of the hundreds of ideas that we need to make progression of ideas that we need to make progression for progression of ideas that we need to make progression of ideas that we need to make progression of progredy.
How should we measure our progres?
What would they have to contain the pagel?
And then we provide the goal and then we value of the intermedia.
You've heard a lot of people talk about an 80 percent reduction for 2050, it's really important to get it.
20 percent will be produced by the poor and some of agriculture.
At that point, you hope -- we will have solved the deforestation and the production of the cement.
So to get to 80 percent, so the developed countries, including nations, including nations like China, will have to replace their electrical production.
The other question is: are we making this technology emission?
Do we actually put it in the development?
Are we spread?
It's an important aspect.
It's a key element of the pagelement.
Again, what would expect should have the pay of 20?
Even that should have the same two aspects --
We should be implementementing of efficiency to start getting reducing reductions.
Menemy we lose a total amount of CO2, and so the temperature.
But the vote in this material, do things that they don't really do large reductions, has only part, or even a part, or along, to the other, which is the speed of new inventions.
We have to push these progress all fast, and we can measure the speed from the number of businesses, projects -- modifies of ruling.
Many optics have been written about this.
Al Gore, "The Gore, "The chose," and that David McKay, "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air."
And these books deeply the problem and create a context in which I want to do the debate because these things need to have an spread use.
Most things have to have to be contemporary for.
So I have a wish,
A very concrete wish that we invent the technology needle.
If I had to choose only for the next 50 years, translate that the president of the country, the president of the country, the realization of a vaccine, which is not CO2, or I don't have to do this thing that costs the half and not CO2, I would have this last one.
It would be with the greatest impact.
If this wish, you won't make the fraction between thinks about the long-term thinks about the United States and China, between the United States and China, between the very very bad poor of those two billion people will be much worse.
What do we have to do, right?
What am I inviting you take the initiative and proceder?
We need a greater support.
When nations reunate in places like Copenhagen, they should not have to talk about CO2.
They should talk about innovation program, and you would stupid about how much unrewarding, and you might invest in these innovative approaches.
We need incenties, taxes on CO2, the chap and traded, instruments that evidence in the pollution.
We have to spread the message.
We have to make this more rational dialogue, and it must include the choices of the government of the government.
It's a commition, but I think we can do it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you. Just to know more on Earth's Earth's Earth.
first of all, can you give us an idea of the scale of investment?
Bill Gates: Realize the software, to buy the supercomputer, assuming all great scientists, what we've been done, it requires only tens of millions, and even when we tested the materials in a reactor, to be sure that they work at doverage, to be sure that they work to dovers, we're just going to talk about hundreds of millions.
The difficult thing is to build the plug reactor, finding billions, the place where the first example.
Once I built the first one, if it works, it will be the eggo of Colombo, because the constants, the density of energy, they're completely different from the nuclear that we know today.
CA: So, if I understand this implementementupon the construction of a vertical serbatoio filled with nuclear fuel fuel.
Then the process starts from the higher and progression to the bottom on?
BG: Right. The reactors, today, are reforming many people, many people who can not work, open and so many people, many controls that they can not work.
Not good!
If the combuster is very economic and you can make it past for 60 years and forgoats in and forgotten all those complexity.
He is brought for sex, and then it ends up.
CA: A nuclear employee that is about itself.
BG: Yeah. Well, you can leave there you can leave them, put them in another reactor and burn them in another reactor and burn them.
And we're going to start with the existing rewards of existing or cooling in the container or container in the container to the networkers.
They're going to be our first combusty.
So what it was a problem of conventional reactors will be the fuel of the known reflights will be reduced.
CA: But when I'm talking around the world of the potential of this technology, where you get most of this technology, where you interest with most of his realization?
BG: Well, there's no place in particular, and there are all these interesting rules of transparency of everything that is called nuclear -- so we rescue.
Our staff was in Russia, India, China.
I just met the Energia.
We talked about how this idea is adapted to the current program.
They're optimistic. France, Japanese and Japanese made of work in this field.
It's a variation about something that has already been done.
This is a reactor but it's a kind of reactor but it's a very fast of reactor, so many countries have already built a speed reactor is a good buger is a buger to accomplish ours.
CA: In your own advertises, what are the time and the probability that something like you do that?
BG: Well, for one of these projects scale -- producing energy, that doesn't cost, much energy, we talk about 20 years to design it and 20 years to design it.
This is the scadence that the environmental models.
Thirree if all the way, that doesn't ask is very much a question of it, it could easily easy this goal.
And now, fortunately, dozens of companies in the sector, that analogy, if their research works, if their functions, if they are fundamental plants.
And it's better if many solutions will have succeed, because at that points will reminate to a bunch of solutions.
We need to have at least one success.
CA: Parlighting of the important innovations, this is the biggest you know?
BG: A revolution is the most important.
It would be even without the environmental wine, but the environmental wines, but the environmental wines make it much more important.
In the rate of nuclear are innovators.
We don't know their job like this, but one is the modulare; a different approach.
There is a liquid reactor at the same thing. I think it's hard to do it, but perhaps they say the same thing.
So, there are funny fun, but the nice is that a molecule of urania, a million times more energy than a molecule, if you can managain than a molecule -- if you can run the negative effects of the environment, the potential, in terms of the environment, and it makes a classroom and other, it makes a classroom a classroom if you can be a classes if you can be a class of a molecule,
CA: And if it works, what do we do?
Wouldn't we be able to get emerging myself emergency to try and keep the Earth's temperature temperature?
BG: If you find you in that situation, it's a little bit like when you eat too much, and you are to have a heart attack.
Where do you go to that point? You could need a surgeon or something like this.
There is all research line, in geoengineering, which are various techniques that are various techniques that they would slow up 20 or 30 years in which to coordinate the action.
It's like to clear a polystage polish.
You're hoping not to get it.
Some of them say that you should not even work in the polizy because you could stay them and eat because you can keep eating because so much will be going to be health.
I don't think it's a choice, the importance of the problem, but now in the geoengineering of the geoengineering us if you want to take the solutions in the case where the event event or innovations come back later or innovations.
CA: Clima-scale -- if I had a sentence two, like you could persuaderthem that they hap it?
BG: Well, unfortunately, there are different types of skeptical skeptics are very few scientific --
Some people say there's a negative feedback because of clouds to clouds the effects of warming.
They're very, very few things that you can only say that there is one probability on one million that you can have a million that you have a million that you have the main problem looks like AIDS.
You put a mistake now and you pay the consequences only later.
And so, when you're taken from a thousand emergings, the idea to make sacrifices that you can just see the results that I just see the results of --
I sacrifice not very well-known away.
In fact, the IPPC is not the report of the IPC doesn't make the word; there are people in the rich world that looks at IPC and says, "OK, it's not the bad.
The fact is that that uncertainty should be to pushing us.
But my dream is that, if we can do it economically, and to respect the wins on CO2, then the skeptical skeptical skeptical that doesn't carry CO2, almost I would like an emittate because it's more economic technologies.
CA: Would you have this answer to the Bjorn Lomborg, that if you invent all the energy and try to solve the CO2, your other goals, your other goals, your goals, your other goals, would spread up when there are things to do, does that, when you have things to do like this?
BG: Well, the effect in research and developing --
We say that U.S.A should spend 10 billion as much as they do now not so much as they are now not so ingal.
It shouldn't distract resources.
The things that behaviors are very much money and here may have been reasonable to deal with the economic solutions.
For me it's overwhelming that.
Unless you are finding the curve, the curve, you get close to the point where it's going to become very economic effort that the efforts are focused in technological technologies that have the potential to absend the costs.
If the alternative, "We make the expensive energy, so that only the rich can afford," all of the present can afford," all of the present of life without changing.
The disaster would be for those two billion.
And the Lomborg has reviewed his positions.
His now "Why don't you talk about Ricer's longer and Sviluppo?"
And for his past still collects between the "skeptical," but I understood that is a bunch of the Ricer's and Switch.
And it's a question that I think it's appropriately to lift.
It's incredible how little investing you investigate in research and development.
CA: Well Bill, I think just about the most of the audience by saying that I hope to see your desire to become reality. Thank you.
BG: Thank you.
I want to share with you a discovered that I did some month ago when I was writing an article for Italian Wireview Wired.
I always have my own dictionary about my hand every time I write something, but I had already finished by the article and I realized that I never had in my life tried the word "disable" to see what I was going to find.
Let me read the result.
"Disable," age: Danneated, adjunated, adjury, unted, ranged, wily, stop, stop, stop, died Indebold, died Indebold, consuming, Senile, decret, Senile, decreeped by the circulation, painted by by the circulation, wild; wildy, wilding, wilty, unting, wiles.
Contrari: In form, strongly enough.
I was reading this high-voice list at a friend and at the begins to redeves, it was so ridiculous, but I had the word district, and I had to stop, and I had to stop, and I had to stopped off the shock and the impact that the top of these words have left me.
You know, we're talking about one of my old dictionary.
I'm thinking, it's going to be an old away.
But, I was the early 80s.
when I was starting in school, and I was forming and learning what there was from my family and learning what there was my family, and the world around me.
And I was useful to tell God I wasn't using using the dictionary.
I mean, from this explanation seems that I was born in a world that sees like one that has nothing positive in any way for them, when they are celebrate today, they are celebrated for the opportunities and the adventure that my life has approached.
So, I'm immediately going to see about 2009, in the network of the 2009, waiting me to find a revision without value.
This is the update version.
Unfortunately, it's not very better.
I find the last two words under "contrary." And in particularly uncomfortable and "health" and "health." So, it's not just about the words.
is what we think when we see them with these words.
is about the values behind these words, and how we build these values.
Our language influence our thinking and our vision of the world and how we see other people.
In fact, a lot of antic antic antic civilizations, including that Great and that Romana, they believed that it was more powerful, because they say things else, because they say things elevated.
So, what do we actually want to exist, one person who is limited, or an force?
So, casually doing something simple as to nominate a person, a child, we could put the taps and throw on their strength.
Would we don't like to open pores for them?
One person who opened my doctors, was the doctors of where I was the Dupton, Dupont in Wilmington, Delaware.
His name is Dr. Pizzle.
Italy, the U.S. which, which was too difficult to be able to take for most of the Americans, so it became a doctor P.
And the doctors had always fears fears and he had a perfect clink to work with children.
I loved anything about the time that I spent in the hospital with the existing of physical session of physix-session of physide.
I had to do what they seem infinite repetitions of exercise with these big elastic fases, in different colors -- you know, to help me build the muscles of legs.
And I hate these elastic elastic element.
I hate them, I got sick, really odid.
And you know, I knew already about a five years, with Dr. P to try to get from these exercizes, Inudged from these exercizes, Inually.
And one day, one of my seat, Stananananang and inesorables, these sites.
and she said, "wow, Aimee, you're a child, I think you go to row one of those phans.
"When you strompic you, I'm going to give you 100 dollar."
Now, clearly it was a little manufacty of a doctor to make me exercises that I didn't want to do with the perspective of being the richest child in the second piano, what he did did did was actually -- it was to give a different form to an horrible horrible routines.
and I turn it into an interesting experience for me.
And I am today that entity of his vision, and of his vision, and his deployment about me as a child, she redefined my vision of myself in a stronger and athletic athletics to person the future.
This is an example of how adults with power positions of power can infix the force of a child.
But, in the example of first with those definitions of the vocabulary of the synones, our language doesn't have the possibility of the reality of an individual see if the same as the able, the ability of an individual see if the same as the able, as you can see if the same as the able, you know, the ability of a vocabulary of the vocabulary of the vocabulary of the vocabulary of the vocabulary of the vocabulary of the vocabulary of the vocabulary of the
Our language, it wasn't in the past of changes our society, many of which have been created by the technology.
And of course, from a doctor, my legs, the operations to leave with their own left, knew, queen and also receive for the bodies that are helping people to cooperate with their skills, and you move over there of the skills that nature has impound, without lessentially implatforming the networkers to identify to identify people to description with each other.
So, perhaps technology will be revealing us much more what it was always a truth -- that each one has something to be rare and a little bit to our society, and the human ability to adapt is our greatest quality.
The human ability to adaptate it, is something interesting, because people have always wanted to talk about difficulty dealing of insornity and I have to love it.
This sentence has never gone to be good, and I always felt in the responding to people about this -- and I think I'm starting to understand why.
is underneath this sentence in this sentence, insorty, is the idea that the success, or happiness, is the idea that the other side of a challenge of a challenge that experience, if my life in life has come from a skiller is to save or surrounting the present of a life with protesis of slaving or what the present people like my disability.
But in fact, we have changed, we have changed, logiven by a challenge, physically or mentally both of them.
And I would suggest that it's a good thing.
The adversity is not an obstacle that we need to get to start our life.
is part of our life.
And I get to think that it's like my shadow.
On the time I notice a lot, and sometimes nearly for nothing, but it's always with me.
And, of course, I'm not trying to decrease the impact, the weight of a person.
There are adversities and the challenges in life, and it's all and relative to every single person, but the question is not if you had the beavversity or not, but as you go to to deal with.
So, our responsibility is not just to protect people to us from the adversity, but to prepare them to get them into the right way.
And we do a damage to our children when we feel that they're not ready to adapt.
There is an important important difference between the objective medical action of being an printing person and the subjective opinion of the society that will see me or not.
And in fact, the only disability consistent that I had to deal with is if the world has ever thought I could be describedded by those words.
In our wish desire to protect those that we love by giving them a fresh truth on their prognoys; really, the prognoysis of their lives of life expectancy of their life expectancy, we need to not put the first morning.
Maybe the existing model of looking only at what there's roof in and how to put it back to you, it can address more the subject that disease itself.
Not one person in the complete, not to understand his potentiality, we are creating another disease in the natural suffering.
We are actually giving a vote to the value of one person in our community.
So we have to see through diseases and the elements of human capacity.
and, much more importantly, there's a relationship between those insufficiency and our great creativity.
So, it's not to proposition, or negary, or negy, these numbers of research as something that we want to avoid or find under the carpet, but rather to find those opportunities to rack in an accident.
So, perhaps the idea I want to explain is that there is no thing that we have to explain it, to use a sense of free, to use a term of free, maybe even by using a term of free, maybe even dancing together.
And perhaps if we look at an accident like a natural thing and useful, we are less overwhelmed by his presence.
This year we celebrate the two-birthday of Charles Darwin, and it was 150 years ago, when I writing about evolution, that Darwin has illustrated, I think, the truth of the human character.
To tell it in another way, it's not the most strong of the speech that survives, and it's not even the smart, is the more you adapted to change.
The conflict is the genes:
Darwin, between other things, we can recognize that the human ability to survive and development is driven by the human spirit of the spirit human spirit through conflicts in transformation.
So, again, transformation, adapting, is our greatest quality.
And perhaps finally, we don't know what we are doed.
Maybe this is what it gives us adversity, a sense of the own.
So, we can do a given one gives us.
We can re-imagined adversity as something more than the harder.
Maybe we can see it as a change.
The adversity is a change, which we don't have adapted.
I think the biggest adversity that we have created is this idea of normal. Now, who is normal. Now, who is normal?
There is no normal, there is a type. There is a typical.
And would you want to meet those very gray people if there's be?
I don't think about it.
If we changed this paradigm from one on how to get the normality to one on the possibility, or potentiality, to be ahead a little bit more dangerous kids, and inviting them to joining their preptious capacities with community.
The anthropologists teach us that what we we, as humans, we always wanted to be helpful, to be able to contribute to it.
There is an evidence that in the Olland, 60 years ago, they brought the old and the subjects with gravity; perhaps thank you with graves and survival of these people were the value of the community of the community of the community of the commute, they were seen as a rare and value.
A few years ago, I was in a city market where I grew up in the northern of Pennsylvania.
and I was stood in front of a little bit of a pound.
I was summer and I had a bounds;
I heard this guy, his voice behind me and I was saying -- but it's not Aimee Mullins." And I flew up, and there's this man of a half.
And I said, "I'm sorry, we wouldn't have a god? I don't remember having a mea." He said, "You know, you don't remember having me.
I mean, when we met when we met you were born border."
Risate Oh, that guy.
And, of course, in fact, I was playing a camping.
That gentleman was the Dr. Kean, a man that I had only known by the stories of my mother on that day -- because of the typically, I got to retreat of two weeks.
And so, the knee quecologist of my mother had gone in vacations, so the man who had been hidden on my parents.
And because I was born without the lost and I had the shoot wide, some fingers in this feet, and some in that time, he had to be the messaggere, this extreme has to delived the bad news.
I said, "I've had to give this prognoysis of your parents that you wouldn't walk and you never walk and that you wouldn't be the kind of mobility that they have other children or no liver than any liver life or no liver than any life or no life that I had the extraordinary argument, which was that he said that he had a very remaintaining in the day, a conversation that I had a conversation between all my childhood, a conversation of the words, a concerned.
that I had to go to the Girl Scout, you know, Hallowe'd won my study, or all my studie, or all my lawise, and I won it, and he used them, and he used them, and he used it, and he was using it, by the study medicine schools of Haheneneman of Haheneneman and Hershey.
And he called this part of the Grow; the potentiality of the human will,
No prognosis can keep in how pose pose it can be and determining the quality of life in a person.
And the doctor, Kean was going to explain and he said, "Not my experience, unless you repeated, and even though it is gives us a bunch of support, if you just leave to itself, one child came to it."
You see, Dr. Kean changed his opinion change.
I understood there's a difference between a medical condition, and what each one can do with it.
And there's been a change in my thinking about the years, in this if you were asked when I was about 15 years, if I had exchanged by carne and bones, I wouldn't exitate a second.
I was all that kind of normality at that time.
If you ask it today, I'm not sure about it.
And it's because of the experiences I had with them, not for the experiences that I had with them.
And the change in me was because I was exposed to the people who opened me the door of the people who opened me.
You see, everything you need is a person that you need is a person that shows you the epiphania, and you're started. If you can give someone someone someone who's clocked their forces, the human spirit is so wealth, if you can do it, and open a door for someone in a crucial moment, you are trained in the best ways.
You're teaching them to open the doors.
In fact, the exact meaning of the education is from the root of the word "to extract the potential that means, to pull the potential.
So again, what is the potential that we want to pull out of it?
There was a study in the '60s in Grand short when they were stepped from the schools.
This is called the proof the continuity; we call it "ling" here in the United States.
It means to separate students dependently by their you.
And the students with the best voices have a more harder program, and teachers a better teachers -- they did it for a three months, well, they did it for a three months. The students who said they were good for the options. The said they were good at their options.
And at the end of this period of three months, they were having the results of the optime." And clearly, clearly, the sad of this studio, and who took students from "Too students to say, "Ot." And that's what happened at the end of three months.
The ones that were in school, over and over the ones that I had leaved.
The crucial part of this study was that the teachers were also Environments.
The teachers didn't know that it was done this change.
The was just said simple. These are the very good students and these are the people with insufficient.
And that's how they started to teach them.
So, I think the real disability is to have a damaged spirit and a damaged spirit doesn't have hope.
Don't see the beauty.
It has no natural, infantile curiosity and our innate capacity.
If you age, we can support the human spirit to keep the hope, to see the beauty of beauty in if you are using our correct and others, to be imaginative and we are using our correctly.
When the spirit has these quality, we can create new realities and new ways of it.
I want to leave you with a poem written by a poet-performance,
and the poem is called the dio that he knows only four words and say, "On God, not the God of NO, not the God dio of NO, but the God dio of the NO, but the God knows four words and continues to repeat with me.
Thank you.
