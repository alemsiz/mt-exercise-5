Last year I showed these slides to demonstrate that the glacial calote, which is almost three million years of the size of the 48 United States of the size of 48 United States continental and a 40-year-old level.
But this underpuses the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice because it doesn't explain the ice.
The artic calottics, in a sense, the clear heart custome of the global climate system.
It expand it reverse and you return it into extinct.
The next device, it will be a rapid carrying the saviment of the last 25 years.
The eyes are lost of them are signed in red red red by the red red of the red around.
As you see, they expand they expand it sweet up to the scuro.
That's the ice in the invernal inversus of summer.
You can see the cosident cosidential cosident -- it's like blood and that's like blood here and smoking, which is from the body.
In 25 years is spent from this,
This is a problem because the re-scale of the ice of the ice around the ocean around around the ocean artical amount of carbon on that allow carbon and allow that allow carbon on microbes.
It really, to the totality of the atmosphere, global warming, that amount could double, super-scale of this is not report.
In some deep lages in Alaska methan is already already taken from water.
The professorse professoral Katey Walter of Alaska team was rected with a team belelt land,
Video: Wow! Gor: She is good. The question is if we're also going to be it.
A reason is that this is that this exchange from the Groenland,
This is a glacial fighting physical fires.
The portraised never reached levels.
This is the Kangerlussuaq, in the southwest of Groenland of Groenland of Groenland of the Groenland of the Groenland of the Groenland of the Groenland of the Groenland of the Groenland of Groenland Groenluse.
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea ice of the sea ice on earth out of the ground, that's where the sea.
These currents are increasing very quickly.
Antarctical of the planet: Antarctical block of the planet.
The month scientists have degree that the ice of the ice is in negative, and the Antarctical Western and the Antarctical on some of the underwater on some of the islands is particularly faster in money.
Equival six feet of water, like in Groenland, like Groenlying.
South Himalaya, the third biggest block of ice -- you see new laghi, and they were glaciers.
40 percent of the world's population reach half of the pounds of the pounds of the monkey.
Andelle Ande: This ice is the bottom of the water water water from this city.
The portrained is increased.
But when he dimineer, the same thing happens, the same thing happens.
In California neve on the Sierra Nevada is 40-percent.
The hydrodrogen are in the crisis.
The previsions, as you know, they're several with it.
The growing growing in the world door a remarkable remarkable of the incencies.
The environmental disaster is increasing a rerited out of normal and previous conversation.
Four more numbers than the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the previous previous previous previous for the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the previous of the last 30 years of the previous previous previous previous precedents.
This is a gone of the whole whole thing.
If you look at the historical context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years, we add 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the Science of Pacific, from Americh, and the Americh, and on both of the subcontinent -- where there's a radical radical right, where there's an impoor in the ocean oxygen in the ocean oxygene in the ocean oxygene in the ocean countries.
The greatest cause, global warming, and the global warming, which is 20, it's the use of fossil fuels of fossil fuels.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse worst st of it.
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions, with the China.
And they proposed to build a lot of carbon and carbon on on carbon on and carbon on and put it on a lot of carbon and build a lot of carbon and coal of coal.
But we're assisting a direction.
These are the analysswed in the last few years and some evidence of the versus of the versus of the last few years and some eviles.
Anyway, there's a political lotta in our country in our country
The carbon industry and oil industry have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon on the carbon on on the carbon and oil.
That image I remember something --
Natal, Natal, in Tennessee, where I lived there was a perssweet of carbon dishes.
Maybe you saw it on the news of the news
This is the second biggest flush in America.
It happened around Natal.
The carbon diverage of carbon industry was this.
Video: Frosty the carbon is a kind of hallegrand happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is more and cleaner and cleaner and cleaner and cleaner.
It's good price, adorable and adorable and their work workers are doing it.
Al Gore: From a lot of carbon of the West Virginia.

For this is to invest a great amount of money in a lot of money in a better better money, to make public and conuse the truth and conuse the truth and conuse the truth of carbon on and conuse the truth and conuse the truth and conuse the truth of the priority is to invest in a public re
In fact, carbon is not sport.
We think it's clean -- it has a good profume.
So not predictable to climate change.
Let me do it.
Video: Attore: Carbone -- you've heard a lot of it.
So let's do this a structure around a structure of the structure of carbon as a carbon as a carbon as a carbon as a carbon as a carbon as a structure of the carbon as a coal coal as it as a carbon as a carbon as a carbon as a carbon as a carbon as a carbon as
Straordinary cars are a little row! The machine are a little bit of coal carbon technology.
The carbon is between the main the main causes of global warming, but the notice technology of carbon clean that you can see change.
To a eye -- this is the odierce of carbon coal technology.
Al Gore: Infind, the positive alternative alternative to the economic economic and the national security and the national security.
Video: Comment: Americis in crisi; the national economy, the national security crisis.

Now, yet, there's a new new solution for ushes.
Repower -- 100 percent of clean energy in 10 years.
A plan to reput the America to work, make us several and help us to help us to reach the global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
Real America. Scover more

We have to go far far fast.
Thank you very much.
LHC. I got a introduction on LHC.
And I promise to go back to you back to how the machine.
So there I was no one of the other time there isn't it, LHC is the biggest scientific experiment, and the most scientific experiment, or 17-foot circle.
His the compit is to reach the conditions that were less than a billion of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
And that's just the tune.
This is the machine under Ginevra.
We Fotographic these min-Big Bang into the relevel of detectors.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's largege-foot and a diameteter of 2,000 feet and 2,000 feet of 2,000 feet and a diamet-meters.
This is an ATLATLATLATLAS in built so you can see the proportions.
The 10 secember of the last year we have accepted the machine for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLA.
It was because of immense in the room in the room of control.
It's a first image of the first fashion particles that had done all the LHC, entering with a part of LHC, and deliberately, with a particles of the LHC, and spreading particles inside the retail.
In other words, when we saw that image the 10 sector, we realized that the car works, the machine that is a great living.
I don't know if it was going to exact more or that, when somebody went on Google and vide that the beginning was going to be on Google and the beginning.
That means we have had a cultural impact beyond in scientific ways.
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, because right right to these files here -- these files dors.
These files bring 13,000 prints when the machine works at the massive manuface.
Now, the technical of you will look at the movies and say, "It's not true. It's not true. It's not true.
And they can do it because when they're very freezing the superconductors.
So, at least 271 degrees to a inference between the stars, these files can bring that current to the current of the space between the stars, and they can bring that current to the current temperature to that current the space between the stars, and they can bring that currently the stopping temperature to the current of the space between the stars, and they can bring that current the current of the space, between the stelles, these filmmming temperature between the space,
In one of the junges between the most of the GGGl, there was a deft of the retail factory.
So the files surprised and 13,000 feet of suddenly meet a electrical resistance to meet a resistance resistance and they were all meet a resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is still more impressive if you think that these magnets, the fish of 20 tons of 20 tons of 20 centimeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take it to leaving them, what we did it.
We have repristined and enjoy and enjoy
Now they're reporting all of their underground.
By the end of the LHC will be new intea.
And we would like it and we expect to get the right right or him, and continue and continue and continue that we are the morning to discovering what are the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain quest of the way, these crashes reaccending the debate of science and engineering the science and engineering to confut. It's easy.
I think that the fact that it's so hard, the fact that you go beyons, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I want to end with the words of a scientist Inglese, Humphrey Davy, the guy, you know, image, image, in defense of his puzzle was Michael Faradaday, and said, "No is that it's not that dangerous for the human mind as the requid as the red, as the red, and the requid of human mind that we don't have to nature that are completely mysterious to nature, and that are not not not mysterious to confifive."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you about how to rethink about how to get cooking cooking coos.
As you can get them and get them and to make them and move them and move them and move it and to get them and solve problems and sold and sold and sold relationships, and so to think and sold and a space relationships.
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us.
So, from an informath inspired by the useful of our physical interaction with physical objects and my Jeevan Kalanithi, and I started asking -- I started asking -- and I started asking -- and if we use a computer, instead of having the only a computer crossing polyred, we can get a digital construction of information to required the information to the physical sical hands, we can get a information with a information with a information to the reversus of the fundamental consultant,
and we get it to our pleasure about?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, built the answer, built Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable is a Siftable computer.
In a few words, a Siftable is a Siftable computer.
You can see them with the handle -- they can see it out of their motion, and they feel their movement and a radio wireless and a radio wireless radio wireless to it.
But most of them are physical objects like the morning morning, you can just move to it just by the morning --
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem for a new ecosystem information.
And as they get more physics, you know, consciouss, and as they are hand as they get more physics, and as they get more physics, and they get more physics, and how we move to them and new and fundamental and different interaction.
I started with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show the vide: if you win a direction, the video rooters like this, if you win the other hand, if you wrote from the other hands back.
These interactive interactive reportrates are others.
If they are interested in it, you are interested in what they int.
If they come up and they can get a little bit and they can get a little bit of it.
If they come up and they can get a little bit and they can get a little bit of it.
They also have their movement and including them and including it.
We then realized that one of the interesting interesting interaction was able to use community community to use community community to say, "vers" a color as if it was a colord.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as a drink and I can use them to the color of the color in the central that they mix it.
and I can use them to the color in the central that central color, where they mix miles.
If we are too good -- we can put a little bit of it.
There are also good possibilities of apprinting as langues, the mathematics and mathematics and sea games of the things that and see the results of the things and see the results of the results.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonaces that I do with a equation's program of equations.
Here we have a words of words that is half between Scareo and Boggle.
On every turns, every turning a literal literal literal literally on every Siftable, Prrying, and every turns, and as you try to get a table, and when you try to get words about a dictionary to a dictionary about a dictionary to a dictionary about a dictionary to a dictionary in every turning of the savailable to
And then after about 30 seconds remissed and you a new set of bears and new possibility to try and new possibility to try to be able to try to read.
Thank you.
Here's what the kids came to the Middle Lab, I did it in a way that they tried them and I took a video video.
They are pleased a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things that I have to do it is that you don't have to give you a lot of educations.
You just have to say, "Compy" and they know exactly what to do.
Here's how other people that try it.
This is our youngest beta youngest tester there on the street.
It really wanted to be employees.
They were only morning, for him.
Now, this is an interactive of a interactive careon.
We wanted to build a tool for the apprinting of the English law is Felix.
It can be new characters in the scene, solliant to the Siftable to their listening to the new characters.
It can be new characters in the scene, solliant to the Siftable to their listening to the new characters.
And that's what the sold.
Video: The only is surging.
David Merrill: Now it brought a treatment in the scene.
Video: The treatment treatment.
Bel work!
So schooling the Siftable and put them close to interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
and inventing their story.
Video: Ho!
DM: It's a story with the open final final final of the wind --
DM: It's a story with the open final final final of the wind --
Video: Golden -- gat.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, made of recently recently -- to sample, to sample, and execected to the music.
It's a tool, made of recently, to sample, to sample, and execution.
Siftable here are acting by sounds like base, based and bacteria --
Every one of these four different variations, and you can choose what you can use it.
You can put these sounds on a sequence to get to your pleasure to your pleasure to your pleasure and life;
And I will just show you just just touch a sound" and a "sequence."
These are actually actually that you can control from living as the reversus and films.
And you attach to a particular sound sounds to upward it.
And then there are the effects of the effect, and they are applied to the inter-sequence.
Let's look like this.
Video: DM: We're going to start with a basic in two Siftable to sequences, we go to a serie, the extreme other basis.
Now I put a bunch line.
Video: DM: Now addition of percent use --
Video: And I'm going to put the filtrum, so I can control the mobile philan; so I can control the effect of the live.
Video: I can speak the entire sequence with a lining time from a side or from the other.
Video: And I'm going to add the filter to the bottom of getting more expression.
Video: I can recombined the sequence ""Les."
So I don't have to planning the first one, but I can sudden, it sounds longer or more corner.
And now, finally, I can go the whole sequence the whole sequence on the left of the Siftable to the entire Siftable to the entire Redge the entire sequence with the left of the entire sequence and the whole thing is the Siftable to the entire sequence with the Siftable to the entire sequence the Siftable to the whole sequence and the finally, I can be able to leave the whole sequence the whole sequence of the mail
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces of man-machine is more and more and corporate and corporate and corporate it.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this lost and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab to bring out of the lab of the lab and a few chance of this lost and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of this lost and a few possibilities that we try to bring out of this lose and we try to get out of this lost and get out of this lost and we try to get out of this
The concept I want to transmit is that it's coming this new generation of things that are designed to interact with digital media media in our world in the way we want to get information in our world in the way we want to transforming information in our world that we want to transmit you to transform with digital digital media is that we want to transform with digital digital media in the world that we want to transform with digital information in our world
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time about this with all of you.
They're a writer.
And I want to get books is my professional extracted but it's more than that, of course, of course,
It's also love and the fall and the fall of my life.
And I don't expect to be changing.
But, I said that something particularly happened in my life and in my life and in my life and I brought me to recept the entire relationship with this work.
The particular thing is that I recently recently wrote this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Prega, which is a great deal previous prisons, for some reasonable of my books, for some reasonable of the world and become a great deal with a big interactional conational.
And the result is that everywhere you go to me as if I was condnury.
It is true -- condannated, conddnatel!
They go from me to me all worried and said, "You don't have fear to do not get to do it?
You don't have to keep writing for all the life without that you could be able to create a book that can importing somebody?"
that would be important to somebody?"
It's rassics, you know,
But it could go worse and worse that I remember that I was about 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I was a write -- I wanted to be a writer.
I would go to the same based on the same fear.
And people said, "Don't you teme not the teme of having success?
You don't have a fear that the refire of refire you kill?
You don't have to do this mestiate for all life without that anything that is ever outside and die on a cool of same, with the multi-hen-hands with the mouthetic haming energy,
So he knows that.
The answer -- the short response to all these questions is: "You know, I said, "Yes."
I papers of all of things happens.
I always had a land.
And I also have a lot of other things that people could not initiate it.
As the allow and other things sheep things.
But, as I write what I thought I was thinking and ask me a lot of question, because it's it?
Is it rational?
It's logical that anyone who should be spend a job that you feel about being a job that you feel about it.
But what is there so particularly in the imprese creative to make us nervvous health of the mine in a way that other career to not fanno?
As my father, he was a chemistry, and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity that he was asked if he was asked if they were asked if they were able to be engineer with a chapp to engineer it?
It was never -- that block of the engineer as a voting do?
It wasn't working on this, right?
Only, chemistry, chemical engineers as they don't have certainly reputation to be alcouraged the reputation of being alcouraged by depressive depressive depressive.
We write and writers have enough this reputation, and not only writers but creatives of every general, we have this reputation of being enormously instable to be enormously instable to be enormously instable to be enormously instable to be enormous.
And it's not another one that look at the tristage of the magnificent of the magnificent of the magnificent of the magnificent of the magnificent of the magnificent of the magnificent of the magnitude that are often to them.
And even those who don't have to be really, they look at being disperformed by their dones.
Norman Mailer, before I did, in the last interview said, "Ogngn, my book book has been killed a little bit more than the job of their own life.
But we don't drink when we feel like to say because we heard these things so much long, and we have completely interized and acceptioned the notion that creativity and suffering are somehow you wood, and the art, and the art, and the art, and the art, and the art, and the art, and the art, and the art, and the art, and the art, and the end, and suffering are always going to go to the enjoy
And the question I want to ask all of the way is is that I agree with this idea?
It's good for this thing -- because it also looks at a centimeter of distance to me not for this supposition.
I think it's odied.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great minds creative mind.
And I certainly know that in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start out to commodities, especially the constitude that are in my career.
And it is really a lot of you know, I'm pretty young and I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very likely that anyone what I write is going to be right from the world as the work that used after the work that was going to be right after my last book.
He was slavery, because we're all over or less friends here -- is likely to my greatest -- it's likely to my smooth --
Oh, Gesus --
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start to start drinking gone in the morning and I don't want to do it.
I would pretend to keep doing this work that we do.
So, the question becomes go?
And so I would seed me after a lot of reflection that the way to work and write is to create a psychological costructure, right?
I have to have a few way to find a safety distance between me, that I am write and my natural natural -- which is what it written for everything that written for everything I started looking for all over the last year I started looking through time, trying to find other society to see if they could be able and more healthy and more healthy to see if they could be able and healthcare care care of them and more health and more blood and more health and more health and more healthcare and more and more healthy and
as to help people create the people who are emotional inerents of creativity.
And that research me to the Greek and ancient Romomome and ancient Romomom.
Seguitemes because it gives in circle and then back back.
In the Greek and Rome anticics, people didn't look at creativity that creativity came to humans, OK?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit and that they came to be degrees and that came from a few surprising surprising and unknown away.
The green were called these spirits of the creativity of creativity "demony."
Socrry, wonderful creating to have a demone that elargively.
Romans were the same idea, but they were called that kind of spirit without a genius
The one is great, because the Romans didn't really think that a genius was a genius to be a particularly intelligence --
They thought that a genius was this sort of divine that was actually actually in the study of study a little bit like an article of an artist, a little bit like the elfe Dobby, and who came out to assister the job of the article and modeling the result of that work.
Ecceptional -- -- -- -- that is the distance of which parts -- that construct costruct of psychological that protects you and the result of your work.
And they all knew that was so that it was so that it was so doing it?
So the antic artists were protons of things like this, as for example too narciss; you know?
If your work was exceptional doesn't have to take it all the degree all of the deal with this incorporea.
If your fail, it wasn't all of the skill, right?
They all knew that was your genius to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inabout.
And so the people han concept that creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then the Rindication came and everything changed and nact, and we put this on the center of the universe between the middle and the mysters and no more to leave space creatures that write is details that write detail.
This was the most rational of human respective, and people started thinking that creativity to think that creativity is completely from the idivid.
And for the first time in the story, you start to reference that artist as a genius as a genius as a genius to a person with genius to a person with genius to a person.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big mistake.
I think I can allow somebody, a simple person to believe that being a reciplement as a recipe and the surprising and the surprising myths is a very much of the fragile and etherases is a very much of deal to the fragile fragile smokly to the fragile of the human beings.
It's like to ask someone to ingoid the sole.
It degrees and distores all these ingestyle, and it creates all these ingestyles on the lose and force
And I think it was this pressure that we destruct the artists in the past-year-old artists in the past-year-old artists in the past-year-old artists in the past-year-old artists in the past.
And if this is true, and I think that it is, and you?
Can we do it different?
You know, you go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery creativity.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't get 500 years of rational thinking about 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes.
And there is people in the audience that would solliant stage of scientific suspects on the notion of the notion of the undary -- you know, folks on their projects.
I probably won't convince you all about this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- because it's it?
Why don't you think about this this way?
Because it has more sense of any other thing that has ever heard to explain the exhihibition of the creative process.
One thing that you ever have ever attempt to do something -- so fundamentally, all here -- it doesn't be rational; it's not remarkable to be rationality.
And in fact, it can sometimes be completely paranormal.
I did this recently recently with the extraordinary poetc. And I did that was now 90 years, but that was a poet-year-old poet-old infected in the Virginian Virginia, worked out in the camps, and I felt it was out in the field, and I felt it from the landscape.
And he said it was like a fragorous train the air.
And he came to roll out of her landscape.
And he was going to get it to get the land below its feet.
He knew that point and it was doing that point and it was words like a morning -- "current."
And so it was going to go to home and came home and it would not have to get a piece of paper and a bad enough to take a piece of paper and a pretty freezing enough and the translate and it it will be on the page.
Sometimes it didn't be quite quite quickly, so it was so correct and correct and correct it was able to get to the home and the poetry and she was allowed to roll and she was going to stay through the landscape, and she was going to roll up through the landscape, and he said, "Why."
And then there were -- this piece of not forget it -- there was no time -- there were almost lost beard, right?
So, she was running up and he was trying to card and the poetry and it was a math right in the while he was getting a match of the hand and and he was like, he was like to the other hand the off.
And he was offered the poem of coda and the reports in his body and translate it into the page.
And in these cases, the poetry is going to be presented on the perfect page, but at the last word at the top of the last worst at the first one of the last word.
So when I felt I feel -- it's a crazy -- it's exactly the equal of my creative process.
Not all my creative process. I'm not a conditional condomit!
I'm a mulation, and my way to work is -- I sweet me to go to the same orary every day and go to the deal and go to the wide, and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go to the same thing is and go to the same order, and you can get it up and go up and go up and go to the deep and and go to the depend on the same orary and go to the sweet and go up and go to the over and go to the swear and go to the detech up
But even I stand in my head -- I was stroke up against that thing, and I was going to be able to you.
And I imagine that many of you have the han done.
You know, even if I work and the ideas came to me from a certain source, I couldn't honestly know.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to it in a way to not lose us to lose the head -- but pluttning, what do we do to remain sanimal to be able to remain them?
For how much it really, the best example of me that I have is the Tom Waits, which I interview, I interview, I interviewed a journeal.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the major life was the incarnation of the artical article of the argument -- to engage these species of implemented to control these kind of recreatives of implemented really, interiorized.
But then I agreed it, and a day as she was driving on a day, and a day and he was changed on a car to Los Angeles, changed everything for him.
It was going to be very fast, and all a little bit of this little framework of melodia, which comes into his head as it makes the inspiration, eluses you and had, you know, it's wonderful, and you know, it's wonderful, but it doesn't know how to take it.
It doesn't have a piece of paper, it doesn't have a match of a match of a match of card.
So it starts to hear this sort of old anxide to be to be in him and remarruse, and remarrying baby brought up with this lost son.
I don't get enough and I can't do it."
And instead of go to the skin, he stopped it.
And he was going to do the entire process and did something completely new thing.
And he just looked at the sky and said, "You know, I don't see that I'm driving it?
"Do you look like that it can write a song, song, song.
If you really want to exist, you go back to a more opport, when I can take care of you.
Something I came to a few more today,
I wanted to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his work changed after that.
Not the work was even dark as it was even dark as it was even even even the work of it.
But the process of the fishing fishing was released when I previous was released when the genius the genius came from from from the other problems and free and free it remaining it was not to be a whole thing.
but he knows this peculiar bizard, wonderful bizarre a conversation between Tom. And this strange and outside that he was not going to be Tom.
So how much the story that I was going to change a little bit that I was working and already rescued a time.
This idea, I rescued when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Ama," and falls in one of the disperation that we all when we are working on something and we don't start thinking that is going to be a dest -- and we don't start thinking that it's going to be a worst book that that is going to be the worst book that is never writed.
Not just bad for the worst written written -- I written to it.
And I started thinking about to throw this project.
But then I remember Tom talked to the air and try and try it.
So I came up with my face on the hands of the sent and direct my comments to a corner of the room.
And I said, "You know, what, and what, you know, I mean, you know, I don't know that if this book is not going to be brilliant to myself?
Because as I see that I'm going to put all of that I have, I don't have to do that.
So if you want to get you to introduce you and do your parts.
OK, but if you don't do it, you know, I don't know what, I don't know what it is.
I'm going to go to write the same because it's my work.
And I want to favor that was recorded that I have been presented to do my part," because -- at the end is like this, OK -- sites in the North Africa is in the North Africa people were reaching for dance, and music and music and music and music and music and music and the sacred to the tree to the treatment and the heal to the treatment and the heal albe.
And they were always magnificent because the drugs were professionalers and fantastic and were fantastic and fantastic and fantastic and were fantastic and fantastic and fantastic.
But every tant, I would make something happen, and one of these artists become transmitugly translend.
And I know what I talk about, because I know that you all of it, and a certain point, a lost point, a lost of it.
It was like the time is stopping and the drug walked through a kind of portal portal portable and was not doing anything from the sun, but all of the 1,000 night, but all of the time.
And suddenly not only as a human as a human being.
But it turns out out of divince and fall in the devast of divinity.
And when this next themy; you know, the themy; they were called him with his name.
They were the hands and started to meant to be a cant, "Allah, God God, God God, God, God, God, God.
That's God, you know.
Curious name, when the More invaser the Spaper is the Spaper per -- they would have this abitude and the ready ready to be able to be able to be in the century of "Allh" in the bounds' remains.
In Spay when a artist has done something impossible and magic -- "Allah, magnifi, you know, fleavoid -- you know, a flew -- a last -- a last last of God.
And it's greatly big.
But, the problem comes up the ballery -- when you go and you get it and find that they are the 9/11, and the Dr. Martedny and last of God is not morning morning, there's no more.
It's just a great dead with a great male with a lot of male to each other, and maybe not will be able to get to that altea.
And maybe nobody will be the name of God still as the yet of his light, so what has to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most pain orose sweeping to make a creative life --
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angoches if you can not believe it, but that the most extraordinary aspects of your being being from you to stessi.
But it just creates that I'm going to be data in a indicable to you have to have to get a little bit of your life that you have to get someone else to get anybody else that you have finished.
And you know, if we think in this way it change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's certainly as I thought for different months during the work of the book that public public I will have been doing the dangerous -- and I was very excited about my great-scale followed my great-great-scale of my great-great-scale of my great-scale --
And what I have to keep saying when I feel electried to me when I feel elemented from this is, not land.
Not just just your work.
It will be presenting for your parts, any of your hand, any of them to be there.
If your work is dance, bally.
If the divin, I assurd, I assigned it decides to leave a few kinds of wonderful wonderful for a moment through your sants for a long time through your sants --
Something to the same thing.
And "Ok!" to you know,
I think I think it's dealing with it.
"Ok!" to you know, even though only for human and tests and tests that are doing it all the talks to be going to depresent it continuously.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As I know I've talked about some of these projects on the genome of the human genome and discovered new set of genes.
We're now starting a new percorrect -- we started digitalize biology and now starting to get from that digital code and now we're going to get into a new fashion biology, designing and savetizing life.
We always tried to make great questions.
"What is the life?" is something that many biologists I think have tried to understand var vars of levels.
We tried different approaches, reducing minimes to minimes to minimes of ters.
We're digitalizing for almost 20 years now.
When we sequenced the human genome was treating of the world of biology to the world of biology to the digital world of the computer.
Now we ask ourselves to the life, or create new life from this digital universe from this digital universe from this digital universe as a digital universe as we can regenerate life from this digital universe to digital life from this digital universe from this digital universe from this digital universe from this digital universe from this digital universe of this digital to this digit
This is the map of a small organism -- the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the gene of the smallest genome of those that can authored in the lab in the lab of the lab of the legenitalium, which is the genitalium, which is the genititalium, which is the genititalium,
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more smaller than that.
We can get a gene centinaie a gene of genes about 500 of the genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the metabolic map on the metabolic map to the nostrength.
I think, is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate a time, it's very unlikely that this can bring a cellula to a live.
So we decided that the only way to progression was synthesize this chromosome, so we can get the components to make the components to make the fundamental components to some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the wind of "Can we can synthesize a chromostly a chromostly chromostly of "Can we can synthesizing a chromomostly of the "Can we can synthesize a chromostly a chromostly chromostly to the
Can you make it conservation to produce these great molecules that never have to do the earliest to create before they haven't able to do the ear?
And in case it really, we can make a chromosoma?
A chromosome, it's just a chemical piece of chemistry.
The speed with which we are able to digitalize life is growing up to exponential life is growing up to exponential life is growing up to exponential life is growing up to exponential life is growing up to exponential life is growing up to exponential life is growing to exponential life is growing
Our ability to write the genetic code code code and rather than slowly, but it's improvement.
And our most recently, the results of the leading on a curve curve on a curve curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of the past revision before we started with a bioetic revision before we started the early experiments.
But we discovered that DNA is very difficult.
There are decades of thousands of cars in the world that make little segment little segment of 30 to 50 bear and it's a degenerative process -- the more segment is longer than the segment is longer than the segment is longer than it is.
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these frames and correct the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt to starting to start from Phi of the genome of Phi 174.
It's a little virus that kills bacteria.
We designed the framments, effectively the report of the mistakers and get a molecules of DNA of about 5,000 letter letter of DNA letter
The interesting part is when we took this chemical chemistry material material and we put it in the bacteria started to read this genetic code and deal with this genetic code and to prove particles and produce the virals.
The virals have been released by the cell phone, they go back and they have destroy E.
I talked about recent with members of the petrolifestyle, they were saying that they certainly understood this model.
They have more than you.
We think this is a situation where the software can really build its own own the same hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the biggest things in greater
We wanted to build the entire chromosome.
They're over 580 mile les,
So we thought we could build it in the bottom-up up the size of virus, so that we can change the components to understand what the components of a vid.
The projection is crucial and if we start with digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the standard accurategy of a mistake for every 10 mibasis.
We have been discovered, 30 mistakes. If we used that original sequence that original sequence we never used that we could never be able to do it.
A part of the process is to design sitting 50 letters that are getting over 50 letters that are all the other segment to 50 letters to build undergrounity to build underground underground underground underground underground with all the other segment to work together.
We try to try to put it here.
You probably have a bed that we insert us of the big.
Think of it is: We have a genetic code on four litere: A genetic code and T.
Tree of those letters together codifice about 20 adminious adminimal adminious orders, and there's a specific order to bear with every friend.
So we can use genetic code to write words, fraise and do it.
What we did at the beginning was authography.
Some were dolphins from the fact that it was not poems.
We designed these sitting these segments to just start with a feet.
There are enzyme that reparent and put them up and put them up and put them up and assumption.
And we started to start with stars, starting with five to seven miles on four miles in a way to make a thousand literally to 24 miles, and to put them up to 72 miles, to get to 72 literally.
On every step we made these sitting in abundance so that we are trying to make a remarkable to create a receptional except to create a very robate proceed-to-to-scale.
We're trying to automatizy the process.
So, this seems the tabellone of a basket.
When we get to these very long segment, more than 100 midragges are not going to grow up in E.
You get to the modern of molecule.
So we have considered other mechanism.
We knew another mechanism called recombination recombination called recombination recombination of DNA to reparate DNA to reparate DNA to unique the DNA to unize the DNA to unique the segments.
Here's an example.
This organisms, called Deinococcus radioving three million radiations.
You can see in the sound square in the grown as his tails is destroy to destroy in the ground.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be complete complete complete complete complete complete complete complete complete complete complete complete complete it.
They can live under empty beat.
They're absolutely certainly certainly in space, and you get a new remarkable environments to find new rich environments of water.
NASA showed that this is that this happening out.
This is a molecule is a molecule of molecules that we built using the trial design approach, just using the design of segment to inserious design of segments to inserious design of the molecule.
The light-re-cared automatically.
This is not been taken with a electric microscope -- but with a microscope of rule.
It's a molecules that we can see it with a microscope of law microscope.
These are pictures that cover a period,
This is the advertitient that we did a little time ago.
They're over 580,000 letters of genetic code of genetic code code --
It's the biggest molecule of a structure that ever created by the man.
It has a lot of 300 million a lot of 300 million.
If we were going to go with a 10 without spaces, you would like 142 pays, you just want to get this genetic code this genetic code only genetic code to this genetic code this genetic code this genetic code only to get this genetic code to get this genetic code this genetic code of the 10 paper per and transfer to
Now, how do we do it? How do we make it work?
Obviously, you get a virus is a game of boys.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria.
It's simplest as it is a simple simple cells like ourselves, you can just extreme the nuclear and inserirl one other, which is basically the process of clonation.
In the bacterium is the chromosome, it's integrated inside the cell phone, but we have recently showed that we can do a birthday of a cell chromosome, and the other and activity to the other and activity to another and activity it.
We could refit a partnership from a microbial chromosome.
The two are different as the tunes of the topi.
We add some kind of more in a way that we can decide that chromosoon.
And then it has the sciency with the enzyme with all the protects of the proteins.
And when we put it in the cellula is stupend -- and you will open our graphic degree of the new smosome, the new is going to go inside the cell phone.
And we were really thinking that we couldn't go down there, but we tried to get it more than we could get more in there.
This is one of the greatest mechanisms of evolution.
We discovered that a second species have added a second or a third of a third of a third of a new new new trates.
So who think about evolution as a gene only as a gene gene that it doesn't have a lot of the biologists that is not a lot of the biologists as a gene of biology.
There are no enzymes called restripes of restripes is that adult to the DNA.
The romosomes that was in the cellula doesn't have one.
The mobile pha-tail-tail-tail.
And it is expressed, and it recognized the other chromosomes as an extrane," and we were refined with only the cellula and the new cool.
It became blue because of genes we inserved.
And in a short time, all the characteristics of a species have gone in a little bit of lost software are that we put in in a new software that we insert in a new software that we inserted in the cell phone.
All the proteins are changed, membranes are changed, and when we read the genetic code code as well as we have transfed.
Now, this may look at genetic alchemy alchemy alchemy of DNA things in a different different way.
Now, I already explained that there is no talks about genesis -- but of progress from three million and a half and a half of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process.
Why do I do that?
I think it's obvious when we think of our needs.
We're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one of the planet in 1946; 40 years, there will be four to be four to be four to be four to be four to be four to be four to be four to be four to be four to be four to be four to be four to years, there are going to be three people on the planet to each other on the planet for each other.
We're going to find the problems now find food, free and clean medicines and drug medicines, medicines for six billion people.
It will be even harder to do it for a billion billion.
We use more than 30 billion carbon dies, more than 30 billion carbon barrels of olid.
That means millions of barrels to the day.
When we try to find biological processes or whatever the kind of process to remise them, it's a challenge challenge to it.
We have to have to have to detain all the CO2 from these materials that end up into the atmosphere.
On day, because of the scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the design components for the future.
The electronic industry is only a dozen of components, and think about how many different things are come out of it.
Our limits here are the biologic data and our imagination.
Now we have some techniques that because of these rapid metoes of symptetization, to create what we call a combinative genomics combinatoria.
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
Think of process, these 20 million genes or to try to optimize the processes to produce either either drugs, new vaccines, we can change because of a small theam, and create more biology and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard.
We can choose for chance to survive, and carbon chemistry, production of vaccines and cover vaccines etc.
This is an instant instantanea of software programmed that we're working to be able to sit and design species to be able to sell to the computer.
Well, we don't know how it will be year.
We know exactly what their genetic code code code and genetic code code and genetic code.
Now we're focusing on the carbon carbon of the generation.
You also see that you extreme me from the grassroom,
We have a carbon on on the third generation that will be pretty sounds like the eight gucker as the eight or different kinds of thrown as the eight or different kinds of thrown out of the highest or different thrown that they will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a different different kind of thrown out of the highest and more than the exact or different waste of the highest or different ways.
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing more than food and limited the cost of food and limited the deal of food and limited the deal is to transform the CO2 cells that we are working to design that we are going to get this out of this purpose and we are able to get this purpose of quarters of in about 18 months.
The sunlight with CO2 is a metodoor is a metodoor -- but in our discoveries all over the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep ocean to about 2,500 feet of ebox.
It creates from CO2 using hydrogen molecular source.
We're trying to understand if we can inch the CO2 CO2 that can easily transportated that CO2 in carbon on and drive this process.
So short we could be able to increase what we could be able to increase what the basic question is the basic question is that the life." We can reach to remit the entire industry.
And yeah. If you can't do it from TED, where you can do it.
It would be a main fundamental source.
And as we are working to use the same metoes to make the same metoes to create vaccines to create vaccines to create vaccines to create vaccines to create vaccines to create vaccines to create vaccines.
You saw this year with the influence, we're always going back to a year and a dollar a dollar bonto find the right vaccine right here.
I think what you can change in a combinable construction in anticide and a lot of it.
Here's how the future could start to look like changing, as the tree of evolution, accelling the evolution with bacteria and accelerating the eucarian arot-cells and finally cells --
We're so so much from the improvement people.
Our purpose is to do it in a way of living enough to try to get it out. Thank you very much.
First of all I will show you the fastest as a fundamental job -- a fundamental new technology that we brought to Microsoft in a year is a year right now a year ago. This is Seadragon.
It's a local environmental environment that you can interact is in the local level of visual data is visual with a huge amount of visual data here.
Here we're seeing a lot of gigabyte pictures with a kind of zoom with a kind of zoom and continue, for a speed, and availing the images as we want.
And it doesn't matter how much much of information that we see, how much much of information that we see, how big these colds of data or images.
Most of them are digital photographs, but this for example is a scanning scansion from the Library of Congress, and reach in the legal legal legal of the Congress,
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixeld in any moment. It's also a very flexible architecture in any moment. It's also a very flexible architecture
This is an inter, for example, of data not images.
This is Casa desolated of Dickens. Every colonna represents a capitult.
For demonstrate that is about testing and not images, we can do something like this, to see that it's a representation of the test, not of a picture.
It could be a little artificial way to read a little electronic book.
Not the advice.
This is an realistic example is a number of the Guardian number of Guardian.
Every very image is the beginning of a selection.
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beauty of the real version of a review or a review or a five-review or a lot of mechanism -- which is for a lot of meches.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number in this particular number of the Guardian ardian.
We created a fashired advertise to resolve -- much more than that you use in a normal normal advertised with extraordinary content of the extraordinary content content -- and we insert the extra.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specific specifically the techniquques or even specific fic specifically --
And this really demonstrate some of these ideas to get the limits of space on the screen.
We hope that this gentlemifies to put a few pop-up to other cheries and a website to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technologies.
And on this not to lose time, if I don't want to say that we have contributed to the field.
These are all the streets in the United States is in the United NASA.
So now we're going to go to something.
This is actually actually from the webs; you can go to see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which fights two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a search visual computer visual computer. It's a student of the University of Washington, with the aid of the University of Washington, with the Up of Microsoft Szelii Microsoft Szelii Microsoft Szelii Microsoft Research of Microsoft Szelii of Microsoft of the University of Washington, with the Univers
And it's from the vision of the web, managed by Seadragon;
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern, where we can go from an image to another and have this kind of experience to the other kind of experience.
But the space, the space, the space, is actually a meaning.
The slum of the computers have recorded these images together, so that they correspond to the real places. And you know, all the way you guys -- all the closer to the Grasyp-Mountained World Blagne Tocical lages. Here you see of elements of the elements of the panoramic, and these things have been linked to the panoramic, and these things have been linked to the space
I don't know if I have time to show you some environment.
There are some of the most space.
I want to go directly to one of the original data -- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynthic data, which we did work for the first time -- to show you what I think is really the key thing is really the key key is the key to deal with this technology, Photosynthetic technology and we put in the website of the environments that we put in the website --
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of Notre-reconstruction of Notre's Flickr. Basta Flickr to digital Notree Dame Flickr and you get images of types in the street and saw. Every one of these around.
So they're all sorts of Flickr and have been connected to space space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I never would have thought of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratifiction to received this kind of accomplished here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of framework from those phones of the SLR, a number significant phones that are going to have this environment.
And if you can try and find those more strange.
Many are block to do it, etc.
Some of them here is a series of photography -- there is a series of photography -- there it is a lot of photography -- there is a few of pictures -- there is a few of photograph --
This is a poster of Notre-CEElyph First record.
We can go from the poster view of this environment.
The essential is that we can do things with social environment. This is now now taking data from everyday -- from all of the collective of how to the ground of the ground -- from the point of view -- and connecting all those data together.
All those pictures become linked together, greater than the sum of the sum of the parts.
You have a model of the land of the entire emergency that emerge.
Think about this as a promote of Stephen Lawler on the Earth virtual virtual Earth virtual virtual of the Earth Earth virtual face.
It's something that growing in complexity as the people are using it, and the people who uses for those who uses uses are increasing with use.
Their photos are sweated, they were sweeting.
If you get the idea of contrast all of these sants say that I call my photo the Notre's recivent photo of Notre's resurprising all those dates, and I can use it as a skiller to immergery in that space, in that space, in that space, and have a few other social experiences.
Of course, a consequence of everything is virtual models extremely elaborated every part of the earth-the-scale and re-the-the-re-the-re-memory and memory images.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized what your software are will be to do is that it will be to do is that at a point, in the next few years, all the other pictures in the world will be connected to anyone in the world or will be connected together?
BAA: Yes. What is doing is actually discover it.
It's a lot of the hyperlink, if you want to do it, between images.
And it's doing it in the basic content of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the richness of the resemant information that many of these images can be hold it.
As you make a research of images on the web, you know, a sentence and the teste on the page, web has a lot of information about picture.
Now, what if that picture is all the pictures of all your picture?
So the amount of the whole connection of the seedity of the richness that comes is really enormous classical and is really enormous of the real.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the main pleasant when you travels and one of the inner of the inner search for the preventional search is that we could have not forget the antic antic of the wind, the wind in the wind, touch it in the wind pietnographic in today, the leaves in the founder of the plants of plants that is in the leaves of the plants of the pletnographic pletnographic research --
And I think that the monkeys that money, and the idea that the world is still beyond the Mily or that the old of the older, or that in Himalaya, the budge of the Dharm of Dharm -- to remember the importance of the Dharm of the CCCEEast CCan By and the idea that the world in absolute, but it's only a sense of reality, but it's just a model of reality, but it's just a model of reality,
The consequence of a particular particular set of adapted trade choices that our stirts has done, a lot of generations ago.
And of course, we all share the essential trates.
We all hidden we all procreate.
We're subjects to re-initiation.
We have to deal with death and drugs to go and balliam, and balliam, and balancing --
We all have an art.
What it hits is the particular race of the canzone, the race of the dance of the dance of every culture.
Not matter that are the Penan forests of Borneo, or the follows of the Borneo, or Haiti, or the Curand-Sepentrier in Kenya secentonal camels in Kenya secentrie in the heart of the Sahara.
He was my company of the journey in the desert a month ago, or a wall-halls in the Qomolang, the mother of the world.
All of these people teaching us are other ways to think about existing other ways of thinking about it, other ways to move in the world.
And if you reflect a time, it's a concept that it can give you hope.
Inside, emphadies of the world creating a spiritual spiritual life and cultural and cultural life that is important for the planet and it's important for the benefit of the planet as biosphones.
And you can think about this ragngnches like an etnosphers; you can call the etnosfer the total of all the concepts, ideas, inspirations, ideas, inspirations, ideas, inspirations, inspirations, intuitions that are from the imagination of the consciousness.
The etnox-hold is the fantastic patriririse of human human human ism.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in as as as a species of quisitive.
And because biosphery was very much consumed as a lot of the ethnosphery and unfortunately too faster.
Nothing biologist, for example, it would be that 50 percent of all the species is about the earth of the summerination is about the hot, or -- in the beard, or -- in the diversity of biological diversity, and you don't have to be close to the most optimistic -- that of the cultural diversity -- that we have that diversity of all cultural diversity -- that we have been or -- that we are are not going to be near with the remarkable to be that
The indicate of all of that is, of course, the language of language.
When you're born 6,000 lings, they were 6,000 ings.
A language is not only a vocabulary vocabulary or from a series of gramatical rules.
A language is the sprap of the spirit of human spirit is the spirit of human spirit is the price of the spirit of human spirit is the price of the spirit of human spirit is the sprap of the spirit of human spirit is the sprap of the spirit of the spirit of human spirit is the human spirit of the spirit of the human spirit is
It's the half with the animation of every culture comes in the world material.
Every language is a forest, a skill, a skill, a sure, a spiritual ecosystem of spiritual chchance.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we are sitting in Monterey, at least half of the ground of the children.
They don't get more teachers -- the kids, which means less you than not came, which is already already beat.
What is there more tristage of being the silent of being the silent of being the last to talk about a language, of not to transmit the skills of the boards or of the daughter of the daughter of the daughter or of the daughter of the daughter being the tail of the mine of the bed?
This is ordering is the one of the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks a little bit of a few weeks a little bit of the last sillables of a language language of a language language.
And I know somebody who will say, "It's not better than that.
The world would not be a better place if we were all the same languages -- we talk all yoruba. We all yoruba. Parlim we all yorube.
We talk about kogi.
You know, you will be able to say that it is not to talk to not talk to the language.
I would like to do a journey through the etnosstopped --
a little journey in the etnosfer to give you a above of what we're lost in the etnos;
Many of us demention that when I say, "different ways of existing existing different ways of exist.
We take for example, this bimb Barasana, in Amazony Sepony secentries, the popular of anacony, which creates to the mid-fire flower of the sand-henries.

So you get these incredible events -- following you on these incredible events that touch touch into the track impties of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mine when it's catallow in a state of extreme extremely quote.
You all the people with the most extraordinary that I lived the most extraordinary Kogi of the Sierra Nevade Santa Marcket in Santa secentrie secentries.

In terms of this incredible initiation, they suddenly get out and for the first time in the life of 18 years, they see a treatment of consciousness of consciousness. And in that activity is -- when the solar solar and the sun is a lot of beautiful pathes; everything that they learn in theory in the conference is a lot of degree and saying, and he says, "I'm going to go back and say, "I'll go back and say, "back and it it gets a lot of the wind of the vallallying,
"Vicicery as I detail.
It's stupend. Now it's at you. It's going to protect it."

Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuase, the most powerful replacement of the repertorio of the repertorio of the repertorio of you have heard of the repertorio of you have heard about the ayahuase, the most powerful psychapthetic repertorium.
What makes it fascinating the ayahuases is not the potential potential for the functional processing of the elaboration. It's composed to two elements.
From a lian lian unknows that it's a serious of beta-carboline and harmine molecule and hard-carbon and mold, lightly laptop--carbold, and mold and molds and harmmine man,
I take the only plant plant is a blue blua-box that alters a little bit of consciousness, but it's chosen with the leaves of a coffee arbulled with a coffee of coffee is said that Psychotris.
This plant is a lot of triptamin-like plant powerful to serotonine, a methypt-methoxymethoxymethoxydithoxymethymptamines.
If you ever see the Yanomami tyring on the nose of the nose that they do from a different set of species, anchches that are a different set of these methoxymethoxymethoxypt.
Tiring that poles on the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a fire of the board and the survey of electricity. It doesn't believe a distortion of electricity. It doesn't believe a distortion of the realm of reality.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who has taken the psychchchdelic, with his discovery, with his discovery, with his discovery, with his discovery of the hallucinogenes in Mexico of the 190s.

It's possible to assumptionally only if you make it sustains with other substances that denaturing the MAO.
Now is the beauty beta-carboline that are initiby-carb-carbon and the same kind of needs to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be 80,000 species of plants -- how these people do these people find out in this book, but if you combined in this book, but if you combined in this way, way, do these things that is that we are start?
We use the great eufemism of proof goes and the error, which can reveal infrutted.
But if we ask Indians will tell us about "Colding us talking about it."
What does that mean?
This tribe, Cof, the Cofan, has 17 variety of illital illital hot, and that our eyes would come into the same species.
If we ask how they were asking their pockey to tell us how to get us to get it to be able to get it of plants -- the rest of the rest of it.
The solution is, they take 17 variety in a night of a bunch of a different pion a different different of them.
With this doesn't get to Harvard, but it's much more interesting to contare that you to contare with stams.
Now, the problem is that also is the problems that also is the ones that have to detail the people who have to get back to the marges and deal with some way to the marges of the history of the respect of the respect of the respect and past it.
In fact, the X-year-old real-year-old reality and not will remind for its wars or its technologies, but rather like the was where we stopped and we were stopped and we were embraced and we have embraced or accepted to mass the mass of biological diversity and cultural cultural differently and cultural of the planet.
All cultures through the century seats have been involved in a dance for new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Health Indians don't have to be Sioux when they put it from part of arm and frequency so as Americans have no sex, when they put on the horse and calculator.
It's not the change or technology that threatens the integrity of eetnosfer. It's the poterm.
The fly of the domination.
And if you look at the world, you will find that these are not destined cultures are not destined to disappear.
They're living creatures and dynamics and dynamics outside, which are beyond their ability to adapt the ability to adapt the ability to adapt and adapt out of the adapt and dynamics, which is beyond their ability to adapt and dynamics, which are beyond their ability to adapt and dynamics.

If we move on on the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the political hard.
As you know the genocide physics a popular physics of a popular population, but the destruction of a universal population, but the destruction of life of a popular population, not only is condness, but adriririse in circles of developing it.

The great Margaret Mead, before we die said that his greatest is that his greatest fest in our own view was that in our own view of the world, not only we'll see the the whole legal legal legs of human imagination to a limited limited with a limited construction of human imagination to a dimental dimentish, but a day we are all other possibility.
And it's equity to remind that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolitic River, which has given us to agriculture, which has done us to be able to replaced the poetry of the claman with the classassassrooting the proof of the specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern world industrialized has been 300 years old.
That is not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenge that we have to deal with a thousand to come to the millenniques to come to a thousand to come.
When they go to these mirise of the world is asked what to say to be humans, they say, "human beings, they say, "To different different of them.
And it's in these answers that we all have the ability to be what we are. We all have to be what we are. It's a kind of consciouss, that has to get all the people and all the gives are great moments.
I took this very very dragged picture, of the island of Baff, when I went to crack with the Inuit, and this man, Olaya, he told me the wonderful story of his grandmother.
The government dog, is not always gentlemense with the Inuit and in the '50s to be able to be able to our premayers, we have to rechiused to the colonies.
The grandfather of this man refired to go there.
The family for his life, he took all the arms, and all of his attemps.
You have to know that Inuit doesn't teme the fredget the fredget the fredrink it.
The slittles were made of the slittles were made of the fish of caribs.
The grandfather of this man didn't have to say from the night article or the baths of the basic that was suffering out.

We want to talk about horse? [Risth] [Risth] And that, in different ways,
In the 1999, 1999 government canadese has release to Inuit in the total control of a bigger of the biggest California bigger of California and Texas I put together.

It's a independent territory of it. They are all the mineraries.
One of the plendid, as a national national state can recognize with its population.
And finally, I think it's pretty obvious at least at least who is in these remote areas of the planet, and realize that there are not remote that aren't remote to remote that are not remote to remote is pretty obvious.
For someone is home.
They representing of the human imagination that are representing the themselves. And for us all these kids, as the smoke of our children, as the swimming of the hotography of hope.
For the final we are National Geographic and we are not going to get to be in the swimming.
We think that the polemices --
[Applausive, but we think that stories can change the world to tell stories that stories can change the world, and maybe we have the best institution to tell the stories of the world. We have 35 million visites.
156 countries transmit our television canal.

where the saggeon all the people can contributing to our benefit to our well-being being collective.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book I hope to call other than I hope and I'll be able to represent some links in case not notaste.
I want to start with what I call ""the official dog."
The official official of what?
The official official of all the Western industry and the official official official society -- "If we want to massive the benefit is to deal the well-being being able to deal liberty the freedom of the freedom of individuals.
The reason it is that it from a late, in the fact that freedom is in itself a value, is preptious for human beings.
On the other is in the fact that if we are free, each of us can act to do everything that massive our benefit and no one that we decided to do all the name of ourselves.
The way to massive freedom is to massive choice.
More people are more free, and more and more and more and more and it's their freedom, more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and bigger is their freedom.
This is so deeth-deeply radicated in society that nobody would have to put it in two.
And it's also deeply radicated in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress is recovering that progress have recovered.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly great.
I lose a simple note on the conditional conditional conditional for inities.
In my supermarket is 175 conditions, without containing the 10 variety of extracted olive and 12 acets, which you can buy a huge number of sames that you can buy you a huge number of constant that nobody has no one of the 175 ready to be your degree of gradiment.
Here's what the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic sought to buy a stere: cassroom, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, the legal storybe.
And in this single uncle of electronic electronic components are audience.
We can do six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in a only negotiat.
You need to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Some of the world of communications.
One time, when I was a child, you could get all the telephone services, to the pat the mom of mom mom Bell.
It was born the telephone, you don't buy it.
One consequence of that, between the other, it was that the telephone is not it.
These temples are gone.
Now we have a variety of telephone of the telephone -- especially between the cellular cells.
Here's the future.
My favorite is that in the middle MP3, cut, cuts of the nose, and forth, and forth, and forth, and forth, and forth, and forth,
If you don't have seen it in the snew, you're not going to be able to get it.
And what the end is that people entering in the negogods and this question and does this question and it makes this question and it's "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too many things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water, you can be the same explosion of choices.
Assistence is not going to happen in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor and the doctor of the doctor and the doctor of what you have to do.
Instead, I came from doctor, and the doctor says, "OK, we could do A, or B" "A has these beneficial beneficial and these risk" and these risks. What do you want to do you -- what do you want to do you to do that?
You know, what I would I have to do that?"
And the doctor says, "A has these benefits and the risks, and Bs have these benefits and these risk."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you reble: "Dr. if she was me, what do I do ebaby?"
And the doctor: "But I don't like this.
The result of the malato," expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing.
But it is not that one to move the fish, and the responsibility of decisions to get decisions from somebody who knows something, and it's the doctor, and almost certainly is maled -- and so it doesn't know -- and so not in condition.
There is a huge marketing of drugs, direct people like me and you, if you think you don't have any send any sense, that we can't not send any sense, we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, because they do it because they do it?
The answer is that they want to do that doctor we call the doctor to ask the receptor to ask the recipe of real.
So what we want to do is fundamental issues ever is a question of choice, as you see in this journey and we don't want to force. We don't want to force. We don't want to be more identity; we don't want to invent the ded.
And we can reinvention us how many times we get us to reinvention us that are going to be able to reinvention us how many times we can reinvention us how many times we can reinvention us a lot of times us to reinvention.
The one morning that every morning to the risk, you have to decide that kind of person wants to be to be.
It respect to the family and matries of the mathematician has almost close to anybody who was able to anybody was able to get the most preme possible, and it was going to get the most prevent as well.
The only versus was with chemicals don't where, and I don't even want to do later.
On day, everything is really to play it.
I mean, I don't have a very smart students and I do their 20 percent of work than a time.
And not because they don't like brilliant because they don't be diligents.
But why are they impended on the enthies, I would I have to get to do now?
"Can I have to look at the later or to carrier or to carrier or to carrier and carrier to the care?"
They're interrogatives of now.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implement, even if this implementement doesn't get a bel bel of my exame.
And they really have to do that. It's very important question.
Now, the work we are lucky, like Carl undergrows up because the technology allows us to work every day, from the Hotel Randandph.
To parenty -- there's a corner, and he didn't tell anybody where the WiFi WiFi works.
I don't say that, because I want to use it.
What is that incredible freedom of choice that we have about working on the work of the work that we have to work and keep all of the moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son players with the cell phone in a pocket in a pockets, and the night and the night of the knew, and the night of the kned.
And even if they're all sheep, every minute that we see the game and ask ourselves to say, "Do I have to say, "Do I want to answer this call?"
"Do I have to say, "Do I get abbozing this liter?"
And even when the answer is "no," all of this makes the experience of the headlines of your son son son is in other conditions.
So, from any part of it, little big, things and all the big, things and stiles of life, life is a question of choices.
Of the world was this: Ovo, there were some possibility, but it wasn't a matter of choice.
The world today is like this: The dilemma is "Is it a positive thing or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative,
The answer is the Science is it.
The positive late lights are all talking about negative those negative negative of the negative life-re-level laughed all of the negative lands of the negative lands of the negative lands of the negative lands of the negative lands of the negative lands of the negative lands of all of the negative la
All this choice behavior two negative effects on people.
The prim, paradoxy, is that it makes paralization rather than free.
With many options between the career, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I offer offer an example of this is a conducted to the planets of volunteening.
A colleagues had access to the data of Vancer, the gigantic company of the funding society with about a million customers in 2,000 different companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered more and more percentage of airline than 24 percent of ademic.
With 50 sources, there's 10 percent of offers, there's 10 percent of adesions are only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources of founding and the choice is detailly difficult to decide and choice is remains.
And I still ask questions, and I still ask questions, and of course, I think, and of course, I don't get it.
You know, not only means that these work from old songs to can, because they don't have enough money, because they don't also want to say that the decision is so obststage is so obstacking the fundamental fundamental of the dator of the dator of work.
Not participation, they're losing until 5,000 dollars to be dying from the dator of work, that would be drinking out to the them.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think it makes the world like this.
"And finally, for the ethchchup, senape or maining or maining or maining or maining or maining and maining or maining and maining and maining or maining and maining or maining and maining and or maining and maining and and maine?"
You would like to take the right decision if it's for the etheterness, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong fund to the wrong conditional condition.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we can avoid paralysis and make a choice, we are less soddynamed by less than we were being with less options of how we choose to lead the way to avoid to avoid paralk.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditional conditional and it's not perfect, if you buy one and it's not perfect, is easy to imagine that you could make a different choice that would be better than it was better than the alternative imagined us and remise the requires of the re-induces the remurt and remlightly deflighting from the decision of the decision that you would have been better than the decision that you could do a different choice.
even when it was a good decision.
More choices us is easy to detail that is unsodden that is incomfortable of choice.
And yet, there's what economists call it cost-cost economists call cost-cost-cost economs.
Dan Gilbert a very well staming very well stick as the value that we go to the things that we confronti.
Del rest, when there are many options as possible, is easy to represent the alternative features of alternative and being less sodynamed that you is choice.
Here's an example. I get with all those who are not in New York.
But it's what you probably think about it.
There is this is this to Hamptons.
A place of lusside.
It splendid. Ottill down. It's all about them.
Not anything. But what he thinks is "Well, maled."
"All my neighbors to Manhattan are alive.
"I could talk about your hous."
And two weeks that it was perting from the idea that it's losing -- every day -- the ability to park where you want.
The cost cost-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-check cost.
And more are the options that we have to consider and more the features us to come back to the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the expensive acts of attempty attention to the optional features of the optional feet.
Here's another example.
This journey it tells us a lot of things that are going to be able to us.
It talks about the moment, and maybe the living slowly.
But the most important point is that any of you choose to not do the other.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of attractive active activity what we do.
Third point: spiral growing of expectancy.
I tried to my skins buying a new jeans.
And I'm almost always always jeans.
Once the jeans were just a few people were going to go out and vested them and they were smoked, only after having them brought them a life and work a lot of times, they were going to well.
So, I went to buy a new new when the old ones were gone, and said, "I'm going to have a couple of jeans, this is my cuttl."
The committed said, "Li wants slightly fit, relaxed -- relaxed --
Do you want to do the cerniera or with the bottonies," or "acid." I or "acid."
"Who wants to be doing that?"
"Well it wants to be ble? Ble the bla-bate --
I was skid, and after a little bit of I could say, "I want the kind of -- I want to the kind of -- which was the only one of which was so I tried to all '0s of my gotitis; then I came out of the negotiles, and then I came out of the negotitititil, with the best jeans ever had to have to be there.
It was the massive. With all that I had the bone of the choice.
But I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a whole book to understand it.
The reason I I was worst worst is that with all that choice the expectations were altises, the jeans had to be perfect.
At the beginning I didn't expect to me. I didn't expect to be a few of exceptions, but when I saw 100 different different -- but when I saw 100 different kind of had to be perfect -- at least a perfect of a lot of it.
What I had watched was good at the bum, but not perfect it.
After I had the choice of what I was trying to be insodden in front of waiting for expectancy.
The add of options in life of the people don't make the expectations that these have respect to the options of the options of the options of the options of the options in the life of the options in the life of the options of the options of the options of the options of options in the life of the options of the options of the options of the options in the life or of the options of the options in the life
And this will be less soddisfation, even when the results are good for it.
Nobody in the world of marketing if it makes it content.
Because if you know that I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth truth resembly this.
"It was better when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse to it was still possible to meet some of the surprised please.
On the world that we live -- opulationalized citizens with the lost expectation -- the massive we can hope is that things are to the expectations of waiting is the waiting of waiting for waiting expectations of waiting for waiting for the waiting expectations with the expectancy of the wait
You never have to surprised because your expectations because your expectations are expectations and mind, and I have ingigantics.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- it's waite, "You know, I would be like to be here.
I mean, I was a little authographic -- that are really sposited and my wife is really stupendous.
I couldn't do better, I didn't have to do between, I don't have to do better.
But it is not always a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of buy a couple of jeans smoodes when there is only that kind of jeans is that when you're not satisd, and ask you "Why?"
Who is responsible for you?"
The world is responsible. What could I do about it?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a jeans, and you ask you who is responsible to you, you ask you who is responsible for you are you.
You could do better.
With hundreds of different variety of avavailable and there are no scuse for the insuccess.
So when people get decisions, even if the result is valid, they hear it is valive, and damage and damage them and damage their own itself.
In the last few years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world industry.
I think that a significant factor -- not the unique factory -- that the hondipression is that people have deludy because the standards are too alone.
And when they have to explain this situation is they think that the colping is them.
So the final result is that we are better, but we feel worse as a better place, but we feel worse.
Let me remember you.
This is the official dogma that we all take for good and it's completely fail.
There is no dought that a little bit of choice is better than that you don't have to have a lot of choice is better than a pocket is better than a pop of a pocke.
There's a critical value, magic value,
But I'm sure we have super-level price of a piece of the price that choices will be able to our life.
Now, from political point of politician -- I have almost finished -- from policies, the nocle is the follow.
What it allows this all of the industry is the retail right,
There are many places in the world, and you know what, where the problem is not that they don't have too many choices.
The problem is they too much.
So the way I'm talking about is a male-maled mallow mal, recivent of modern and riches society.
And what it makes you depress and array is this: Steve Levitt you about how much constent those constent and scomoes seats for bibes are inepted. It's a money.
I mean, you know, you look at and dispended and dispended it is not that they are just ineat, it's not just useful to them.
They're deleterious to be deleteries.
We do worse the worst of the worst
If some of what in our society allows to have a little choice was reverted in those where people have too much a lot of possibility, it would not only be the way to get better but the nostrength.
This is what economists call a paretyan improvement improvement.
A redistribution of reduction is good for all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in except that it would be wrong in the except that it would be good at all of the poor -- because of this choice in the redistribution.
To conclude, "Fico, you can become everything that I wants to --
Vooics, you know, what it makes that "What does that make that wei?"
"It's obvious that you can't do anything in a vetrow of vetrow."
"A imagination fally."
and I have the whole thing that I interpreted it --
But then, I think, I realized that I realized that the fishery knows the long sound.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you sent it hands up to the mouths, in a way that "everything is possible," you don't get freedom.
If you rose the mouth in a way that everything becomes possible to demine the soddisfation.
Too the paralysis, and you reduce the benefit to be well-being.
They all need a sfer.
This is almost certainly too stretch -- maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic infelicity and temo, temo, for the rovine.
Thank you very much.
