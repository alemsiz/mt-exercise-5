And last year I showed these slide to demonstrate that the glacial calot, which for almost three million years has had had the size of 48 million years has had the size of 48 percent of the United States of 40 percent.
However, this subvalue of the problem because it doesn't show the of.
The art calotathot is in a sense, the clean heart heart, the climath heart of global climate system.
You expands of the winner and the summer.
The next slide will be a rapid of the last 25 years became to the last 25 years.
The gaus lost are signed in red.
You can see, they expand they expand the blue screws.
That's the ice in the winter, which is the summer.
You can see that the so-called the glacious glacior or more, it's like the blood that smoke, which is the blood out of the body.
In 25 years has spent like this, at the time.
This is a problem because interested in the artor of the artor where there are huge amount of carbon that are enormous quantity of carbon that sheet clean that sheet out of the microbies.
Respack to the totality of the atmospheric inugly pollution of global warming, that amount could double beyond this pollution of not return.
In some laka little deep deep in Alaska metan is already reboiling from the water.
The professor. Katey Walter University of Alaska has recated team reced with a team of the degree deal with a team of the winter.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: She's good. The question is whether we will be well.
A reason is that this exchange is that the Greenland of the Greenland from the north.
This is a fium of glacial regim.
The took never reached levels like this.
This is the Kangerlusaq, in the South Greenland of the Greenland of the Greenland
If you want to know how the level of the sea level of the sea level, here is where the sea level of the sea.
These corrups are increasing rapidly.
On the other side of the planet. Antarct's biggest ice of the planet.
The month, the scientists have declared that the balance of the ice is in negative, and that Antarcts, that Antarcts, which is particularly rapid in the submitts, is particularly rapid in the sheet.
Which is a six feet level, like Greenlevel, like Greenlevel.
On Himalaya, the third largest block of ice block in the laghi, who were seen in the laghyds.
Our percent of the world's population recently reached half the poll.
On Ande: this glacier is the source of the city of this city.
The took is increased.
But when he diminutes the same accomplished water.
In California the snow on Sierra Nevada is decrecated by 40 percent.
The drive of the backs are in crisis.
The predictions, like you have read.
The growing of the world leads to a remarkable increasing for incendedes.
The environmental disasters are increasing to a reoutside and without previous precedent.
Four times more than the last 30 years than the last 30 years of previous respect to the previous 175.
This is a regigment of insustainable to it.
If you look at it in the context of the historical contexts.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the East of the oriental Pacific Pacific America, and the west, the west, where there's a radical impositional imposition, where there's a radical imposition.
The major of global warming, together to deforestation, together which is the 20 percent, is the using of fossils.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is a problem, and the carbon is even worse --
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions, together to China.
And it proposed to build a lot of other carbon and maintains
But we're seeing to a change.
These are the annulled projects in the last few years and some of the alternative alternative res.
At any way, there's a political lotly in our country.
The carbon industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon that clean clean that is a oxy-in-died oxium.
The image reminded me to remind me --
Natal, in Tennessee, where I live there was a 3.8 billion liths of carbon die of carbon die of carbon dial carbon die.
You can see it on the news.
This is the second largest flow of chories in America.
It's happened around Natmains.
The natalized publish of one of the carbon industries was this:
Video: Shydrosty carbon is a kind of hallegrus.
It's deliver, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is more and more clean is more cleaner.
It's about price, adorable and workers keep the workers keep the stipend.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The largest societies on the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his administrator.
Video: Don Blankship: I'm going to be clearly -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelosisidle Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for the Proteam of Clima has launched two countrys.
This is a but, one side.
Video: All right: At we see the climate changes like a threat of the climate changes like a threat to our business even.
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a public effort to make public and confuses the truth on the charcoal.
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it's cleaned -- it's also a good profum.
So not previous about climate changes of climate change.
Let me do to do it.
Video: Atorie: Carbone clean -- you have heard a lot of talking about a lot of it.
So let's take a gyp around a structure of the clean to the carbon digits.
Straordinarily machines are a little noisy of chpull technology.
The carbon is between the main causes of global warming causes of global warms, but the remarkable technology of the carbon that you see changes everything.
You look at a cheat: this is the hatch, technology.
Al Gore: Inded, the positive alternative is connected to the economic security.
Video: Comment: The America, is in crisis, the national security crisis.
The move that colleagues all of the records, our dependence of fossils, like the dirty and the important.
Now, there's a new new audge, solution for using circums.
America: 100-year-old energy energy in diet, 10 years.
They have to reput America to work on work, to make sure you, and help stopping the global warming.
Finally, a solution that you have to solve our problems.
By America. You practice more than that.
Al Gore: This is the moment.
Video: Comment: It's about to reach energy to America.
One of the fastest enough of the dependence dependence on the planet.
And what I do is, the future is here. Ree, only a new network,
She bleet 2: Noves investment for places of well-retribed work.
M: Repower America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A proverbbie African proverbable African proverbs you go to the sun.
If you want to go away together."
We have to go away very quickly.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED fect at TED fect on LHC.
And I promise to return to the how the machine.
So here I got it. And for those who the other time is no here, the LHC is the largest scientific experiment -- 27 kilometers of circus of circus of circus surround.
His comfortable to realize the conditions that were less than a billion second of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
This is simply environment.
This is the underneath Gineva.
We photographing these mini-Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Big Bang Big Big Bang Bievators.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's larger 44 feet and has a 22 feet diamet.
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
The 10 seven-to-set last year we have access,
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was a lot of immense festate in the control.
It's a picture of the first particle phase, which had done all the sky's around the LHC, and deliberately deliberately, and spread particles, and spread particles, and spread particles,
In other words, when we see that image the 10 seven, we understand that the machine, we understand that machines worked -- that it's a great life.
I don't know if it was to do it exultate this, when somebody went to Google and saw that the beginning was this.
That means that we had a cultural impact that we had a cultural impact to the scientific connection.
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, had to these sources here -- these clean movie files.
These files carries 13,000 prints when the machines works at the massive power.
Now, the technical technical technical movies and say, "It's not true. I'm not true. I'm films too underly."
And instead they can do it because when they're very cold when they are superconvictions.
So, at less 271 degrees, at a high temperature in the space between stars, these movies can bring that corrup.
In one of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a defect defect of the magnets in the LHC, there was a defect deft.
So the files were surris-up and 13,000 prints suddenly meeting was a resistance of electrical ely.
This was the result.
Now, this is more impressing if you think that these magnets are 20 tons of the tons of 20 tons that have moved about 30 centimeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to get them to be to touch it, what we did it.
We have them restored and add it.
They're now now getting back to the ground.
English the end of LHC is going to be new intely.
We will accenate it, and we expect to get the data or slums or slums or and keep so our adventure to discover what are the mattones that are the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain quarter way, these crash clusters to the debate of science and engineering. It's easy to conflip it. It's easy to conflip and the frontiers.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think it's the value of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the words of a scientist scientist of the inuseful science in defense of inuseful inuseful inuseful inuseful for the progress of his pupll, his clean was Michael Faray, he said, "No much dangerous than human mind as the human mind of the mind that there are definitive beings of nature, and the science of the trip, and the experiments of the mind of the world."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about here, and to rethink about here, from a children, played the morning with the morning
While you understand how to reach them and spread them and to reach them and moving them to think about and solve them to think and solve problems and solve relationships.
The reason is deeply connected to the way we understand part of the world around us.
So, as an inspired by using the uses of our interaction with physics, together to my consults, together to my collaboratory collaboratory and my collaboratory collaboratory and said, "And if we use a computer, instead of having the mouse of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse as a drug mouse as a sady information with entramming entertains that you can information with both of the hands
and to our pleased please?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided we would explore the answer to the answer --
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a great discovered computer interactive as a biocot.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a great discovered computer interactive as a biocot.
You can move them with the hand, they can see it ""The movement and have a screen and have a screen and a wireless.
But absolutely physics, like the morning objects, as the batter can be able to be able to be able to be able to reach them.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the information.
And as we become more physics, and as we consciously as we motion, others, and the others, and the people become more physics, and the others, how we can explore and the different stils of the motion, we can explore and different stils and different stils of interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This is configurated to show the video if you inct it into a direction, the video will turn to the other side will including it back to the other side back.
These interactive riticians are aware of the others.
If they are interested in what they are interested in what it's going to be there.
If they come circumstom, and they can ager a little bit.
If they come circumstom, and they can ager a little bit.
They also have their movement and incline.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use the common data -- a couple of the interaction as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated secks and I can use them to the color in the central central central central to the color.
and I can use them to put them to the color in the central central color, where they mix.
If we can get a little bit of it, we can put a little bit about it.
There's also beautiful open-opportuns, like the languages, mathematics and logical players where people can try and see the results of logical things and see the resultype results.
I'm --
This is a Fibonacus sequence of Fibonacus that I do with a program.
Here we have a words of words that is at Scarabeum and Boggle.
Basically, to every turn Siftable, you know, a letter to every Siftable, Pratratically, to every turn Siftable, and while you try to get words of words on a dictionarie.
And after about 30 seconds remissing, and you have a new set of reading and new possibilities to try to get it.
Thank you.
Here's the children came to the Mida Lab, I did so that they tried them and I sent them and I sent them a video.
They are very pilled to them.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of education.
You just have to say, "Componons and they know exactly what to do.
Here's what other people trying to do it.
This is our most youngest bete, there in the right.
It actually wanted to get them to be clust.
They are just were battles, for him.
Now, this is a application of a interactive cardboard.
We wanted to build a tool to learning of the Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, rewing the Siftable their associated associated with them.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, rewing the Siftable their associated associated with them.
So, it's doing the sun.
Video: The Sun is sisting is sistering.
David Merrill: She took a treat the scene.
Video: The treatment treat.
Bel work!
So school by Siftable and put them close to make the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing their story.
Video: Cao!
DM: It's a story with final open-open-open-a-a-like final well.
DM: It's a story with final open-open-open-a-a-like final well.
Video: Video: See,
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, realized recently, to sample and to execk and to execk and to execk and to execk and to execk and to execk and the music.
it's a tool, realized recently, to sample and execk music.
The Siftable here are now that sound like based and battery.
Each of these has four different various variation, and you can choose what use.
You can indesert these sound in a sequence to be to comport to your be.
And it just making it simply to do a "so" and a "sequence" and a "sequence."
These are effects that you can control from living, like reverbers and the filter.
You attacks to a particular south and then including it.
And then there are the general effects like time and volume, which apply to apply the whole sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We will start putting a base in two Sift," we will put it into a series, we get to the extend to be add the other base.
Now I put a lower line.
Video: DM: Oh, I'm adding the percent,
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the movie to the bacteria, so I can control the effect from living.
Video: I can quickly run the whole sequence inclining the whole sequence of the side or the other.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the movie to the based to give more expression.
Video: I can get the sequence of the sequence "S."
So I didn't have to planned it before, but I can improvising, make it longer or more corty.
And now, finally, I can get the whole sequence inclining the whole sequence inclining the East sequence the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is build new interfaces that our brains are always more more than our brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this pattern and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept that I want to transmate you is that it's coming this new generation of objects to interact with the media digital media that will be information in our world in the way that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the hour of talking to all of you.
They're a writing scale.
Shing books is my professional physicians -- of course,
It's also the love and the fasr of my life.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But I said, something particular happened to my life and career recently and my career that brought me to realibrate the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is that I recently recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Ama" what, my previous books, for some reason in the world and became a big sensition in the world and became a big sensition -- and interaction.
And the result is that everywhere now, people are treating me as if I were to be convicted to me.
It's a convict -- convicted away.
They come to me and they say, "You don't have to be concerned and they say, "Don't you fear more to do it?
You don't have to keep writing to write for all life without could be able to create a book that can be able to make a book that can be able to do somebody to be able to do somebody else?"
that can be to matter somebody to me?"
It's remaining sure you know.
But it could go worse and part of that I remember 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a land-a-adolescent -- I wanted to be a ritice.
I would met against the same reaction of the same reaction.
And people told me, "Don't you set to have successful to have success?
Don't you fear that the humiliation of the reject that the humiliation of you?
You can't fear of doing this mester to do this mester of life without anything that comes up and must die on a sky clip with the baby of switches with the baby of loving core falliment?"
You know, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Yea."
I fear of all those things.
I always had to be fear.
And I also fear of many other things that people should not be to meeting.
As a and other things --
But as I think about it write what I thought and I would ask me is why is?
Is it ration?
It's logic, who needs to be expect to be frightened to do it.
But what is that particularly in the impresses creative to make us about the mental health of the mental health in a way that other career doesn't do?
How my father, for example, he was a chemistry and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he had to be afraid if he had to be engineer to be engineer if he had to be engineer to be engineering to be engineering chemistry and not remember about the one of his father, for example, where he was going to be a father
There was no -- that never -- that John, like this?
Don't work?
Enestly, the engineers like group don't have certain centuries, the reputing reputing the reputation of being ecolized maniacres of maniacres.
We have enough, we have enough this reputation, and not just a writers but creative of every genere, we have this reputation of being enormously instable to instable to of the reputing of the reputing of any generative reputing of any generative writers.
And it's not going to look at the contain, the dead of the magnific deaths that just in the 21st century, they die and often for hand.
And the ones that are not suicide seem to be really disdded by their womans.
Norman Mailer, before of die, in the last one of the last one of the book had killed me a little bit of a little more remarkable region to the work of their life.
But we don't get that when we heard about why we have these things that are so long, we heard these things that we have completely interiors and accepted the notion that the creativity and the art, the finally, and the artly, will always conduct to the angood.
And the question I want to ask all of the today is, are you agree with this idea?
It goes you do this -- because also watching it from a centimeter of me is not good for anything that supposed to be well for anything to supposed to be a supposed centimeter of it.
I think it's hodioxies.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see it in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great creative minds to live.
And I sureally, in my case -- in my case -- would be very dangerous to start to fugee to that feeling towards that I would be a dark respect to the circumstances where I'm in my career.
And you know, it's quite a little bit of a given years, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely to be write that I will be writing from the world like working that after the work that was going to be used by the world like that work that was going to be successful write of my last book.
I'm going to be sky, because we're all more or less friends here -- it's likely my biggest success is to my greatest success is a lot of the happens.
Oh, Gesus down, that though!
You know, this is the kind of thinking that it leads a person to start to begin to the nine morning and I don't want to do it.
I would be going to keep doing this work that we do.
So, the question become, what?
And so it seems to me after a lot of reflective to work to keep the way to do is to create a psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psy
I have to find a security of safety between me, that I'm writing and my natural anks that I am reacting the reaction of the reaction that was going to be able to get out of the models on how to do it to look through the time to see if they could have the best ideas to see if they could have the best ideas and healthy healthier and healthier heals.
how to help people creative to help people to do the inerents of creativity.
And that research has brought me to the ancient Greea and the ancient Rome.
You chequals because, and then you go back and back.
In the ancient Greea and the ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity came from men, OK?
It was thinking that creativity was this about the divine and that came to the men from a few surgers, and unknown as unknown as distant and unknown away and unknown to the sharp and unknown as well.
The Greeks called these demoniors of the "demoni."
Socrate, wonderful belief that was created to have a demone that elargiving wisdom from far away.
The Romans were the same idea, but they called the kind of spirit without the body of a genius.
Which is great because Romans didn't think that a genius really well a genius was somebody in particularly intelligent --
They believed that a was this kind of divine that was this kind of a deal of the study of a artist, a little like the Dobby, and that came out of the artist, and that came out of the artist, and that was the result of the artist, and modeling the result of that work.
Except -- et, that's the distance of which I talk -- that construct psychological that psychological psychological that protected you from your work.
And everyone knew that was so that it worked, right?
So the anties were protected by certain things, like the too narcism, right?
If your work was exceptional work was exceptional to everybody knows that everybody knows that I had been helped by this incorpore."
If your work failure, it wasn't all your own book?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inability.
And so people have the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And the Rinaasciment came and all of the changed and all this great idea; we put the human being to the center of the universe and the mysteries and no longer space to the creatures and no longer and leaving space to the divinity.
This was the principle of humanitual humanity, and people started to think that creativity came completely from the issue of human bear.
And for the first time in history, you began to reference or that artist as a rather than a person with a person with the genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think that allows somebody to believe that a simple person to believe that the found, the essence and the surprising and the surprising of all the mysteries and the ethern mysteries is a movie for human beings to be a movie to human fragile of human beings.
It's like to ask somebody to engineer the sun
Deform, and the completely and creates all these ingestible ingestilive and creates all these expectations on the performance.
And I think it was this pressure to destroy the artists in the pasts of the artists in the past.
And, if this is true, and I think that is, and the question, and now?
Can we do it different?
Maybe we go back to a more understanding of the ancient of human relationship between human and creative creative and mystery creative to it.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't cut 500 years of rational thinking in a rational thinking about 18 minutes.
And there is probably people in the audience that would be related susps in the audiences of scientific notion of the notion of the notion that follow people in the fact that they follow their projects.
I probably won't convince you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to ask is -- why not?
Why don't think about it in this way?
Because it has more sense than any other thing that has ever heard to explain the exxperant impredictable.
A process that as anyone that I tried to do something -- yet, basically, everybody here -- you know, you don't get rationally behavior.
And, in fact, it can seems completely paranormal paranormal paranorm.
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poet Ruth Stone, who has now 90 years old, but it was a poetry for the whole life and told me that during his childhood in the wall, and he was working out in the field, and I heard it in the field of the countrysit -- and I was going to be a poetry for all of the expandscape.
He said that it was like a horful training of the air --
And that was going to roll to her rolling to her landscape.
He heard to get it, because he had to do the ground below his feet.
He knew to have one thing to do to that point and it was to do to that point and he was going to run as a morn."
And it goes to the home and was following by this poetry, and she would not have to do something that take a piece of paper and a pretty quickly and a pretty match and a pretty mark it and and save it on the page.
Other times couldn't be quicked, and he realized and running and corrective and corrective it and the rockets the rocket and she would keep rolling through the landscape and he would keep roll through the landscape and he would keep rolling through the lands."
And then there were those times -- this piece not forget it -- there were moments when the was almost losing in that was almost losing losing --
So, he was running to the house and was trying to paper, and he was looking for a lands and the poetry was in the well that he was going to be as if you would get away with the other hand, and the office hand and the accident.
And he had the poetry from the tail and he put it on the body and it was putting the body and transscrewed on the page.
And in these cases, the poetry would be presented to the perfect and intact meeting and intact to the first make.
So when I heard it -- it's crazy, it's exactly the same same creative process to my creative process to my process process to my process process to my process process.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a convicture.
I'm a mule, and my work to work is to work with the same horary horarian hours and south and work and to work and get it over and spend it on the goff.
But even in my kardage, I sken brought against that thing, sometimes.
And I imagine a lot of you have the han did.
You know, even if the work and ideas and ideas would give me a certain a certain a certain a certain the way I could not be honestly knowing it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we do relate to it in a way that we don't have to lose your head, but it makes to stay sanish?
And as I really, the best example of contemporary that I have the Tom Waits, which I interviewed interviewed years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life has been the mecharged by the contemporary rection, dominate these species of creative impulses of totally interiors.
But then he got to hot and a day and a day while he was driving on a highway to the highway to the highway to him.
He was going to fast and all of a feat that small fragments of melodia, that comes into his head as it does inspiration, elusive and the wants to be wonderful, you know, it's wonderful, and the designed, but it doesn't know how to take it.
It has no piece of paper, has no math, it has no math, it has no madely.
So we start to feel this kind of old old old old growing in him and he can loss, and I'm going to lose and I'll get obsessed by this song lost lost of lost allow.
I'm not enough and I can't do it it to do it.
And instead of going to the panic stoppanic --
It made the whole mental process and made something completely new thing.
And he just looked at the sky, and he said, "Scuse, don't you know, I'm dying up?"
"You seems that can write a song now?
If you really want to exist, you go back to a little more opportunity when I can take care of you.
Other and adments, to add somebody else today.
You go to the Leonard Cohen."
And his working process changed after this.
Not the work, the work was still dark as it always always dark for it.
But the process and the fishing anks that was released when the genius, the genius, the genius, the genius, which was that the problems and free it sent it realizing it was realizing it was realizing that he had to be an interior and the mind.
but well this peculiar beautiful conversation a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that was not Tom.
So as I felt that story began to change a little bit of a way I worked and saved to me.
This idea, saved when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Ama," and fall the fall of the disperation where we fall of the disperation where we're working on something and you can't and start thinking that it will be a disaster, that that that will be a worst book.
Not only bad the worst book, writing writing.
And I started to think about designing this project.
But then I remember from Tom who talked to the air and tried.
So I went to the face on the manufacturing and I would say my comments to a corner of the room.
And I told to you, "You ent, both both both you know, if this book not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not be brilliant, right?
Because as I see a I'm putting to all that I haven't got more about this.
So if you want to be better and, you have to give you a little bit of it.
Okay. But if you don't know, you don't know what it is, I don't myself to it.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to do that was recorded to me that I today is I presented to me to do my part, because -- the end is the one of the North Africa -- -- century the people were sunted to the moon for the long dances of the moon and sacred dances that were going to go to the high of the mosacred and to the alb.
And they were always magnific because the ballers, were professional professions and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic.
But every one of the really, something happened, and one of these artists became in reality became to transcend.
And I know what I know about what I know about it, because I know that you saw all of a point, a performance like that.
It was like the time you sket, and the ballerins walking through a kind of lportal and was not doing anything different from the solution, like 1,000 night before, but everything is all the way to the inef.
And suddenly suddenly as a human human one.
But you accepty from the diline and underneath of the divinity.
And when this happened to the them, the people who knew what was was, they knew what was called his name.
They were coming the hands and they started sing to sing "Allah, God, God, God, God,
That's God, you know.
And the note story -- when the Mors the South the Mors of Spain, they would take this habitude with them and pronune changed in the century of "Oh, Allah, that you still can in the hold, which you still have in the hold, which you still can have in the correclear or the flew or in the flew or in the flew of the flew and the pronuncer of the South of the South and the pronunck of the South South Sppay,
In Spana, when an artist has done something impossible and magic "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, fold."
And it's great because we need it.
But the problem comes the day down, the ballerind itself, when you wake up and discovers that are the 11th of Martedday and the Does of God is not there.
It's just a mortal with a dead to the knee, and maybe it will never be able to get that alteen.
And maybe no one dog will be the name of God even while what to do with the rest of his life?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to do in a creative life.
But maybe not to be so anguy's so angood, if you can not believe it, it is that the most extraordinary aspects of your being coming from you to yourself.
But believe sts that they are given to you give you a squisite that team, you have to get somebody else when you find.
And, you know, if we think in this whole whole whole whole change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought about different months during the lands of the book that I'm going to public book that I'm going to public paper, the dangerous cheap, and I followed my great success.
And what I have to keep on when I feel electricrized by this is, not fear.
Don't fit to your work.
It indees to present you to your parts, whatever can be.
If your work is ball, dance, dance.
If the dive, you know, you get a clear to get some kind of wonderful to get some kind of wonderful things, for one moment through your efforts through your efforts and "Ole!"
Other and you do it the same dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself it.
I think we have to teach it.
"Ole!" to yourself, even for you, even for human love and test talks to to do you continue to do you continueat.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen.
As you know, I already talked about some of these projects on human genome, what can meaning and discovery of genes.
We're starting a new pattern: we started to digitalize biology and now to start from that code code and now from that code code is in a new phase of biology phase and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and now to be a new
We always tried to ask questions.
"What is life happening?" is something that many biologists I think has tried to understand various levels.
We tried to have different approaches, reducing it to the minimes of terms.
We're digitalizing by almost 20 years ago.
When we sequenced the human genome was going to go from the analog world of biology to the digital world.
We wonderful to us to regenerate the life, or create new life from this universe from this universe --
This is the map of a small organism -- the Mycoplasma genome that is the species from the smallest genome in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit smaller.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of the around 500 that are here.
But when we look at the map of the metabolic map of the metabolic, it's relatively simple respect to the now.
I think I was simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimind, one at the time, it's very imlikely that this can bring to a live.
So we decided that the only way to be to synthesize this chromosome that chromosome so that we could modify the components to ask some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the wind of the "Can we synthesize a chromom cromom cromom cromom cromom cromom cromother?"
Can chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never had to create before we haven't able to create before?
And, in case of business we can do a chromosound?
A chromosome, it's just a piece of inert material chemical material chemical material.
The speeds with which we are able to digitalize life is growing up to exponential exponential to the exponential rects.
Our capacity to write the genetic code, progress, but it's better deliver, but it's better better.
And our most results results to the exponential curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has requires a lot of past passages, starting with a bioetic review of the first experiments.
But we discovered that synthesize DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines to the world that produce small segments of DNA, the length of 30 to 50 to the length and it's a degenerative processing is longer than the segment is longer than the segment is longer than the size of the world that they have a degenerative process.
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and rors rors.
And this was our first attempt to start by the digital information of Phi X 174.
It's a small virus that bacteria.
We designed the errors and made the correction of the errors and got a molecules of DNA molecules of about 5,000 letter of about 5,000 letter of about 5,000 letter of DNA in about 5,000 feet.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inert material chemical material chemical chemical and we put it into the batters started to read this genetic code and producing the virtural particles.
The virals are then released by cells, they were back from the cell and they destroy back and destroy the E.
I talked about recently with recently members of the oil industry says, they certainly understood this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where software can really build his own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the most in bigger things.
We wanted to build the whole battery.
It's more than 580,000 letting genetic code.
So we thought we build it in the size of viruses, so that we could change the cassets to understand what the cassets are a living cassets of a living casset.
The design is crucial information and if we start with digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995, the accurateful standard was a mibasic error for every 10 mistakes it up.
We discovered it, 30 error sequence, 30 error sequence we would never be able to do it.
One part of the process is designing along the 50 letter that they overled with all the other segments of 50 letters to build undermine to build subunts to build subunits of smaller than working together.
We can do the unique elements here.
You probably read that we read the filige.
Think about it. We have a genetic code genetic code on four letter: A, C, GGs and T.
Three of those letters together and code about 20 friends, and there's a specific order to reading for every admino-to-led gays.
So we can use genetic code to write words, though.
What we did about the beginning is automobile to the beginning to be self-supping it.
Some of them have been deuses from the fact that it was not poetry.
We designed these segments to just just to join them with my own own own things.
There are enzymes that repair them and put them together.
And we started assembling the particular of the parts, starting with five to seven miles, one of them to form 24 miles of the lects, the letters of the letter.
And every step we produced these segments in abundance so that we can sequence, that we're trying to create a very extreme tremely robbbastop -- as you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to automatizing the process.
So, this seems to be the table, it seems to be a basket.
When we get to these very long, they will not grow more than 100 miple will not grow more directly in E. cool.
You get to the limits of the modern tools of the molecular biology.
So we consider other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called a omologists that are in biology that in biology to reployee the DNA to reployees of the segments.
Here's a example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radio ccus to be absorbing three million radiation.
You can see in the high school require like his chromosome,
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly how before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be able to be completely several it.
They can live under empty.
They're absolutely certain that life exists in space, and you move to find new environments.
As the NASA showed that this living lives.
This is a picture of the molecular that we built using these process, just using the lievidence with the design appropriate design appropriate to inserious segments to inserious seats.
The lievit assembly them self-atically.
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope, but with a rular microscope microscope microscope with a regular microscope microscope.
It's a molecular molecules that we can see it with a law microscope.
These are pictures that covering a period of about six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago.
It's more than 58,000 lectures code genetic code.
It's the biggest molecules of a defined structure that has ever created by man.
It has a weight molecular high school in a 300 million of them.
If we are going to spend a ten naked 10 without spaces, there would be 142 pages to get this genetic code.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we activate it?
Of course, you can see a virus is a girls.
It's a little more complicated when they use batter.
It's also simpler when it's the euucariot cells like our re: you can simply the nucleus and put another high and put another high and insert that is basically the process of clon.
In the archaea chromosome, the chromosome, but we recently recently recently recently that we are able to do a complete traplant of a cell cross-cromosome, and activate it.
We can reficiated a partnership from a microbial species.
The two are different than men are different from the tough men are different than the men are of them.
We added some genes in a way that we decide that we decide to chromosoin for this chromosoin
And it was skilled with the people in a way to kill all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cells of the cell was wondering -- and you appreciate our so-cromosome, the new chromosome, the new chromosome, the new cell phone.
And we started thinking we couldn't go beyond it, but we tried to be pushed to the beyond there.
This is one of the most exchanisms of evolution.
We discovered that very much species have added a second or a third chromosomes from some hand, in a thousands of new tracks to that species.
So who think about evolution as a gene of a gene to be a lot of biology.
There are gain of the restriction of restrictions is that addicts DNA.
The chromosome, that was in the cells that was in the cell that it was in the cell that was in the cell that was in the cell that was in the cell that was in cell.
The cell phone -- the cromosome, we have insert --
It's expressed, and recognized the other chromosome, and we have masticked it with just the cell and we have a cross-new chromosoun.
It's became blue to the genes that we put it.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a kind of a kind of a new species, and it turned from the new species, which we put it into a new species, which we put in the cell phone.
All the protein are changed, the membranes are changed, and when we read the genetic code of the equivalent that we have transferited you.
Now, this could look at the alchemiia but altering the software DNA we can change the things in manier.
Now, I already explained that you don't talk about gene -- but of progress from three and a half evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's enough to be obvious when we think about our necessity.
We're going to spend six billion and a half of nine billion in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946, there are going to be four.
We're going to have a problems now to find food, water and clean and clean and benzinal bas, and benzinal gass for six billion and a half half of it.
It's going to be harder for nine billion.
We can lize more than five carbon dibon dies of olies.
It means a day.
When we try to find biological processes or or any kind of process to replace them to replace them, it's going to be a huge challenge challenge.
And in the more of all of the CO2 emission of all the emission of the materials that end up in the atmosphere.
At the day of the today, thanks to the scientific discovery that in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are designed for the future.
The electronic industry has only a dozen dozen of components, and think about how many different things came out.
Our limits here are data principles from reality and our imagination.
We now have a techniques, thanks to these rapid methods that are able to create what we call combined.
We are able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
Think about process these 20 million different genes or to try to get the processes to get the processes to get optimize or drugs, and we can change and make more biology than in the last 20 years, and create biology biology now that in the last 20 years.
And it's simply a standard.
We can choose for possibilities of survival, producing chemistry or carbon and carbonons, producing ethcs.
This is a few software programmed with which we're working to be able to seat, and designing species to the design design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they will be no.
We know exactly what the genetic code.
We're focusing on the carbons of quarter generation.
You can see that you can extract ethanol from the grant to be a finished experiment.
We have a second floors of second and third generation that will use enough lder, sugar to the highest fuel like eight or different kinds of higher as the eight of different types.
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing the cost of food and limiting the cost of food and limiting the diavability would be transforming CO2 in the primous, whose cell that we're working to designing this stuff that can reach, and we think we could have a primouseholds of four-months.
The sunlight with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries all over the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
He lives in the deep ocean deep about 2,500 feet of echarges of the water.
It creates the CO2 using molecular as a molecular of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can get CO2, which can be a easily transported transported through your carbon that CO2 in the carbant, to guide this process.
So we think that short we could be able to increase what the basic question, "What the basic is Now, truth, real -- we have the goal of oil oil is not replace to replace the oil industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do?
It would become a main of energy.
And even we're working to use the same methods to create vaccines.
You saw this year with influence, we're always background back a year and a dollar, in less when it's treatment to find the right vaccine the right of the right year.
I think that that is changing building vaccinable to change combinable in an anticips.
That's how the future could start to begin to seem to change it, the tree of evolution, acceling evolution, accelerating the evolution, and then cells -- and then the eucarian clusters, and then cells cells.
We are so much from the best to improve people.
Our purpose is to live long-to live to try to do it. Thank you very much.
First of all I'm going to do you see, the most possible, a fundamental work that we took to Microsoft in the followed to a year ago to a year ago exactly. This is Seadragon.
It's a environment that you can interact is a local levels that remote with a huge amount of visual data --
And here we're seeing a lot of gabytars of digital photos with a kind of coast and continue, to a speed sand-up, saying the images as we want to do the images as we want to like it.
And it doesn't matter how great information is the amount of information that we see -- how big these data or images.
Most of them are digital photographs, but this for example is a comprovision from Bilibrary of Congress, and it comes into the gam, and it comes into the gam, and it comes into the gam, and it comes into the gam.
It does no difference because the only thing that the only thing the prestations of a system like this is the number of the skin any moment. It's also a very flexel of architecture.
This is a book interning, example of data not images.
This is the Dickens. Every Casa desolater of Dicks. Every column represents a capitly.
To show you that it's a text of test and you can do something like that, to do something like that, to see really that it's a real representation of the text representation of the text of the text -- not a picture.
It could be a little artificial way to read a book electronic book.
You don't consider.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian of the Guardian example of the Guardian example of the Guardian examp.
Every image is the beginning of a section.
And it really gives you the pleasure of read the very experience of a newer or a newer view or a quotidian or of a quotidian experience of a quote type of a half a type of a quote type of a quote or a net sense of a net or a ne
We also did something with the angle of this particular Guardian angle of Guardian --
We created a high advertising audience -- much higher than what it is using in a normal advertising -- and we put it in the normal content -- and we put it of the extra.
If you want to see the characteristics of this self-bile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific specific techniques.
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen.
We hope that this means to put pop on and other similar charges and other similar to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose a time if not to say that we have contributes to give it this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. obpaatial image of NASA.
So now we go to something else.
This is actually from living on the web; you can go to the web; you can see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which combine two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a research of a very interesting research, a student of the University of Washington, with the aid of Steve Seitz of Washington, with the U.S. and Resear. Seitz of Microsoft Resear. See Research.
And it's from Seadragonished by Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen where we can go from a picture to the other kind of experience to the other kind of experience to multiply resolution to the other kind of experience to the multiple.
But the space of the pictures here has actually actually actually a meaning.
The U.S. Roccises of the computer recorded these images together, so that they run to the real places that short -- all the neighborhood to the Grashes on the Grashi Grashs of Roccislides are stable to of a slides of a slides of the space. And these things are all colleagues of imaging space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some more space than space --
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noah-- and this comes from a previous prototynthosynthosynthosynthetic -- to show you what I think is really the key to show you what I think is really the key to the key of the website. And it's not necessarily very evidence that we put in the website.
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on.
This is a rebuilding of the Notre Dame is a pictures from Flickr. Basta digiting Dame in Flickr and you get images of the types of the cleaning campus and so on. Either one of these conies and so on. Either one of these arangers represents a model.
So they all picked up by Flickr and they were all connected to the space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never think about to end up to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratify to get this kind of nice to get this kind of narrange.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of different types of the phones in the SLR, a meaning number of the SLR, a significant number of meaningful phones in this environment.
And if you can try to do that strange the strange.
Many are they blocked by down, etc.
Somewhere a few part here is a series of photographs and -- -- etch of it.
This is a Notre poster of Notre Dame recorrectly.
We can go from the poster of the poster view of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do with social environment. This is now taking from the whole memory of how it appears the Earth, from view of view -- and colleagues all those data together.
All of those are becoming together, more than the sum of the particular parts.
You have a model of the whole model that emerge.
Think about this as the Stephen Lawless work,
It's something that grows in complexity as as people us, and the advantages for who useful people to use the use.
Their pictures are marked with other people.
If somebody is the idea of contransfer all these kinds of people saying the name of Notre Dame improvisely Dame improvisely recognize all of those data, and I can use the engine, and I can use as a data that in the universe that in the universe of anybody else's space, in that universe, using the same sort of recross-mok-smok-smok-s' experience of smodel.
Of course, a consequence of all this is virtual virtual models of all interesting in the land, hard-sit views and satellitarian and satellitarian and satellitarian and the memory of collective satellitaries and similar of the collective views of the planet.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood OK? What your software will have to do is that at some point, in the next few years in the next few years in the next years, all the photographs and shared from anybody in the whole world will be practically connected together?
BA: Yeah. What's going to do is basically discovering.
He's creating hyperlins, if you want to be -- if you want to be, between images.
And he's doing it based on the content of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealthy of information that many of these can have a lot of these images possibly education.
As when you do a research of images on the web, you told a sentence and the head has a lot of information about the pictures of the picture.
Now, what if that picture is connected to all your photos to all your photo?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of rechemical interconnection of the retle. It's a classical effect of the rete.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible. Compliments.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the main of the main of the major research of the research of the research of the ancient who didn't forget the antic to the antic traditions, in the wind of the ragiven of the ragiven of the ragiven of the ragiving plants.
You think that Jaguarl Jaguararl is traveling still beyond the Milky Way, or the ancient myths are still meaningful of meaningful -- budddholding the respire of the Dharma, to remember the reminds of the reminds that we live live to the central anthropolooogic anthrope, and the idea that we don't exists in the sense of reality, but it's just a model of reality,
the consequence of a particular choices that our stirps that our stirps has done or myself generations ago.
And, of course, we all share the essential trates.
We all come to the produce of it.
We are subjects to begin action.
We have to deal with the inexorse of dead, so we don't surprised if we get out --
We have a art of it.
What it is particularly is the particular of the rhythm of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Forest of the Borneo, or the Voodoo Voodoo World Worriors of the Kenya sectonal warriors of the Sahara.
He was my journey companies in the desert of journey in the desert of yak in the vallevidence of Qomolang, the mother den Everest, the mother of the world.
All of these populations that there are other ways of thinking, there are other ways to think about other ways to think about other ways of moving in the world.
And, if you reflect a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
And as we can see, the miridge of cultures of the world create a spiritual and cultural life that has been a biosphering and it's important for the well-being of the planet and it's important for the planet as biosphere.
And you can think about this rather cultural as an ethnose and you can define the ethnose. And you can define the ethnosing of all the concepts, dreams, dreams, and intuition intuition from human half the ala of consciousness of consciousness of consciousness --
The ethnos: The evidence of humanity.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in the inquisite inisitive inisitive inisitive inism.
And because the biosphere has been free consumed as a consumed as much rapidly as much quicker.
No biologist, for example, would say 50 percent of all the species has been or on the beautimic extinction -- in the most apocality, or the most apocality, and not near the near of biological diversity -- and not even near the most optimistic diversity.
The indedication of all of this is, of course, the loss of language.
When you were born languages in this planet.
One language is not just by a vocabulary or from a series of rules of gramular rules of gramm.
One language is the spraying of human spirit spirit --
It's the means that animal culture comes into the material world comes into the material.
Every linguished is a forest of mind, a thinker, a thinking, a thinking, a spiritual system.
And of those 6,000 languages, while we're sitting here in Monterey, at least half is not going to be swallowed in the ears.
They don't be teached to the children, whatever it means that you don't change something, which is already dead.
What is more than being folks than being folks from the silence, of being the last to talk a language of being tape to transmit the wisdom of the children?
This is a state of a fabe of somebody in the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks a welder and it door and it door and it door and it door in the last sillabe of a ancient language.
And I know that somebody is going to tell you that somebody of you will say, "Is it it do?
The world would not be a better place, if we all talk about the same languaga?" Benish syno, then we talk yoruba.
Let's talk about kogies.
You will be able to talk about a tract what it means you can't talk about your language.
And I would like to do a journey through the ethnos:
a small view in the ethnosphere to give you a sure of what we're losing.
Many of us forget that when I say, "different different different ways of existers, I mean, I'm really different ways of exists.
Let's take for example, this birth, in Amazony Amazon the Scentrill, which creates to the mit of the military bread of the military bread of the milk of the sacridging sacris.
It's a population that is not able to distinguishing the blue blue color, because the time the celests is identified in the forest, which is identified by which is the popular popular popular popular popular color.
They have a strange language and a regular rule, called language, "languagos language, you have to get a person who talks about a different person who talks about a different language.
And all of this has radicated in the past, the particularity is that in these families that are talking about six or seven languages that are talking about six or seven languages because no practice of a language.
They listening to listening to and then start talking about.
Let's take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived in the Waorani Haoranan unbelievable population that had the first contacts in 1958.
In 1957, five missionaries have tried a contact mistake.
They made up from the photographs that were retled to the very very much that they would return them into the plug forest that this popular of the plug forest had never seen anything while had ever seen anything bizero-dimensional population had never seen anything about the bizero-dimensional resources.
They collected the ground, they turned to the research of a shape or a figure and they kill the five that was the diavold, they kill the beef of the beef of the mission with the size of the laws.
But Waoranan didn't kill the strange to the strangers.
They kill them in between them.
Five percent of the mortality was caused by them stick.
We have risalites to eight generations and we found two natural cases and when we insisted for knowledged that one of them was a such that they died that they died that they died himself it. And then they kill it killed himself in the incredible forest.
The hunters were able to recognize the animal of the urina, and recognize the species.
In the first 1980s, I was assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard professor of Harvard was asking me if I wanted to go to intrupholarms to the base of Duvalier and TontMacoutes, and I could implemented with the zombies.
To give a sense of miracle, I should understand Vodoun culture, Vodoun and that the Voodoo is not a nera.
It's very much of a complex metahaphysics of the world.
Very interesting.
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world, what would you say?
Cristian Islam, Buddhistory, Buddy, etc.
A continent is always left out, and thinking that sub-Saharan Africa-Saharan Africa-religious and the Voodoo is not that the distilled of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of nuted slavery of the slavery.
What makes interesting is the intense is the intense of life and dead.
So you live to make the spirits.
You know, you can be invocated by the Great Aqua, they respond to the dance of the dance and replace to the dance of the way that live to the soul of the way that a short of the following becomes the dio.
So the voodoodoodoodoodor to talk to the church of God.
We dying in the temple, and we become God."
And from the moment that you're going to be a driven you, how can you do the male?
So you see these incredible events of these incredible events of trance events that touch infures infuocated a rather strong demonstration of the mind when it's catalyzed in a state of exciting in a state of exciting in a state of exciting exciting in a state of exciting excited in a state of excited excited in a state of exciting demonstration events.
And all the popules with whom I lived the most extraordinary Kogi World World War, in the Santa Mara, in the Santa Mara, in the secten Colombia.
Feews of the ancient civilization that when they live on the floors of Colombia in the population attention to the conquister was going to the vulcanic and the vulcanic planurs.
In a blood lady of blood that popular continents has never been conquered by spagnos.
At the today are governed by a clerd, but their formation is decided.
The young people followed from the families to three or four years and they live in a good world of bug and shadow in a world of the glaciers for 18.
Two nine years of choices to reproduce the nine months of the gestation that spent the mother, they are metaphory of the mother, I'm metaphory of Great Mad.
So this time, they are acculate to the values of their societies that predict that their prayers and only their praying and only their praying the cosmic balance -- or to say the balance -- or to say the balance ecological ecological equilibrium.
And in the end of this incredible initiation, they are suddenly carried out and for the first time in life at the age of 18, they see a high alb. And in that active awareness of the first cutter of the beautiful backy's beautiful and the beautiful of the beautiful ling all his own sendor, all his pretty much beautiful and says,
"Right? Prore as I said,
It's wondering. Now it's going to protect this."
They call the biggest brothers and say that you know, brothers are the flight of the world.
This is extremely important.
When we think about indigenous populations and the environment, we would involved Redwood story of the wild history of the wild of the wild simplicity or maybe intain the Earth or maybe we think these popules are closer to the Earth of us.
The indigenes are not feeling feelings or indebuled by our algies.
There is no space for these things in the Asmat the Asmat or wind gelies of the Tibet, but because of time and they created a mistick of the Earth based on the concept of the Earth is not about the concept of it. But in a well-basic intuition that the Earth: the concept that the Earth can be because it's infusing from human consciousness --
What does it mean?
It means a And, who is growing grows that grows is a spirit of the mountain is a spirit Apu that will be a deep human being deeply and will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place to be a very different respect to a respect of Montana bag of Montana by-scaved mountain is a masse of cavel that you can be able to be a deeply scaven.
Whether it's a dimore, or a mineral mineral is irrilevel.
What is interesting is the metaphor, which defines the report between individual and the natural world.
I grew up in the forests of Columbia creding that the forests service to be cutting forests to be cute.
And what has made me a different human friends from my friends Kwakiutl that create that the forests are the Hukukuk and the wind-history of the paradisease, and the wind-house and spirits that live in the world of the world, spirits that are deal with the beginning of the Hamatsa.
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality to start understand some of them of the sense of them to be a sensational. Let's take this plant.
I took this picture to open in the normal Amazon the normal Amazon the Western Amazon.
Maybe some of you have heard about ayahuasca, the most powerful psycho-reperto-reperto-reperto-reperto-reperto-clean ayhuax, the most powerful psychoice.
What makes it fascinating ayahuas, is not the macological potential of sustance, but its elaboration. It's composed by two elements.
On the side, this lian lian lian that has a series of beta-carbine, harmine and harbly harm, slightly hallucine, slightly hallucinner.
Proll the only plant is a bluear that alters a little bit of the consciousness, but it's mixed with the leaves of a house of the family of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the family of the coffee coffee of the coffee caffee of the family of the fall the shef of the family of the slies of the reear fall the fall the fall the hily of the butterness, but but but but but but but but but but but but but but is
This is a trip of trips that very similar to the servotonina, dimetho-five methoddamine-methoxime,
If you ever see the Yanomami to you can get to the nose of the substance that they do from different species of species, in a different species of species, in a half conties methoxietime.
To that pole for the nose is a little bit like being shot from a sparked sparked from barockes, and landing on a sea of electricity. It's not create a distorsion of reality. It's not create a distortion of reality.
I had often had often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who had done the psychedelic, with his discovery of hallucins in the 1930s in the 1930s in the '30s in Mexico.
Second my testhesis you can't classrooms like hallucinoxies like halluciny, because if you can't tell anybody where.
It's possible to assumption, only if they assumptions with other chemices that money money with MAO.
Now it's the beauti: the beautiful carbins, which is in this lian inhibiters, the same kind of necessary to potentiate trial to potentiate trial to potentiate trial to potential to the trip of 80,000 species of plants, like these popules are not like these popular dead, but if you indeed in this ways, but if you indead to the subject that is subject to the submitself of the particular things?
We use the great euphemism and the error, that can be revealed to be revealed with it.
But if we ask Indians, they will tell us "The plants to talk to us."
What does it mean?
This tribe, Cofan, has 17 varieties of ayhuas, which is born that distinguished in the forest, and that to our eyes would come into the same species.
If we ask them how they stabilish their taxonomy will tell us "I think we got plants, the rest of the rest of the rest of you know?
The solution is, they take the 17 varieties in a night of the moon and each dog and each dog with a different tun.
With there is no degree to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to count the estern stames.
Now, the problem is that also the ones that are also that the people who have heart to the indigens are pitches and in some way to the marine world in the history of the reals, and spends found it in the reals, and spends found it.
In fact, the XX century, between 300 years, it will not be remembered for his innovations or innovations or innovations that we are stopped and abbraced and we have hope and we have hope to get the destruction of biological diversity and cultural diversity. Now Now the destruction is not the change.
All cultures through the century have been involved in a dance for new possibilities.
And the problem is not technology.
The Sioux Indians have no brought to be Sioux when they put part of the Americans are not stopped to be when they put part of Americans and hot horse and hot horse and hot horse and hot them.
It's not the change or the technology that threats of the ethnosphere. It's the point.
The flight of domination.
And if you give you a look at the world, you discovered that these are not destined to disappear.
They're living and dynamics and dynamics out of the existence of the existence that will be beyond their ability of adaptation.
What you can see you expect in the patric of the Pen--
a popular now, Sarawak, in South Asian East population who lived in the forest of the real-up generation and the reduce to the service and the reserves on the rivers of the river, where you can see the river, where you can see the river, where you can see the river, where you can see meets mean to the record of the Eastern Can inese Merdiontte, where the navaaponte, where the orizontttext Meronte,
You can release the styping styping the wood of the forest.
Or in the case of the Yanomers, are the diseases that are coming with the behind discovery of the hor.
If we move on the mountains of the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research, you see the last.
As you know the genocide, the physics of a popular population, but the ewalks, the destruction of the life style of a popular population, not just convicted in the popular of the lifestyle of developing in certain environments, because it does part of developing the developing of developing developing a bedrowing of developing beds.
And you can't understand the suffering of Tibet until you start in the beginning.
I have spent 6,000 miles from China, in the Western China occient through Tibet to Lhasa with a young then, and the reaching of the colleage, but only came to Lhase, and I realized the statistics that we heard able.
6,000 world's sacred world's sacred to the sacred and cenergy.

The Tree of the Tibet can be unbet redent, but the reverse of the popular is to keep present.
At the end, everything is reduced to a choice.
We want to live in the world of the world's monotony or we want to get the polyyromatic world of different?
The great anthropologig Mead, before he died her greatest fear was that in our model, in our world, just will not just see the whole range of human imagination of human imagination that human imagination of human imagination that was a modth of thinking, but a day we will see it from a sleep.
And it's humiliating to remember that our species is for 600,000 years of a handle of them.
The Revolution of Neolitics, which has given us to have the class of seed that the seed of the seeds of the slip with the slim of the class, creating the gerarchia gerarchia gerarchia of the specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern world has at the 300 years.
That shark sky shark that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with the millennia to come to the millen.
When these myridge cultures of the world is asked what it wants to be human beings, respond with 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all will be the chance of being what we are.
I took this picture on the north of Breader of Baffin, when I went to the whales of Breaist with Inuit, and this man was told me the wonderful story of his grandfather.
The government canadese is not always just, with the Inuit and in the '50s to stable to re-stable reins in colonies.
The grandfather, the grandmothers refused to go with it.
The family, temping for his life, he took all the arms, and all his attres.

We want to talk about the resident with nothing?
In the opened 19999 the California has redated to the Ent control of a territory of the largest California and Texas the California and Texas the together.
It's their new patria. It's called Nunavut.
It's a territory. They are all the minerary resources of minerary resources.
One beautiful example of how a country of a country can reconciliar with his popular people.
And, finally, I think it's pretty obvious at least at least to the people who have been in these remote areas of the planet, realized that they don't remote remote.
For somebody is home.
They represent sections of human imagination that they risaling to the high dails. And for us all these kids, like the dreams of our children, become part of our children, become part of the hope.
Finally, we are National Geographic is convinced that politicians will never get anything to do about anything.
We believe that polemies --
[Applausive are not persuasive, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we're the best institutioning the stories of the world. Every month in the world. Every month in the world has got 35 million visites.
156 countries turn our television is to our television.
Our reviews are literally from millions of people.
Our work is to travel to bring our audience in places to the evidence of cultural wonders from which they are going to be able to see how they saw you've seen hope, abbracing the central world market -- the central world market -- and we have to find a style of life in a place in a place in a place in a world world in a place in a place world in a place in a place in a place of place in a world world in a place in a world of place,
in which the wisdom of all the popules can contribute to our well-being collective.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some of the things I wrote in this book that I hope I hope to reach other than you have heard and to try to evidence a collegment, in the case not the notaste.
I want to start with what I call "the dogmaster dog,
The office dogma dog,
The dogmaster of all the Western societies of the Western industrial societies, "If we want to massive the well-being of our citizen" "The way to do is to male libert."
The reason for a side, in the fact that liberty is in the fact that the freedom is precious, essential essential beings.
On the other is that if we're free, each of us can act to do everything that is to do about what massive to do everything that is about our well-being, without any of name our well-being, without any of our well-being,
The way to massive liberty is to massive liberty is to male choice.
More choices people have, more liber, the more is their liberty, and the freedom is their well-being.
This is so deeply, it's so deeply that no one dream of the society that no one would be dreamed to put it into the doube.
And it's also deeply deeply in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big.
I allowed a simple named on the condition for hall.
In my supermarket are 175 conments, without contaring 10 varieties of oil oil and 12 awful acets of oil and 12 acets across the skets you can get a huge number of condments in the circumstancy of the circumstances of your degree is of your degreenhough of your degreat.
That's how the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic store, to buy a stere: cassroom lector lector readers CD, radio printing.
And in this single store, there's a great number of audio components.
We can do six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in a store.
You have to admit that there's a lot of choice.
Other than the world of communications.
Once I was a child to get all the services for all the services for the clear telephone would be wide with the clear mom Bell.
He was now, you read the phone -- they didn't buy it.
One consequence of that, between the phone that was that the phone doesn't break the phone is not going to roll it.
These are the time to it.
Now we have a varieties almost illitated variety of telephones, especially between the cell phones.
Here's the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle, the MP3, cutting eli and the form in the nose.
If you have no case you have seen in the submart, you're going to be beyond you have seen to be revering it will be going to be reaching to be reversely revery.
And what the end happens that people in the stores and does this question. And you know what the answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much and
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than waters, it is the same explosion of choices.
Assistance, not going to happen, in the United States that you go from doctor and the doctor you what you have to do.
And you go to the doctor, and the doctor says, "Okay, could we do A, or B" "As it has these goodd goods, and these risks, "Bs have these risks. What do you want to do?"
You say, "Dr, what should I do?"
And the doctor says, "As it has these goods, and Bs has these risks, and the risk."
"What do you want to do?"
And you rebat, "Dr, if she was what to do do?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not le."
We call it "the autonomy of the autonomy, expression that it makes it seems a nice thing.
But it is not that a move to move the weight and responsibility of taking decisions from somebody who knows anybody else -- and so not in the doctor, and so not in the ideal condition to somebody else -- and so not in the idea to take the patient.
There is a huge marketing products of pharmaceutical products to people like me and you, that if you think has no sense, that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, why do we public them?
The answer is that they want to doctor to ask them to ask them to ask them to recise the recip.
Something that is our identity like our identity is a choice, as you see in this soul view of the children. We don't want to force the right moment. They're not going to be more than the right moment. We don't want to get a identity: we have to invent.
And we can reinvent how many times we can get it.
Which means that every morning to the risk of the rise, you have to decide that kind of person wants to be.
Respt to the family and marriage, a long time prospective -- under the pound of everyone was that you had to get the most pretty soon as possible.
The only real choice was with choice was with then, not the way to do later.
Today, everything is really to play.
I teach them very intelligent students, and I think about 20 percent of work than a long time.
And because they are not brilliant, because they are not less diligent.
But why are they impensive to ask you, I would ask you, "I should get marrie or now? I should do it now?"
"I have to get marry more tardies? I have to think about before the kids or to career?"
They're interrogatives --
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implements don't completely completing compites and not get a good vote to my exam.
And they have to do it. They're really important questions about it.
Now, the work: we're lucky, like Carl arl net because technology allows us to work every day, from every day, from every day, from every day, from the Hotel Randolph.
To parents, there's a angle, and I'm not going to tell anybody what, where WiFi works.
I don't say that, because I want to use it.
What does that an incredible freedom to choice that we have about the work? Is that we have to decide, if we have to work or not.
We can go to the ball of the ball, with the cell phone in a tas, the Blackberry in the other, and the news, the kney theles.
And even though they're all frightenes, every minute that we see our son to switch, we're also asking it, "I have to answer to this call?"
"I have to answer this email? I have to ablear this letter do?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of your child very different than what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of the things and large things, little things, and big, life is a question of life, life is a question of choice.
Once the world was this: Oh, there were some choice, but it wasn't a question of choice.
The world today is like this: Can is a good thing or negative to the negative or negative need?"
The answer is the Shool of the answer is the Shim.
The positive side of them all of them, so I'm going to talk about the negative ons.
All this choice has two negative effects on people.
The first one, paradoxiety is that it produces instead of free instead of free that liber.
With a lot of options that you choose to do it.
I give you an example meaning: a study of meaning: a study of volunteers.
A colleagues had access to the data of Vank of the Vansed, the giant of though, with about a million clients of clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the more and more desion, the percentage of the 2cent.
With 50 funds, there's 10 percent of less than 10, in less than they are available only 5. Why?
Because with 50 funds that you choose with which choice, is detail, and the choice comes to the inition is remained to questions.
And asks, and asking questions, and of course, questions and questions not going to be there.
You know, you know, that it's not just that these workers to the workers will be able to have enough food for cannot be money enough money -- it also means that decision is that they lost the fundamental of the data of the work.
They don't have to participath them, they losing up to the work, which would be well will, that would be able to put them to cut them.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having choices.
And I think it makes the world like this.
"And finally, for the ethernity: ketchopopop, or maion?"
You would be to take the right decision if it's for ethness, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong wrong and neps the wrong condition wrong in the wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis, and we end up the end of the result of how we would be states that we would be states with less options that are going to be in the hands.
And this for different reasons.
One of them is that with a lot of condition of which is that you would have to choice, and it's not perfect and it's not perfect to be better choice, which is that the alternative that would be better. And what happens is that the alternative imagined it in the hands of choice, and the sodiminum of choice, and the sodiminise of the record of the decision that you would have been present by decision.
even when it was a very good decision.
More choice, the more choice, the more than whatever details that it's insodsatisfacing of option.
And even the one one that economists called expensive opportunity.
Dan Gilbert clearly well stamp like value that we have to depend on what we confrontive things that we compared in.
And in the rocket when there are many options to represent the alternative of the alternative options of the alternative options that are choice.
Here's a example. I example. I example.
But it's what you probably think you probably probably do.
There is this couply to Hamptons.
A place of luxid.
Spiden beautiful journs. It's all about them.
It doesn't eat all. But what he thinks is, "Well, maldities, it's Augosto."
"Everyone of my neighbors in Manhattan are alia."
"I could talk to the front of the front of it."
And it pass two weeks away from the idea that it's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking -- the cheeating where you want to go.
The expensive opportunity decreases for what we have, even when the choice has been excellent.
And the most are the options that we have to consider the more characteristics will be returned to us as a expensive expensive to the result of opportunity.
Here's another example.
This view a lot of things.
It talks about the moment, and maybe live to live slow.
But the most important point is that whatever you choices you choose you choose not to do others.
The things that we don't choose have a four that can make less attempt to make less attention.
Tero point: it's a growing of the expectations.
I tried on my skin buy a new jeans.
I think about almost always jeans.
Once the jeans were just a type, they were bought and the dreams, were dissimis, they were dissimis, they were comfortable to get them and worked a lot of flying a lot of times, they started to go good.
So I went to buy a new couple of a new jeans, and said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cutting cute."
The burns said, "You want to slim fold, ashit, ashit, and asked them up?"
Do you want to do you to the certain the bottonies? "Worled" or ""Is it it does?
"Liken you want to the streams?"
"Sots them wants to the large or strety? Big -- -- Continuating elenses to elencare.
I was in the under and after a little I managed to say, "I want the kind of cheap, which was the only guy -- that was a only guy that I was so for a hour -- so I tried to come out of jeans, and then I came out of the negotid, with the best jeans that I had been a best jeans that I had gone had to be able to have.
It was the major of the best. With I had the best.
But I felt worst I feel worse --
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worst is that with all that choice was that with all of my aspectations were to be perfectly altissue were perfects.
I had expectations of minimes. I didn't expect anything about exceptional exceptional -- but when you have 100 different than 100 different types, at least a guy would be perfect.
What I had water was good, but not perfect it.
After I had to talk to what I was trying to insumption with what I was trying to confront to expectations.
The add of options in life of people don't do that increasing the expectations that these have respects,
And this will produce less soddisfation, even when the results are good.
No one in the world of marketing it makes it.
Because if you know it, you won't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
"You were better when you were worse was worset to the worst of the motive, which was the worst when he was worst when it was worst was going to be possible to meet the surprising surprising surprising pleasant when you was worse was going to be able to meet the surprising of the surprising the worst
Today, in the world where we live -- opulglings, industrialized with the expectancy -- the maximum that we can hope is that things are to be able to hope is that things are to waits.
You never surprised to be surprising because your expects, my expectations, they are involved in it.
The secret of happiness -- what you are here -- is "Baspectack" "Yes, you want to do it -- "Yes, you want it."
I mean, little bit of a hobiographic moment, which is really married married and it's really wonder.
I couldn't do it better, I didn't have a bad better,
But you don't always have to be a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of buy jeans comfortable when there's only that jeans is that when you have no resimilar soddden you, "Why?"
Who is responsible?" "Which is clear.
The world is the responsible. What could I do about that?
When you are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a satisface that you have the responsible responsible is the responsible of the responsible is the responsible that the responsible you are you.
You could do it better.
With hundreds of varieties available, there are no excuse of the insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even if the result is the result is a result and give the satisface and dams the same.
In the last few years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think a meaning factor -- not the unique, but -- of this is not the unique, but people have depression of depression is very high deludge deludges are too high.
And when they have to explain this situation think that the cool.
So the final result is that in general we're better, objectively, but we feel worse --
Let me tell you that you remember it.
This is the office, the office, what we all take for good and it's completely falso.
There is no doubt that a little bit of choice, you don't have a lot better not to be a lot better than a little bit.
There is a critical value, magic value. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have overwhelmed by a piece of the level that the best choices that they get our lives.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost finished from the political point of view, the follow.
What it allows all this choice in the industrial societies is the material recheet.
There are many places in the world, and you know about a lot of places that problem is not that have too choice.
The problem is that they have too poet.
So the fact that I'm talking about is a bad to be a modern of modern modern societies.
And what makes and arrabing is this: Steve Levitt evitt tells you about yesterday than those expensive seats and displayers for birth are inuseful. It's a spread.
I mean, to say that these choices, complicated and dispendous, it's not just useful.
They're the deleters.
They make it worse worse --
If a little bit of what in our societies allows a lot of choice was reversed in those where people have too poors have too poor, it would not just be their lives to improve but even naway --
This is what economists call a paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian
One ridiculation of the reddate is well in -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice that comes back.
And to conclude it is, you can become all that you want to be --
You know, people are culture, you think about it -- "What does that weigh weigh?"
"It's obvious that you can't do anything in a vetron of the vetro."
"A fall, a clear view of the world."
and I check it to the beginning.
But then, I think about it, I realized that weighs the long.
Because the fact of the facts is that if you keep in franks, and so that "everything is possible" is not the freedom to get the paralysis.
If you break the mouth in a way that you can become the sodden deft.
You acceptule paralysis, and you reduce the well-being.
Everybody needs a sphere.
This is almost certainly too strect, perhaps even for us.
But the absence of some sphere is a recipe for the infectious indancy for the instance, for the road.
Thank you very much.
