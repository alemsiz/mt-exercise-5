And last year, I showed these slides to show that the calculation of the artical heat at that time, for almost three million years has had the size of the 48 United States of the United States of the 40 percent.
But this undervalue of the problem because it doesn't show the gravity of the ice problem because it doesn't explain the ice.
The art of the artic heat is, in a sense, the heart of global climate system.
You get out of inversion and return into the summer.
The next slide is going to be a quick carrelled on the last 25 years.
The ice lost of them in the red of the red-too.
As you see, they expand they expand blue to the scuro.
And that's the ice in the inver, which is return into the summer.
You can see the cossidential ice of five years or more, is like the blood here is like blood here is the board.
In 25 years has been from like this.
This is a problem because the interesting terrain the kind of the ground around the ocean around the ocean and where there are huge carbon of congelted which, which, they get into the microbial of the microbes.
It respect to the totality of the atmospheric warming of global warming -- that amount of doubling this point of not coming back to the way of not to get it.
In some deep foundation in Alaska is already reboiling from water.
The professoral Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was rected with a team -- based on a team -- the last last last last one.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: Law is good. The question is if we are also going to be us.
And this is that this termic exchange from the Groenlland,
This is a glacial record fighting righters.
The brought has never reached levels of the sland,
This is the Kangerlussuaq, in the soil.
If you want to know how the seal level of the sea sea ice on the ground of the ground of the sea.
These currents are increasing rapidly.
Another of the planet: Antarctics, the largest block of the planet.
The last month of scientists have degree that the ice is in negative, and that the Antarctica, and that the Antarctica, and that is a little bit about some of the submarine, is particularly rapid in the shaf of the submart.
Equival in six feet of the water, like in Groenland, like in Groenland,
On the Himalaya, the third largest block of the ice -- they see new laghi, who were glaciers.
40 percent of the world's population was going to be the several water from the monkey sed.
Sulle Ande: This glacier is the bottle.
The brought is increased.
But when you decrease it comes to the water water water water water pound.
In California neve on Sierra Nevada is about 40 percent.
The hydrodrogen are in crisis.
The previsions, as you have a little bit of it.
The growing securly is the growing door to a noevle of the incendes.
The environmental disasters are increasing a ritual of the normal and previous precedently of the normal and without previous precedental disaster of the normal disaster and without precedental disasters are increasing out of the normal disaster and without precedental pray.
Four time more numbers in the last 30 years of respect the 75.
This is a whole whole of all insustainable of all insustainable of all insustainable.
If you look at the history of the history of the history of it can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tonons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tonons in the oceans every day.
Look at the area of the Pacification of the East East Americh, and on both the parts of the subcontinent in the subcontinent of the subcontinent in the oceans.
The biggest because of the global warming of global warming -- which is 20, the use of fossil fuels.
On oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries with China.
And they proponded to build a lot of more central other
But we're seeing a direction of direction.
These are the projects of analysnulled in the last years and some of the verages of greenhouse and some of the verages.
And in every way, there is a political lottta in our country.
The carbon and oil industry has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon clean, which is a oxymore.
That image me to somewhere --
Very Natal, in Tennessee, where I lived there was a 3.8 billion liters of carbon dishes.
Maybe you saw the news of the news
This is the second largest flush of America.
It happened around Natal.
The natalization of one of the carbon industry was this one.
Video: Frosty ♫ ♫ Frosty the carbon is a kind of coal and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is more and more and more and more and more cleaner and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
It's a good price, adorable and the jobs are handing and work the jobs are the deep and the jobs are the deal.
Al Gore: From is a lot of the West Virginia.
The biggest child society on the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his friendministrator.
Video: Don Blland, he looked clearly -- I'm going to be clear -- not know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clima has launched two campaign.
This is a of bunch of bucks.
Video: ALergi: ALergist we see climate changes like a serious sery to our business.
For this one of our priority is to invest a lot of money in a switch to make public and consuming the truth to make public truth and consumption to the carbon.
In fact, carbon is not sport.
We think it's cleaned -- has a good profum.
So not prehood of climate change here.
Let me do it.
Video: Attor: The Carbon pulip -- you heard a lot of it.
So we do do a whole structure to a structure to be about how the carbon is a cleaning bely.
Straordinary. The machines are a little noisy of the carbon technology of the carbon of the technology of the carbon and the technology of the carbon and the sous.
The carbon consuming is between the main cause, but the night of global warming technology, but the night of the carbon --
Take a look at this is odiera,
Al Gore: Find, the positive alternative to the economic issues and the national safety of the national security and security of national security.
Video: Comment: Look is in crisis. The national security crisis, the climate crisis.
The file that lines all the way that we all have fossil fuels, like the carbon and oil oil oil and oil oil oil oil and oil oil oil oil and oil oil oil oil
Now, yet, there's a new solution for ushes.
Rear America: 100percent of cleaner, in 10 years.
And a pian to put the America to work, to make sure to do it safe the global warming of global warming.
Finally, a solution that you do solve our problems.
You have the American -- you have more than that.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: Comment: It's about release energy to America.
One of the fastest ways of the fast to dependence from the fuel of the fuel that kills our planet.
Comparsa: The future is here. Vently, a new network.
It's about 2: 2: Nuovi investments for nice jobs for very good jobs.
Comment: Real America. It's time of being realists.
Al Gore: A old proverbial African E-year-old says, "If you want to go fast,
If you want to go away from the together."
We need to go away fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED I did a introduction on LHC.
And I promises of switness to go back to how the machine.
So here I get it. And for those that other time there are no her, the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment, ever attempt -- 27 miles of circence.
His the job is to reach the conditions that were less than a billion of second of the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million a second.
All of that is just the unclear.
This is the machine in the Gineva.
We do these min-Big Bang in the relevel in the relevel.
This is what I work. It's called the AS -- it's like 44 feet and has a diameter of 22 feet.
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportion of the proportion of it.
The 10 sect secember we have acces: I accesidely accepted the machine for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immense in the check of the control.
It's a picture of the first fashion particles that had done all the LHC, entering enter in collision, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spreads particle inside the rewardition of the LHC, and spreads particle in the relevel of the LHC, and in
In other words, when we saw that image the 10 sect secember, we realized that the machine works, which is a great living.
I don't know if it was this to do more than that, when somebody went on Google and saw on Google and lives that the beginning, and the page was this one.
That means that we have a cultural impact beyond scientific impact of scientific fic impact of scientific fic impact on the scientific impact of what we have a cultural impact of scientific impact
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, because of these files here -- these files right here -- these dors.
These files bring 13,000 amps when the car works at the massive of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the powder of the power.
Now, the technicians in you look at the files and dirannly deep files. I'm not true. I'm films. I'm not going to be there.
And they can do it because when they're very fresh to become the superconducting surfacturing out of it.
So, at least 271 degrees, at least 271 degrees to that space between the stars, these fils can bring that current current --
In one of the junctures in the LHC, there was a difeck of factory fabrication.
So the files of surgery and 13,000 amps suddenly meant a electrical resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive if you think that these magnetic fish of 20 tons of it, and that have been moved about 30 centimeters.
They have been damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to release them, what we did --
We have repristined and addition and addition and adjusted.
Now, they're now coming back to their underpage in their place underground.
By the end of the LHC is to be new inteam.
And we accenderemy, and we expect to get the right data to jugment or himself to find out what the mornal is to find out what the mornal is the morning.
Now, of course, in a certain qual quary, these incident incident on science and engineering the value of science and engineering the engineering of the engineering of the frontier.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I want to end with the words of a scientist Inglese, Humphrey Davy, the guy, the guy, I imagined in defense of his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, he said, "No is so dangerous for the human mind of the human mind of the reporting of the human science, which is the idea of the remaintain of the human science, which are definitely not new money.
Thank you.
I want to start asking about how to think about how to be seen, as you play courage coin.
As you get them to get them to achieve them, and they can actually get them and move them, and you actually learn how to think and solve problems and make it really solving problems and manipulating relationships.
The space is deep connected to the way we understand the world around us.
So, from informatical inspired by the useful of our interaction with physical objects with my Patti, and my Jeevan Kalanithi, I started asking -- and I started asking "And if we use a computer, instead of having the only of the mouse of the mouse polymouse that is going to be on a digital polymmouse that it is to a information with entretaxive to the man,
and we have it to our pleasure pleasure to do that?
And the question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building Siftable.
And in a few words, a Siftable computer is a great interactive computer.
And in a few words, a Siftable computer is a great interactive computer.
You can move with the hand it can see the hand, they can see the right movement and they have a screen and a wireless radio and a wireless radio wireless --
But most of them are physicians as the morning, you can just move it for the morning.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem for a new ecosystem for a new ecosystem information
And as they become more physicists, you know, you know about the movement, the other people who become more physicists, and as they become more physicists, and the others, of how we move them to the new and the other fun and the fun of interaction.
He started with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show vide: if you include it it in a direction, the rotable video roads so that if you include the other sides back.
These interactive ritory is conscious of other people.
If you grab them are interested in what they're going to be done.
If they come to the circulight, they can be a little bit of it.
If they come to the circulight, they can be a little bit of it.
They also have their movements and inclination.
And then we realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the common to use of the data, as a smart as if it was a little color.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as a sea set-and I can use them to switness the color in the central of the color in the color of the color in the same time.
And I can use them to look at the color in the color of the color in the middle of the color of the color in the color of the color in the color of the color in the color of the color in the color of the color of the color in the color of the color of the color in the color of the color in the color of the colo
And if we are too too much.
There are also good possibility of learning, like languages, the mathematics and mathematics of the logical things where people can try and see the results of the very quickly and see the results of the immediately and see the results of the immediately and you can see the very quickly.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations.
Here we have a game of words that is half of Scarabeer and Boggle.
And I really, at every turnly, I got a letter to every Siftable, Pratically, every turns, and you get the letter to Siftable, and while you're looking for a dictionary to a dictionary on a dictionary to a dictionary on a dictionary to a dictionary to a dictionary to every Siftable, and as you have a little bit
And then after about 30 seconds remiss remiss and new possibility of reading and new possibility to try to try to be a new set of trying to do.
Thank you.
And this is what children came to the Media Lab, I made them so that they tried them and turned out a video.
They have a lot of pleasure a lot.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you have to give people a lot of educational people to education.
You just have to say, "Compions of words, and they know exactly what to do.
So here's how other people that try it.
This is our own better, the younger testers there on the right.
It actually wanted to be employees.
They were only morning, for him.
Now, this is an interactive appointation of a interactive cartoon
We wanted to build a tool for the lingue of the lingue of the lingue of the lingens.
It can be able to get new characters in the down, and in the Siftable their associated associated with it.
It can be able to get new characters in the down, and in the Siftable their associated associated with it.
So, it's doing the sun of the sun.
Video: The smie is surprising is surgency.
David Merrill: Now it led a treatment in the scene.
Video: The article is the article.
Bel work! Y! Y! Yeah.
So I switness and putting them close to the close can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
And I invented his own story.
Video: Hio!
DM: It's a story with the open final of opening, and it can decide him as you know.
DM: It's a story with the open final of opening, and it can decide him as you know.
Video: Gult, four.
DM: The last example I have the time to show you is a tool, made of recently of recently -- to sampling and exeguing music.
It's a tool, made of recently of recent to sampling and executing music.
The Siftable here are act on sound as basis and bacteria --
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what we use it.
You can put these sound sounds in a compounds in a compound.
And it just just making it a sound" and a "Redan." And a "Redan."
These are actually that you can control of living -- as the reveration and filter and the filter filters.
And the attack to a particular sound and then including them to the stage of the sous.
And then there are the general effects as time and flight, which is to the whole sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We will start putting a basis in two Siftable "Renza," we can go into a serious -- we add it in a seriously.
Now I put a bat the bottom.
Video: DM: DM: I add d of the percent --
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the bacteria, so I can control the effect of the live.
Video: DM: I can speak the whole whole time from a side or from one side or from the other.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the bottom to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombined the Redwish "
So I have to plan before, but I can improvid, make a longer or more corner.
And now, finally, I can sfumy the whole Redwish the Siftable to the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new interfaces more and more similar as they work as our brain and corporate as our brain.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this lost and also some possibilities that we are trying to bring out from the lab of the lab of the lab of the lab that we are trying to bring out of the lab of this lost and a few possibility that we are going to be out of the lab of this -- and I have been time to show you one of the lab of this -- and also some possibilities that we are trying to get out
The concept I want to transmit is that it's coming up with this new generation of designed to interact with digital media media to interact with digital media in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a writer.
And I think about books is my profession, but it's more than that, of course,
It's also the lovely and the falls of my life.
And I don't expect to change it.
But, I said this is that recently happened in my life and my career and my career that led me to rericalibrate with this job.
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Ama" the quality, and the quality, for a few reason he used to be a lot of the world and became a big -- and it became a big constant, sensation, extensize, interactly.
And the result is that everywhere you go from now, people who treat me as if I convicted me as if I convice.
It is true -- condanned -- condannata!
They are all concerned to me and they say, "You don't have a little bit more to do meet that we can't do better.
You don't have fear of continuing to write all of life without being able to create a book, that can be able to make a book, that can be important to somebody?"
that can care about somebody?"
It's rassure, you know.
But it could go worse and worse that I remember the more than 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a training -- I wanted to be a writer.
I would go on the same reaction of the fear.
And people say, "Don't you have successful to be successful?
You don't fear that the humiliation of the reject?
You don't fear to do this mestiate for all of life without anything that comes out and die on a heart of samp same, with the mest-shock of load s?"
So, you know, you know it.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is: "Yes, y."
And I have a fear of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also have a lot of other things that people can't be inful.
As the alggas and other things shoulder.
But, for how do it write what I thought and ask me the laughtentens to write me is why?
Is it rational?
It's logic that anyone to wait to be spend to be pushed by a job that you feel nicked to do.
But what is there is so particularly in the impreventing creative to make it nervous to be healthy in a way that other career not to do that?
As my father, for example, he was a chemistry and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activities that was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asking to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he
There was never -- that block of the engineer how do you see?
It wasn't working like this, right?
Onestly, the chemical engineers like group have not certainly in the seats, and they reputation of being alcolighed the reputation of being alcolied.
We writers, we have enough this reputation, and not only writers but creatives of all generation, we have this reputation of being enormously instable to be a huge instable to be a huge instable to be mindful for mind.
And it's not another one that look at the sad of the magnificent of the magnificent of the creative of that, only in the twentientiential secol, and often for them.
And even those who are not suicide seem to be actually made by their womens.
Norman Mailer, before we die in the last interview he said, "Look me a little more than the labor more than the work of the provide of the provide of the provide of the provide of the provide of the provide of the provide of the provide of the provide of the provide of of the provide of the providing work of the provide of the program of the provi
But we don't dancy when we hear about it because we have these things like we have these things about some things that we have completely interior and accepted the notion of creativity and sufferness are somehow to the art, and the art, and the art, and it will always be the range of the for.
And the question I want to ask all of the way is there is this ideas: are you agree?
And it goes to you this thing -- because you look at the game is not good, it doesn't look for this supposition.
I think it's odied.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great minds of living creative mind.
And certainly I know that in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to be out to be the constantly of the constantly of the circumstances where I'm in my career.
Too -- I mean, I'm pretty young and, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely that anything write I'm going to write that I'm going to be judged by the world as the work that used after my last book.
He slave to slava, because we're all more or less friends here -- is likely to my greatest successful -- is the most successful to my shoulder.
Oh, Gesood, which is thinking.
You know this is the kind of thought that brings that brings a person starting to be, and I don't want to do it.
I would keep doing this work that we do.
So, the question becomes god, right?
And so I would seeds me -- after many reflection that the way to keep writing is to write that to create a perty perted, right?
I have to find a few way to find a security of security between me, which I'm writing about the reaction of which is reacting for all the last year, and I was trying to look for all the time to look for the time, trying to find other society to see if they could have the best ideas and more healthy and more healthy of healthier and more healthiest blood and more healthy of healthy and more healthiest and more healthy and I have the blood
how to help people create the emotional inerent risks of creative inerents of creative creativity.
And that research took me to the Greek and ancient Roome.
And I saw it because it gives the circle and then back.
In the ancient Greek and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity seven, OK?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit looks like the constent and that came from a few miles, and unknown, for reasons and unknown -- for reasons and unknown away.
The green were called these convents of the creativity of creativity "demonight."
Socrat, wonderful, he believed to have a demon the helight-sagged from the mother's smother.
The Romans, they were the same idea, but they called that kind of spirit without a genius of the spirit of the same idea,
The one that is great, because the Romans didn't think that a genius was a particularly smart of them is smart.
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine entity that creates were literally in the study of a artist, a little like the Dobby, and who came to assister of the artical job of the artical job and the artical work of that work.
Ecceptional -- there is the distance of the part, that cost psychological costructure, which is the results of your work.
And everyone knew that was so that it worked, right?
So the antic artists were protts of certain things, like the too narcisism, right?
If your job was an exceptions, you couldn't get the mergely to the mer, all knew that he helped out of this incorporeo.
If your fail, it wasn't all all of the whole bunch of your fail, right?
They all knew that was your genius to be a inable to be a unable to be a unable to be a unable to be a unable to be a unable to be a inable.
And so the people han concept of the creativity in Ocker for a long time.
And then the Rassure, and it changed this great ide; we put the human being to be the center of the universe on the center of the universe and the mysteries that write creatures that write the devation of the devation of the devation of the devation.
This was the principle of the rational principle and people began to think that creativity became completely from the ishshelf of the ish.
And for the first time in history, I started to reference this or that article like a genius rather than a person with a genius rather than a person with a genius of the genius to be like a genius or a kind of genius to this or a person of genius to be in the same time.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big mistake there.
I think that allow somebody to believe that it is like a recipe of creating as a recipe as the source and the surprising and the surprising mysteries is a responsibility for a very big devation to give up a very big deal for fragile to fragile that human.
It's like to ask somebody to save the sun of the sun --
It deform and distores completely the ego and creates all these ingestiable expectations on performance.
And I think it was this pressure that we have destroy the artists in the past of the past of the past of the past of the past of the past of the past of the past of the past of the past of the past.
And, if this is true, and I think that it is, and I think the god?
Can we do it different?
Maybe go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery mystery of creative relationships.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't cell 500 years of thinking about rational thinking.
And you probably have people in the audience that would be suspect of scientific suspects on the notion of the notion of the notion of the notion of the notion of their projects.
And you probably don't even convinced you all about this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why now?
Why don't think about this way?
Because it has more sense of everything that I've ever heard to explaining the explans of creative process.
And one process that anybody ever tried to do something -- so fundamentally, all here -- yeah, not rationally becoming -- you don't have rationally rational.
And, in fact, it can sometimes be completely paranormal.
I did this recently meeting with the Ruth poetcle Ruth Stone, who has now 90 years, but that was a little bit of life and he said in his childhood in the Virginia, worked out in the Virginia, and he was going to be the landscaped from the landscape to be from the landscaped from the landscape.
He said that it was like a fragorous train of the air.
And that was coming to rolling back to her from the landscape.
He felt it got to get it to get the earth under his feet.
He knew that point and it was to do that point and it was like, "curring as a morn."
And it was going to go back to the house and came up with this poetry and she wouldn't have to make a piece of paper and a pretty fresh enough -- and a fresh pretty quickly -- and the trail, and it on the page.
Sometimes it couldn't be fast and it was so quickly and reports and reaching without able to get to the house and the rolew the roolating the roolating through and she was going to roll through the landscape, and she was going to be in the paper, and she was going to be a little bit of it, and she said, "other hon."
And then there were those times -- this is not going to forget -- there were moments where the was almost lost of the time was almost lost -- right?
So, she was running at home and he was looking for the card and he was going through it, and he was a mart right in the while she was passing, and then he said she was like to walk with the other hand and the step and the step and the step and the step and the off.
And he was the poem of the code and the turned into his body and turned into his body and turned into the page.
And in these cases, the poey would be presented on the perfect page, and it would be in the last word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first one of the word at the first time.
So when you hear it -- it's crazy -- it's just the eat, it's exactly the way to my creative process
Not all my creative process -- they're not a conducting.
I'm a mult, and my way of work is -- I sweat the same time and go to the same orary every day and go over the enjoy and go over the enjoy of the life of it.
But even yet me in my head, I skied on the way, I grew up against that thing, to you.
And I imagine many of you have been fact.
You know, even if the work and the ideas came up with the ideas came from a certain source of not that I could not be say.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to it in a way to not lose us to the head, but pluttsted, what does that do is it stay same?
And as I think about it, the best contemporary example I have is the musicianeum of Tom Waits, which I interviewed a few years ago for a journal.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the major life of the article of the artical artically, the toment, trying to control it, to make these kind of creatives of the creatives of the creatives of the creatic impulses of creativity.
But then you get up, and she was going to be saving on a day and she was driving on a Los Angeles, changed all for him.
He was going fast, and all of a seal tradition of this little bble framework that comes into his head, which comes into his head, and the wish and the wish and the wish and the wish -- and the wish -- but it doesn't know how to take it.
It has no maker piece of paper has not a mark of it.
So it starts to feel this kind of old anxious growing in him up, "I'm going to lose and remarring from this very very high session.
I don't have enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to go to the panic stop.
And he did the whole process of mental and made something completely new thing.
And he just watched the sky and said, "Cus," I don't see that I'm driving?"
"Do you look like it can write a song now?
If you really want to exist, you get to a more opport, when I can take care of you.
Of course, you go to to get somebody else today,
You go to the Leonard Cohen."
And his work process changed after that.
Not the work was even even dark as it was even even though it was a little bit like it.
But the process, and the fish that attornic was released when the genius prevented when the genius came out of the genius that was going to be the back back back where it came from, where it came from, which was going to be a whole thing about the interior and torgned.
But it has this peculiar co, wonderful bizard, and this external thing between Tom and this external thing that was not Tom.
So how much the feeling that story started to change a little bit as I worked and already saved me a time.
This idea, I was saved when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, and fall," and faller in one of those disperation where we all all over when we are working on something and we can't start thinking that it is going to think that it will be a worse book, which is the worst book that the worst was written written to write that would write it to me that will be the worst book, which is the worst books that is going to be write that will
Not just good at the worst book written to writ.
And I started thinking about throwing this project.
But then I remember Tom I talk about the air and tried us
So I went to my face on the hand on my hands and I would say, to a corner of the room.
And I said to you, "You know, I said, "You know, you know that books will not be brilliant not going to be brilliant, right?
Because as I see that I'm putting all of what ho, I haven't have more than that.
So if you want to be better and do your side.
Okay. But if you don't do it, you know, I don't know whatever.
I'm going to write the same because it's my job.
And I would like to do my talk, which was today to do my part, because I -- at the end is -- at the end of the North Africa -- at the end of the North Africa people were danced for the dance, and dance, and the dance, and music and music and music that they went on for hours and the headed to the headed and the walk to the hea.
And they were always magnificent because the dances were fantastic professionals, and they were fantastic.
But every tant, I rarely something happened, and one of these artists became actually translate reality --
And I know what I talk about what I talk about, because I know you have all of it, a lost point, a lost of them --
It was like the time is stopped as if you stops through a kind of lapse and was not doing anything different from the sun, as the 1,000 notes, but all of the 1,000 notes, but all it stinked it.
And suddenly not only appeared to be a human being.
But you access to divince and under the devation of divinity.
And when this next to the time -- the time they knew what was, they were called his name.
They were the hands and started to cant, "Allah, Allah, God Did, God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know.
Curious note -- when the Morderer the Spain the Spain of the Spain of the Spain with their and the ready to be in the centuries of "Allah, heah, Allah, heah, you still hear in the corrids or in flamen.
In Spain, when a artist has done something impossible and magic -- "Allah, magnified, you know, you can -- a little bit of God.
And it's great, because we have to do it.
But, the problem comes up the next day for the ballerine itself, when you sweh and discoveries that are the 11 of the Martedday and the God of God is there more.
It's just a mortal with great male to the knee, and maybe not going to be able to be able to be able to be to the sell to that alteach to that altea.
And maybe nobody will give the name of God still as it goes, and what has it to do with the rest of his life?
It's difficult to it.
This is one of the most pain of the sweeping of a creative life here.
But maybe it has to be so angoscious if you can not believe, you can not believe, well, of the most extraordinary of your being come from you to your.
But it creates you just have data in the prester of this team of this team of this team of your life that you have to go to somewhere you have fine.
And, you know, if we think of this is change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought for several months during the work of the book that publics, I'm going to be the foreign the most of my great.
And what I have I have to keep saying that I was elected by this is, I don't have craft.
Not just falls. It just just your job.
It is going to presenting you for your side, whatever it can be.
If your work is dance, you know, you get it to ball.
If the divin, I assurging and I would have to leave some kind of wonder, for a few wonderful time through your effort and just a moment through your efs, then "Yea!"
Something you have the same thing.
And "O!" at yourself, you know,
I think I think I think it has to teach it.
Oh, you know, even if you have a human and testing and tests on the facturning of them to make you continuously present.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: O!
As you know I've already talked about some of these projects on the genome of the genome of the genome of the genes.
Now we're starting a new percornner, we started to digitalize biology and now starts from that digital code we are entering into a new fase of the biology, designing and switness.
We always tried to be several questions.
"What is the life?" is something that many biologists I think we have to understand a var levels.
We tried a different approach, reducing the minimum of terms of terms of the terms of the terms of the process.
We're digitalizing from almost 20 years ormays.
When we sequenced the human genome was treating of the world of biological biological biology to the digital world of the computer.
Now we ask our: can we regenerate life, or create a new life from this digital universe from this digital universe from this digital universe from this digital universe to digital life from this digital universe from this digital universe to digital life from this digital universe from this digital universe from this digital universe to the digital universe from this digital universe
This is the map of a little organism -- the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from genome that can autorous in the lab of the ones that can autorous.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one more more smaller than one more smaller.
We can get a hundred genes of the genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we take a chicken to his metabolic map is relatively simply to the nostr.
It creates me this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate -- it's very unlikely to be able to get a living cellula to the living cell.
So we decided that the only way to progression was synthesize this to be able to make this chromosome.
And so we started the beventure of "Can we can synthesize a chromoso?"
Can you know chemistry to produce these great molecules that we haven't ever been able to create before we have to create before that?
And in case that we can make a chromoso?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material of iners.
The speed that we are able to digitalize life is growing up to exponential rely exponential of the life is growing up to exponential rely growing up to the life is growing up to relaims of the speed that we are exponential.
Our ability to write the genetic code -- again progressive code and rather improving it.
And our most recently results the results of exponential curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of step, starting with a biothic revision before we started the first experiments.
But we found that DNA is very difficult to synthesize DNA is very difficult to it.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that product little segmental segments, the most of the segment of the segment of the segment is longer to be -- more mistake we are.
So we had to develop a new method, to be the mistake and relaims to relaims and relaims of the mistake of the mistake of the mistake and reefs the mistake of these fragments and relaims and reefs the mistake of these framatics.
And this was our first attempt to start from Phi of Phi Phi Phi 174.
It's a little virus that kills bacteria.
We designed the fragments, effective of the mistake of the DNA of about 5,000 letters.
The interesting part of is when we took this piece of chemical material and we put it into bacteria and we put it into the bacteria and started reading this genetic code and the production particles.
The virals have been released by the cells, they came back and they came back and they have destroy the Es.
I talked about recent with the petrolifes of the petrolifes say that they have certainly understood this model.
They reported more of you.
We think this is a situation where the software can really build his own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the biggest things --
We wanted to build the whole chromosome.
They're more than 580 mile lymer code.
So we thought we could build it in the bottom-up of virus, so that we can change the seven-up to understand what the components of a living cellula cell.
The design is crucial and if we start with digital information into a computer, these must be very accurate information.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995, the standard accuratness was of a 10 mile mile for every 10 mile mile of the Sunce.
We have discovered -- we have discovered 30 mistake errors. If we had that original sequence we never had to be able to do it work.
One part of the process is designing for a long time to be segment with all other segment of 50 letters to build underunit to build smaller underunits.
We try to give one of the job elements here.
You probably have to be the side that we put on the flights of the flights.
And think this is that we have a genetic code on four letters: A, C, G, and T.
Three of those letters together to codifice about 20 amminoid and there's a specific order of reading for every local amminoid of the lamminoid of the lamminoid of those laws of adminioid of these letters of beef bats and of the letter of bags to every lost lo
So we can use the genetic code to write words, you know, phrase.
What we have done at the beginning was autography.
Some of them have been dolphushed by the fact that it was not a poet-to-aside.
We designed these sat these sat them just to make them just uniququencies.
There are enzymes and they put them and they put them on it.
And we started to get the parts, starting, starting with five to seven milletter from five to seven milletter to seven milletter to the sat 72 milletter to the letter to 72 milletter to 72 milletter to the letter.
And every step we made these segments in the abundance so that we are trying to make a very robat -- as you will see in a very robate proceeding -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems to be the tabellon a baskets.
When we get these very long-mile segments, more than 100 miles, they don't grow more directly directly to the E.
You get to the modern of the modern tools of molecular biology.
So we looked at other mechannels.
We knew about another mechanism called a homology mechanism called the recombination of the DNA to repair the DNA to repair the DNA to be able to be able to be able to be the segments.
Here's an example.
This organisms, called Deinococcus radioharvest radioiss, it can absorb three million radiation.
You can see in the ground, as his chromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours comes assembled exactly how it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that have to do it.
These organisms can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be touch complete complete complete complete it.
They can live under a vacuum of it.
I'm absolutely sure life exists in space, and you smooth to find new rich environments of water rich of water.
And in fact, the NASA showed that this avail.
This is a picture of the molecule, we just built using these processes -- just using the lievidence with the design of the sat the inserious design of inserious segments to inseriously.
The lit lights them assembat.
This picture was not taken with a electron microscope, but with a microscope.
It's a molecule, which we can see a microscope.
These are picture that they cover a time of about six seconds.
This is the publication that we did a little time ago.
They're more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the largest molecules of a definitely definitely that we've been created by man.
It has a lot of a lot of 300 million of them --
If we spent it with a 10 paper without spaces, they would like 142 pages only to turn this genetic code.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we activate it?
Of course, you get a virus is a virus is a young girls.
It's a little more complicated when they use bacteria.
It's the simpler when it's about the eucariote cells, as we can just extract the nuclee and you can just get the nuclee and inserird, which is basically the process of cloning.
In the bacterium is instead of integrated into the cell of the cell -- but we have recently showed that we are able to do a birthday of a cell of a cell chromosome,
We can refied a partner chromosome.
The two are different as men from the topis.
We added some gene more in a way that we could decide what to do for this chromosoon.
And then the hold with the enzymes in a way to kill all proteins.
And when we put it into the cell was stupid -- and we open our graphic degraph -- the new satic -- the new chromosome.
And we were starting that we couldn't go that we could go down and we have more in the spinger of it.
This is one of the greatest mechanisms of evolution.
We found that many species have added a second or a third of a third of some parts, I added a few parts, I added in a second thousands of new trats to that species.
So who think about evolution as a only gene to evolution as a gene of the biology.
There are enzymes called the restrictions, is that even that we have digest DNA.
The chromosomes that was in the cell of it has not a one.
The cell phone-the chromosomes we inseritos.
And it turns out that other extreme the other chromosome, as a material, as a mosome. And we got sticate, and we have been with only the cellula and the new cromost.
It became blue because of the genes that we have inserved.
And in a short lasses of time, all the characteristic characteristic of a species have gone in a new software that we put in the new software that we put in in the cell.
All the proteins has changed, membranes have changed, and when we read the genetic code the balance code exactly what we have we transfed.
Now, this could look at genetic alchemy of DNA -- but by the DNA software we can change things in a pretty replace.
Now, I already explained that this is not talking about genesis -- but of progress from three million evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion of this digital process.
Why do it that?
I think it's pretty obvious when we think of our needs.
We're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just for a example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946; 40 years, there will be four years, there will be four to be four years, there are going to be four to be four to be four to the planet to be four to be four people on the planet to each other people on the planet to each other people on the planet for each other people on the planet for each other people to be four.
We're going to have now now now to find the fresh and cleaning and drug for six and a half billion people.
It will be even harder to do it for nine billion.
We use more than five billion carbon dion, more than 30 billion barrels of the olight.
That means a million barrels of the day.
When we try to find biological processes or whatever the process of rewar, and it will be a huge challenge challenge to be a huge challenge of it.
And more we need to keep the whole of all the CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere.
On today, thank you to the scientific discoveries around the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that they're designed for the future.
The electronic industry is only a dozen of the component -- and think about how many different things are coming out of it.
Our limits here are the principly, and our imagination.
Now we have the techniques of these rapidness methods of these rapidness methods of creating what we call combinative genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic metos.
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day.
Think of process, these 20 million different genes or to try to optimize the processes to produce either either or a framework or new vaccines, and create more biology and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard selection selection.
We can choose for surviving, chemistry or carbon vaccines to be baccines.
This is an instantanea of software programmed that we're working for being working for being able to sit and designing species to the computers.
Well, we don't know that we need it as they do.
We know exactly what their genetic code.
Now we're focused on the carbon of fourth generation.
You also see that you get to extract ethanol was an experiment was a multimately experiment.
We have more carbon on on on on the third generation that will be praise as the either of the highest or as the either of the either of the either of them --
But the only way that biology can have a great impact of the cost of food and limiting the cost of food and limiting the divil of food and the divil of the CO2 in materials that we are working for design cells that can achieve this purpose -- and we are able to be able to be this purpose-generation in about 18 months.
The sunlight combined with the CO2 is a methodoctor, but in our discoveries around the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean deep ocean to about 2,500 feet of the water.
It creates metane from the CO2 molecular hydrogen molecular hydrogen of energy.
We're trying to figure out if we can get the CO2, which can easily be transported by the CO2 in carbon in carbon in carbon in carbon in carbon in carbon in carbon in carbon in the process.
So short we think we could be able to increase what the question of the basis of what the question is, "What is the Noen, true -- we have the goal of remultiple of rewards the petrochemistry of petrochemical industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do that?
It would be a main of energy.
And so as we are working for using the same methods to create the instantaneous vaccines to create the instantanes.
You saw this year with influence, we're always behind a year and a dollar in less when it's about the gain, and a dollar vaccine to the right vaccine fair.
I think that what you can change by combinable vaccines in anticians.
And this is how the future could start to look change, now, the tree of evolution, accelling the evolution with synthetic bacteria -- and finally hell and the euch cells.
We're so so much as we get people to improve people.
Our purpose is to do a lot of living enough to try to try to make it for a lot of it. Thank you very much.
And the first of all I would show you the fastest as possible, some fundamental job, the new technology that we have brought to the Microsoft in a year ago -- this is Seadragon.
It's a very environmental level that you can interact with a huge amount of data with a huge amount of data with a huge amount of data here.
Here are seeing a lot of the gigabyte of digital zoom with a kind of zoom costing and continuous panoramic and continuous panoramic speed, and degree the images as we want to see the images as we want to see the images as we want to see the images as we want to see the images of a kind of bread, and I continued the panoramic zoom as we want.
And it doesn't matter how much much the amount of information that we see -- how much are these things or the images.
Most are common photographs, but this for example, is a provenue from the Bible of Congress, and reenter in the legal legal of Congress, and reenter in the legal legal of the Congress,
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any moment. It's also a very flexible architecture in whatever.
This is a whole book, example of data not imagines.
This is the Dickens. Every coonna represents a capitulum represents a capitulum of the Dickens.
And to show you that it's just about the heads and not imagines, we can do something like that, to show you really that it's a real representation of the head, not of a picture.
It could be a little artificial books to read a electronic book.
You don't advision it.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian.
Every image is the beginning of a selection.
And it really gives you the pleasure of reading the experience of reading the real version of a magazine or a fifth of a fifth or a quotidid, which is for nature of a lot of a half of it.
We also did something with the angle of this number in the particular of the Guardian.
We created a fasulla advertise to resolve -- much more than what you use in a normal commercial publishing -- and we inserted the content of extraordinary content -- and we initiate content --
If you want to see the characteristic characteristic of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific models, or even the specific way.
And this really shows some of these ideas to heliliminate the limits of space on the screen.
And we hope this gentlemployed to put the pop-up and other doors -- not to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And on this not to lose time, if I don't mean that we have contributed to give them in this field.
These are all the streets in the United States is on a geossial image of the NASA.
So now we go to something else.
This is now from the living living on the webs; you can go to see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which fights two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research to the Noah Snavely, a student of the University of Washington, with the aid of the UWashington, with the aid of Microsoft Rick Szelii of Microsoft Research of Microsoft Research Research Szelilian Emn Research of the Microsoft Szeliplies of the University
And it's from the living on the web, the Seadragon.
You can see that when we do this kind of screen and you can see that as a picture of the other and have this kind of experience to be resolution in the multiple experience of the multiple experience of it.
But the space collapse collapsed here has actually a meaning.
The visualization of the computer have recorded these images together, so that they correspond to the real places, so that they correspond to the real places.
I don't know if I have time to show you another environment.
There are a lot more space than that.
I want to spend a directly to one of the original data of Noahs -- and this is from a previous protope of Photosnths that we have done for the first time -- to show you what I think is really the key thing is the key to show you what I think is the key to show you what the environments is the surprising of the environments that we have in the website we have in the web.
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of Notre-construction of Notret Flickr. Bater's Dame in Flickr Basta Flickr and you get images of the camp and the camp and the camp and the camp and the camp and the camp and I say, and you can get the around.
So they're all related to Flickr and have been all related to this way.
And you can have this simple way of this simple.
You know, I wouldn't have thought of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very free to get this kind of acvast of acvation.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of framework of those of the SLR, a a number meaning of the SLR, a number meaning of these environment.
And if you can go to look at those more strange.
Many are blocked by faces, etc.
Something is a series of photographs -- there is a serious of photographs -- there is excold.
This is a poster of Notreally, First Little First Latch is a poster of Notred.
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now taking data from all the collective data from the whole collective of how to apt the Earth, from the view of visual data from the side, from the visual point of view.
All those pictures become connected together, more than the sum of the parts.
You have a model of the entire emerged model of the entire emerges.
Think about this as a promoting work of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual Earth virtual --
It's something that growing in complexity as people use it, and the advantages for who are using, and the ances of the use.
Their pictures are marked with other people.
If somebody comes the idea of contrast all of these things say -- my picture of the Notre's cattle of Nots Dame suddenly immersed of all those dates, and I can use how the point of the data sends of all those data, and I can use the picture of that space, and I can use the picture of the type of a red red-to-shelf and cross-to-use of the type of type type of type of these data,
Of course, a consequence of all this is extremely elaborated by all the interesting of the earth -- the ground of the earth-range and images and satellitary images and satellitary memory and satellitary memory and satellitary memory and the collective memory of the earth of the earthest and the satellite of all the time.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized good? What is going to be doing is that to do is that at a point, in the next few years, all the photographs -- all the other photographs -- and they are going to be basically connected together?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing basically it is discovering.
It's creating hyperlink, if you want to be wants, between imagines.
And it's doing it in the content of the imagines.
The thing becomes very interesting thing if you think about the seeds of the seed:
As when you do a research of images on the web, you have a frub and the text on the page page of the picture.
Now, what happens if that picture is going to be all your picture?
So the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of rich interconnecting is really enormous for the remade. It's a classical effect of the net.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible. Compliments.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the main pleasure of when you travel and one of the delight-research is the to live between who has not forgotten the antic of the traditional and the traditional and the traditional in the wind, the gate of the pleture of the plant plat, the gate of the plants.
You know, the thought that the monkeys Jaguar travel even beyond the Mily Lattea, or that the Inuit or that in Himalaya, the budge of the Dhar, or that in Himalaya, the budger of the Dhar, to remember the world of the antic anti-foot of the ancient of the world of anthropologic antic antic of reality, but it's just a model of reality, but it's just a model of reality,
The consequence of a particular set of adaptive choices that our stirs has done, or multimately -- a lot of generations ago.
And, of course, we all share the essential track.
We all have to have all procreate.
We're subjects to start with the initiation.
We have to deal with the inesorability of death and whales --
We all have a art of it.
What it hits is the particularly rhythm of the dances of every culture.
Not matter that are the forest of the Borneo, or the following of the Borneo, or the Haiti, or the desert of the Kaith's Wenya Sepentrison, or a Sepriorry, or a camelf in the heart of the Sahara.
He was my journey of my journey in desert a month ago, or a yak of the Hewalls of the Qomolan's Mountain of the world.
All of these people teach us that there are other ways of thinking about existing other ways of thinking about it, other ways of moving in the world.
And, if you think of a moment, it's a concept that it can give you hope.
Inside, the cultures of the world creating a spiritual of the world creating a spiritual and cultural life that it is important for the benefit of the planet as as the rail.
And you can think about this cultural ragnant as a late of ethnosphery and you can call the ethnosphery of all the concepts, wide, inspirations, intuitions that are being from the imagination of the consciousness of the consciousness of the conscious ruption of the consciousness of the conscious rence.
The ethnospher's amazing potential of humanity.
It's the symbol of what we're and what we can be as as as as as as as inquise.
And because biosphere has been severely consumed as it as a lot, and unfortunately very quickly.
No biologist for example, would say that 50 percent of all the species has been or on the earth of the summer, because it is fail, or the hold -- in the field of the biological ize, and you don't have to near the same as a near ipox, as a little bit of the cultural ipoxy -- that of the cultural ipox.
The indicates of all of this is, of course, the language of language.
When you're born there were 6,000 lings, on this planet.
A language is not only from a vocabulary or of a series of gramatical rules.
One language is the price of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit spirit spi
It's the half of which animates of every culture of every culture in the material.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a spiritual ecosystem thinking, a spiritual ecosystem.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we are sitting in Monterey, at least half of the hang is not more ssurrying in the ears of the children.
They don't get more teachers to the kids, the means that less not camel something, which is already dead.
What do you have more tristable to be the silence of being the last talk to a language of talking about a language of the sad of the sad of the sad or of the ancestors or of the children?
This is orring is the state of somebody in the world every two weeks a few weeks a week and a little bit die and the silly of a language of a language of a language of a language of a language of a language of an another.
And I know that somebody will say "Is it not better better like this?
The world would not be a better place if we were all yor?" Benisyorness, then we talk all yoruba. Let's talk about all yoruba.
Let's talk about a kid of it.
You will show you a track, which means not to talk to not talk to the language.
I would like to do a journey through the ethnosspathnosspaper --
a little journey in the ethnosphery of what we're perdening.
Many of us of us say "different ways of existing existing is really different ways of existing existing in different ways of existing
And we take for example, this Barasana, in Sepentrion Seprion Sepritheral of anacony, which creates the military of the Latin the South the South the Scil of the Last of the Last of the sacris.
It's a population that is not able to distinguish the blue color, because the celests is identified in the forest because the forest, celest, which is identified in the forest of the forest --
They have a strange language and a marriage of marriage -- ""Hoogamicist," you have to married a different language.
All of that has roots in the miteological past, is that in these families are talking about six or seven lings, which is that there is no one of the mystical matrimonsters in the mystic making.
They just just listen to and then they start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with the most interesting tribes that I lived -- the Waorananans, an incredible population that has had the first contats in 1958.
In 1957 five mission of them attempt to committed a factremendous mistake a fact.
They made them out of the high-dimensional photographs that they were depended in a few that they were lovely demented that this popular forest, had never seen anything about bi-dimensional bi-dimensional bi-dimensional bi-dimensional bi-dimensional bi-dimensional bi-dimensional bi-dimensional bi-dimensional pluvial that they were demented with the force of the rain the street of the for.
They collected the photos from the ground of a form or a shape or a figar and not find nowil, they have to be the deavailed of the diavol, and they killed the five mission with the lances.
But the Waorans didn't just killed the stranimal stranies.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope I call other than you have heard and proverse some links in case not not born them them.
I want to start with what I call "the official dogma offic."
The dogma official of what?
The dogma official companies of all the Western industry and the official companies -- "If we want to mass to be the benefit to be the benefit is to be massizzed, "The way to do it as a weak of the individual."
The reason it is a side, from a size, in fact, that freedom is in the same value, is a valuable for humans.
The other one is the fact that if we are free, each of us can act for all of what mass similar to do everything that mass the well-being, no one who decided to be in the name of our.
The way to massizing the freedom is to be massized.
More people people are freedozen are free, and more is their freedom, more or is their freedom, more hand is their beneath to be freedoing.
This is a deep deeply rooted in society that nobody would be able to put it in a two.
And it's also deeply deeply in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has recommen.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly great.
I lost a simple note on the condition for insane for initive.
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions, without contact the 10 variety of extracts of olive olive and 12 balloon the samic acets, you can buy a huge number of constance of the increasing of the 175 ready is of your gradiment.
Here's what the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic stere: CD, radio, cassletter -- cassles, radio, radio, plast, the amplific.
And in this single electric same, there is a great audience.
We can do six million combinations using the components that there are in a negotial of that there are in a negoti.
You need to admit that there is a lot of choices.
Some camp: the world of communications.
And once I was a kid, they could get all the services, the pat the phone of the phone that were the mom of the Bell.
He was born the phone is not buying it.
And one consequence of that, in the way, was that the telephone is that the telephone is not a make.
These times, they went to go.
We have a lot of a variety of telephone of the phone cellular cellular cellular cellular cellular --
Here are the cells of the future.
My favorite is that in the middle, MP3, cut of the nose of the nose and the nose of the nose crash.
If you don't have seen it still has seen in the store under the case, you're going to get there.
And what happens is that the people are going to be entering in the game and it makes this question. And you know what the answer is, "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water, you can be the same explosion of choices.
Law About of healthy -- not happening in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor of the doctor and what you have to do.
Instead, you go from the doctor, and the doctor says, "OK, we could do A, or B" "A has these benefits and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks of the risk and these risks of the risk and these risk of these risks and these ris
You say, "Doctor, what would I have to do that?"
And the doctor says, "In has these benefits and these risks, and BButs have these risks and these risk."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you rebat, "Doctore if she was me, what do you do?"
And the doct, "But I'm not leight."
The result of the result of malato," expression that makes it seem a beautiful thing.
But actually, it's not a smop and the responsibility of the decisions of making decisions from somebody who knows something, which is the doctor, to somebody else who knows -- and almost certainly is maled -- and so not in the ideal condition to make the egging patient.
There is a huge marketing of drugs, direct to people like me and you, that if you think of it doesn't make any sensible, which we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy them, why do they do it because they do it?
The answer is that they want to do that domultimately call the doctor to ask the rich of changing the reciph of the rich of changing the rich of changing the reciph of changing the reciph of changing the reciph of the rich of changing the reciph of the reciph of the reject.
And what is so fundamental as is our identity is a question of choice, as you see in this vignant -- "We don't want to force the children. We don't want to force the children. We don't want to be more an identity: we need to invent a longer identity: we need to invent to invent.
And we can reinventing how many times we get aggrade.
The means that every morning, you have to decide to risk you have to decide to be.
And in the family and marriage of the marriage of time perspective perspective, it almost anybody was that he was the most prestant, and it was that I could get the most prestable as well.
The only real choice was with chemical chemistry, not when I would.
Over day, everything is really to play it.
I mean, I think of smart very smart, and I do their 20 percent of work than a time.
And not because they're less diligent because they're less diligents.
But why are they implemented to ask is, "should I marries or no? I should be able or no? I should I do that now?"
"Would I have to think before I think before the children or care?"
They're interrogatives of horribly now.
And they try to answer these questions, even though this imply doesn't completing the companies that you could have a good vote to my exame.
And they must really do that. I'm going to do that.
Now, the job: we're lucky, like Carl subolineava, because the technology allows us to work every day, every day, from every day, from every day, except from the Hotel Randph.
And in parents, there's a corner, and I'm not going to tell nobody where the WiFi works.
I don't say that, because I want to use it.
What is that meaning that we have about the work that we have about the job? Is it we have to keep on on the job, if we need to work or not.
We can go to see our boy play with the cell phone in a poccket in the other, and the night in the wild and the night of the knee.
And even though they're all she'd see that we see our board's game and we also ask the game is that we are asking this call?"
"I have to answer this email? I have to email?"
And even when the answer is "no," this makes the experience of your headlines of your children's game from what would be in other conditions.
So, anywhere we look at all look at the little bit and big, things and the life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: Ovo, there were some possibility of choices, but it was a question of choice.
The world today, the world is this is, "Is it a positive thing or saying, "Is it a positive thing or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative.
The answer is the Sunce.
The positive lightening to talk about the negative ones of the negative of the negative of the negative of the negative lays.
All this is that two negative effects of the two-negative effects on people.
The first one, paradoximately is that producing paralysix,
With many options between the choice, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I offered a meaning for example, a conducted study of volunteer pensionating.
A connected connects to the data of Vanguard, the gigantesse societies with about a million depension of a million clients in 2,000 companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are more money to be offered more and the percentage of adedescscenes on 2.
With 50 founds, there is 10 percent of less adedesionate adedesions are only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources of the boards, it's detail, it's detail, and choice comes to the inman.
And I still ask question, and I won't ask question, and of course, the questions, and of course, the won't get there.
You know that not just means that these old workers from old foot food, because they won't have enough money to say that decision is so obstant that decision is so obstant that even the fundamental fundamentary of the dator of the dator of the workers of the data.
Not participate, they're lost to 5,000 dollars for the data, which would be a lot of work, which would be a good displace.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too much choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally, for the ethchecketchup, senape or maines?"
You would like to take the right decision -- if it's for ethothness, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong source, and you don't want to choose the wrong condition to the wrong condition of the wrong.
So this is the first effect is that even though we can avoid paralysis and make a choice, and we end up and do a choice, and we are less unless of options of how we were to prevent the outside of what you would choose to the board.
And this for different reasons.
One of those is that with many conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional and it's not perfect to imagine that you could have been able to imagine that you could have been better to imagine that you could have been better for the imagined by the choice, and the remitting rewards of choice, and the rempiant ssatisfy of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision that is going to be better than the decision of the decision of the defam.
even when it was a good decision.
More choices us are easy to any detail of any detail of any details that is inherent of choice.
And so, there is what economists call cost-cost-cost economics.
DGilbert has very well stamatten as the value that we give to the things to depends on what we say is about what we do to conversation.
Del rest, when there are many options as we can represent the features of the alternative cars of the alternative and being less sodable of the option of the option that you have choice.
Here's an example. I have to get me with all those who are not in New York.
But it's what you probably think about it.
There's this copy of Hamptons.
A place of the lusside.
It splendid. Oty day -- it's all for them.
It doesn't lack anything. But what he thinks it is: "Well, maledian, it's Agoor."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan is alive.
"I could talk about right at the cast of the front of it."
And it spends two weeks that is perating -- every day -- the possibility of parking -- every day -- the possibility of parking where you want.
The decrease cost-up costs the satisftion for what we have, when the choice was excellent --
And the more are the options that we have to look at the more active characteristic characteristic characters are going to come up against opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
It tells us about the right now, and maybe live slowly.
But the most important point is that you chosen to do not do others.
The things that we don't choose to attactive attractive attractive of what we do.
Third point: the spiral growing of waiting.
I tried to buy a new jeans.
And almost always jeans.
Once jeans were just a few of a wheelms, they were swing out of the best, just after they were smoking them a life and work a lot of times, starting to go good.
So, I went to buy a couple of jewels, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cut."
The committed told me "Looks wants slim fit, relaxed it does?"
You want to look at the cernic or with the bott? "Stonehed" or "acid." or "acid."
"Do you want to have it to be the rot?"
"eight them want to be a stret? Black hang -- they would Continuy to elencar.
I was sance, and after a little bit of I could say, "I want the kind of -- that was the only one tis" -- that was the only one tis" -- and I tried to all the malear jeans, then I came out of the negoti, with the best Snegogoti, with the best for the negoti, with the best of jeans that I had ever had it.
It was the mous. With all that choice was the best I had the better.
But I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a book, I understand it.
The reason I was worse is that I was worse is that I was the kind of a lot of my expectations were altis;
And I was waitimated. I wouldn't expect to be expected when there was only one of the guy was just a little bit of a different guys -- at least one guess was a perfect of it.
What I had watched was good, but not perfect it.
After I had paragoned to what I was trying to be insodable in confronted to expect the waite.
The addition of the people don't make the expectations of the people don't make the expectations of the options of the options of the options itself.
And this will be less soddisfation, even when the results are good for it.
None in the world of marketing if it makes it matters it.
Because if you know what I'm talking about.
The truth looks like this.
"You were better when it was worse when the worst was better when it was worse when it was worse to the worst was that when it was worse to the premise of evolved.
Over the world that we live -- the world -- the industrialized citizens with the expectancy of perspective -- the maximum that we can hope is that things are at the height of waiting for waiting.
You never have to surprised because of your expectations because your expectations and my expectations are ingiant and I have ingiant it.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is "Basit" "Yeah, I want."
I mean -- I want to say -- I'm really married and my wife is really stupid and my wife is really stupend.
I wouldn't have to do better, I didn't have to do better.
But it is not always a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of the buying a couple of jeans is that when you have only that jeans is that when you're not satisfacfacfacting, and you ask you "Why do that?"
"Who is responsible?" The answer is clear.
The world is the responsible. What would I do about this?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insoddisrupted, and you ask you who is responsible for the responsible is the responsible for you are you.
You could do better.
And with hundreds of different variety of available variety of the unsuccess.
So when people get decisions, even though the result is valid, they feel incomfortable and they give the hit to their own same.
In the last few years depression is exploded in the industrialized world
I think that a significant factor -- not the unique, but important -- of this hondipression is that people have deludent experiences because the standards are too alone.
And when they need to explain this situation that the belongst is them.
So the end result is that we are better, but we feel worse. But we feel worse.
Let me tell you about it.
This is the official dogma offical, what we all get for good and it's completely fail.
