The year I showed these slide to show that the glacial calculation that the glacial calculus of 48 million years has had the size of 48 States of 40 percent of the 40 percent.
But this is under values the gravity because it doesn't show the charge of the ice.
The art glacial calculus is in a certain sense, the heart heart of the global climate system.
You expands of inversus and weren.
The next slide will be a rapid rapid of the last 25 years.
The gaus lost are drawed in red red red there.
And as you see, you know, they expand the blue screen.
This is the ice in wind, which is the glacier.
You can see that the glacior perenness, five years or more, five years or more, it's like blood from the body.
In 25 years of it is going to be like this.
This is a problem because the scale of the art's result around the ocean where there are huge amount of carbon that there are huge quantities of carbon of microbies.
Remempt to the totality of the atmospheric warming from global warming that amount could raddop, super-ritore.
In some of the laka little deep in Alaska little deep metan water.
The professored Katey Walter of the University of Alaska has been rected with a team in a team in a team in the write of Alaska team of Alaska is in the winvere.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: Wow! Something is if we will be able to be able to even us.
A reason is that this exchange is that this termic scale surgery from the northern northern the northern northern the northern northern Greenland is that this terms of the northermal Greenland is that this exchange of the northern scale swalda from the norther.
This is a glacial riglacial regim.
The level, he had never reached the similar levels.
This is the Kangerlusaq, in the so-obest Greenland of the Greenland of the Greenland of the Greenland of the Greenland of the Greenland of the Greenland of the Greenland of the Greenland of the Greenland of the Greenlusa's west Greenland the Greenlusaer.
If you want to know how the level of the slide of the gather, it's where the sea level of the sea.
These corres are increasing rapidly.
On the other side of the planet: Antarcts, the biggest block of the planet.
The months of the scientists have dichied that the balance, and the glacior is in negative, and that is in negative, which is particularly done in the sheets of the isols in the sheet.
Equal in six feet of water in Greenlevel of water, like Greenland of the water in Greenlevel of the water in Greenland of the water in Greenland of the water in Greenlevel of water, like in Greenlevel of water, like in Greenland six feet.
Himalaya, the third of the glacium of ice block -- they see new lock of the glacia.
The 40 percent of the world's population was going to be a tiny by the scientist.
On the Ande: this glacier is the source of this city.
The led is increased.
But when you diminum the same across the same half to the water.
In California in in California is diminuths of 40 percent.
The hydrops are in crisis.
The predictions, like you have to be grave.
The growing growing in the world door a remarkable increasing in the world of incended.
The disaster is increasing a record out of the normal and without precedent.
Four times more number of the last 30 years of respect to the previous 75.
This is a whole thing of insustainable to be an instainable to be a remarkable of it.
If you look at the context of the story if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the point of the oriental Pacific area from the oriental country, and on the parts of the continent where there is a radical impoor, where there's a radical impoverimpose in the oceans.
The major of global warming deforestation, that is about 20 percent, which is the use of the 20, is the use of combines of fossils.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse even worse is even worse
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions, together in China.
And it was proposed to build many other charbon of the carbon
But we're going to assisting a shift of direction.
These are the annulled projects in the last years and some of the alternative verdies.
At every way, there's a political lotta in our country.
The carbon industry and oil industry have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon to promote clean that is a oxide oximum --
This image I reminded me something,
Natmal in Natmal in Tennessee, where there was a 3.8 billion gathers of choories of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of Tennessee, where I was a loss of 3.8 billion gathers of choorigines of choori
Maybe you have seen this guy --
This is the second biggest floflususes in America.
It happened around Natmaking.
The natalize, a natalia of carbon industry was this one.
Video: Man: Mong, the carbon is a kind of like and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is more and more clean is more and more clean.
It's precise to precise and workers are keeping the styaroung.
Al Gore: Do here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The biggest society on the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his amministrator.
Video: Don Blankenship: I'm going to be clear -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelogo, they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Proteam of Clima has launched two nice.
This is a shake of a part of it.
Video: All right, "ALery see the changes like a mine of climate changes like a minum of our business.
So our priority is invest a great money in a great money in a lot of money in a effort of the truths and confuses the truth.
In fact, the carbon is not spore.
We think it is clean -- it has a good fum.
So not predictables of climate change.
Let me do you get to us.
Video: All right, Carble--- you heard -- you heard a lot of talking about a lot of it.
So let's take a joyer in a structure of the framework for the carbon for clean to the carbon for clean to be a clean.
Straordinarily is a little nois! The machines are a little noise.
The carbon is between the main of global warming is in the global warming of global warming that you see changing everything.
You look at a eye -- this is the goal of the carbon of clean technology.
Al Gore: Finally, the high positive is connects to the economic and economic to the national security and the national security and the national security of national security and the national security and the national issue of the national security and the national issu
Video: M: Like is in crisis, the economy, security climate national crisis, the national climate crisis.
The film that college all of it, our dependence from the combinable fossil fuels, like carbon and the important.
Now, there's a new new audience, there's a new audience.
We have to be a lock of clean energy in a diech years.
They like to remove the work, makes it safer safer and helping the global warming the global warming.
Finally, a solution that it bought to solve our problems.
Repower America. It takes more.
Al Gore: This is the ultime.
Video: Here is is to red-energy to America.
One of the fast faster of the faster of the dependence from the dependence on our planet.
And, you know, the future is here. Vento, only a new energy network.
He shot -- you know, 2: Noves investment for places to be well retribes:
M: Man: Repower to be realists.
Al Gore: A proverbio African proverbio African old says, "If you want to go to the money to him, go to money.
If you want to go away from the way -- you know, you go away from it."
We need to go away, quickly.
Thank you very much.
The year last year at TED fect in LHC.
And you try to return to go back to the how the machine.
So you get out of it. And for those of the other time there is no erate, LH's is the biggest scientific experiment of the scientific experiment of circumstom.
Her belove, reconditions that were fewing less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
This is just just environment.
This is the Gineva.
We photographing these mini-Big Big Bang Bang Big Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Bang Bang Big Big Big Big Bang Bievators.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is a 44 feet and has a 22 feet and has a 22 feet of 22 feet of feet.
This is an image of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
The 10 sets of the last year we have accessels to the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immenses festating in the control.
It's an image of the first particles of particles that had done all the gyellow LHC, entering deliberately with a part of the LHC, and spread particles inside the reef.
In other words, when we were seen that picture the 10 set, we understand that the machine work, which is a great liftyle that is a great liftype of the words.
I don't know if it was to do it exultate about Google and he went to Google and saw that the beginning was this one.
That means we had a cultural impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact.
About a week later, it was a problem with the machine, had to these files here -- these movies here -- these movies -- these movies -- these movies -- these movies -- these movies -- these movies -- these movie files here -- these movies here -- these files are mothers in a problem with the machine, it was a problem with the dorates.
These movies are 13,000 prints when the maximum of power.
Now, technical technical of you will look at files and say, "It's not true. I'm not true. I'm too much under that we have too much under it."
And they can do it because when they are very cold of the superconvictor of the superconvicts.
So, at less 271 degrees, at a pound temperature in the star of the space between the stars, these movies can take that corrup.
In one of the most of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a defected.
So the movies surfaces they read up up and 13,000 printed printed to meet a resistance of electrical resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impression if you think that these magnets are about 30 tons of 20 tons and that were moved about 30 centimeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take a touch, what we had to do this.
We have repristinated and add them up.
They're going back to the place in the ground.
Enthy the end of the marze, the LHC will be new integrates.
We let me and we expect to get data to get data or juge, and continue so our wind or wells that are the matts that are the matts that are the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain in one way, these accidents reaccepting the debate on the value of science and engineering. It's easy to confuture.
I think that it is so difficult to be so difficult to the limits, I think is the value of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the words of a scientist of a Inglese, Humphrey Davy, which is defense in the inuseful inuseful experiments of his clear and the pollo was so dangerous to progress of the human mind as write for progress as the ideas that are presides in nature, and not us the world-defense monether, and the world-up sea trial world."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to reward here, from children, from children, played the morning.
And as you understand how to get them and reach them and resolve, you know, and learned and move them and resolving them and resolving problems and resolving relationships in space.
The reason is deeply connected to the way we understand part of the world around us.
So, from informing informed by using our interaction with physical objects with my consults, and my collaboratory collaborator Jeevan Kalaniths, I started to ask myself, "And if we use a computer, just to ask mouse like the mouse as a drum that moves on a horse of the mouse as a degital with a degital with both hands, you can realize information with both information with both information with with both hands,
and we will be able to our pleas?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided we would have answer to explore the answer to the answer Siftable.
In poor, a Siftable computers is a big interactive computers like a big.
In poor, a Siftable computers is a big interactive computers like a big.
You can move them with hand, they can move in them, "Like the movement and have a screen and a screen and a wireless.
But further, they are physical objects, like matter myself to be simply to rely recognize it.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of detect information.
And as they become more physical physical and and the other things, and the others, and as they become more fish and more physical stands of the right right right right now, we can exploring new style and fun and funness stiles of interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This is a Siftable to show video -- if you including video -- if you including the video it turns out of the other side back.
These are interactive ritritritritritritritritritritritritritrities of the others.
If they are doing them in the fact they are going to be around it.
If they come circumstomer and they can agthed a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
If they come circumstomer and they can agthed a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
They also have their movement and incline.
We then realized that one of the interaction was the power to use the data, the power to use the data, a color, "See of the purposes as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated as sea green secks, and I can use them to be in the central central colors in the central central of the color.
and I can use them to take them to be able to be central color, where they mix they mixed up.
If we can get too much of it, we can release a little bit about place.
They are also beautiful of learning, like the language, like the mathematics and games of logical and logical gics where people can try and see the results and seeing the results and seeing the immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacus that I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a game of words that is going to put in Scarabeo and Boggle.
Pratically, at every turn of every turn on every Siftable, Pratically, in every Siftable, Pratically, in every Siftable, and as you try to be able to deal with a ditionary.
And then after about 30 seconds remissing, and you have a new set of lects, and new chance to try to try to try to prove and new charge and new chance.
Thank you.
Here's the children came to the Media Lab, I did it and I have done in a video.
They were like to love it.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of applies is that you don't have to give people a lot of education.
You have to say, "Looks of words, and they know what to do.
Here's some people who tried it.
This is our most of the youngest beta young and right there.
It was actually going to be very large.
They were just charge, for him, for him.
Now, this is an application of a interactive application of a interactive application of a interactive application of a interactive application of a interactive application.
We wanted to build a tool for the appreciate languages is Felix.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, and he can spreading the Siftable to their associats.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, and he can spreading the Siftable to their associats.
So it's doing the sun.
Video: The sole is surgery is sun.
David Merrill: He's let a treat the scene.
Video: Man: The arancial treat.
Bel work!
So I get Siftable to schools can make the set of the characters --
Video: Goo!
and inventing their story.
Video: Cao!
DM: It's a story with an open and it can decide how they fly slides.
DM: It's a story with an open and it can decide how they fly slides.
Video: Vole, garm.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, recently detected to explain, and exech and execk music.
it's a tool, recently recently to sample, and execk music.
The Siftable here is based on the sound like basically and battery.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what to use to use it.
You can get these sound sound in a sequence, to be able to your please.
And to modify it simply to touch a "sound of sound."
These are effects that you can control from live and the film and the film.
The attacks to a particular and then including it to add it.
And then there are general effects like time and volum, which is applied in the sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We'll start with a base in two Siftable Siftable "sequenca," the system, we will system, the extending in a series, we add other base.
Now I put a baside line.
Video: DM: Oh addition --
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the movie on the bacteria, so I can control the effect from the face.
Video: DM: I know to fast the whole sequencing time from one side or the time from one side or from one side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the time from one side.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the movie to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombining the sequence, "volo."
So I didn't like to planning it before, but I can improvise, making it longer to make it longer a little bit more corta.
And finally, I can get the whole sequence, I can get the whole sequencing the Siftable to the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new man, new man-machine interface, how our brain and more look like our brain and cord.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of the results of this percord, and also some possible possibility that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to transmit you is that is coming to interact with digital objects to interact with digital media and information in our world that we want to do.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the now to talk to all of you.
I'm a write of a write of this.
Scry's books is my profession, but it's more than that, obviously of course,
It's also the love and the fascination of my life.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But I said, "This is particular happened in my life and career in my life and career in my life and career to recalibring the entire report.
The thing is that I recently recently this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Ama," why, I was going to be a different things, for some reason for some reason in the world and became a big sense -- and it became a big sense of interaction.
And the result is that everywhere from now, people are like if I conduct me as if I conduct to me as if they were conducted to me.
It true, convicted, convict!
They are not worried and they said, "You're not going to be able to do you can't feel more to do you than do that?
You can't fear to keep writing for all life without able to be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to somebody who can important,
that can be able to do somebody in the one?"
It's absolutely sure enough, you know.
But it may go worse I remind that I remember 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was an adolescent -- I wanted to be a trice.
I met to the same reaction of the same reaction.
And people said, "Don't you have successful to be success?
Don't you fear the upon rified you killed you kill?
You can't fear to do this mester to do this mester in the whole life without any swimming on a heart of skin a heart of saving south of sweet to love energy of flip flight?"
You know, you know, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is, "Si."
I have to be fear of all of these things.
I always had to fear of the wall.
And I also have a lot of other things that people may not have to mean to be inart.
As a algae and other things often slow.
But, for how much about the writing what I thought and I was a ultimely and I asked myself to be the dealing of the minds' I think, and I ask me to write what I thought and I was thinking about it and I asked me to write what I thought and I was a dealing about it and I ask me to write the one of the write I thought and I was the dealing?
Is it rection?
It's logical that anybody who have to wait to be expected by a job that it feeled to do.
But what is that we particular in the impresequation to make it in a mind of the mind of the mind of the other charges?
How my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and not rememical to be a chemical engineer in which he was asked if he was asked to be able to engineer capit?
It was never -- that that block of John, like what?
It didn't work like this, it doesn't worth?
Onestly, the engineers are not certainly in sease, in the century, the reputation of being alcohads to be highly equipment.
We have enough, we have enough this reputation, and not just writers but creative of every general reputation of all of that reputation of being enormously instable.
And it doesn't rest that look at tristage of the deaths of the magnific deaths of the magnitude of the winds, and often to them, they have young and often to them.
And the people who don't have suicide seem to be really displaced by their womens.
Norman Mailer, before I did, in the last of the last of the last book, "I have killed me a little bit more." Our extraordinary result of their life.
But we don't have to be able when we heard about because we heard these things so long that in some way we were completely interior in some way we were completely interior reality and the art and the art that the art and the art and the art and the art and the art and the art and the artor of the scia.
And the question I want to ask all of this is -- you know, I'm going to take this ide?
It goes to you have this thing -- because it looks like a centimeter of me -- it doesn't well good for anything that supposed to do this support --
I think it's hodious.
And I think it's dangerous, and I don't want to see it in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great minds of minds creative to live.
And I know that in my case, in my case, in my case, it would be very dangerous, to become out to that feeling towards that I feel the circumstances in my career.
It's a very young -- I look at it, I'm pretty young --
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very likely to be likely to write in now will be right now to the world like the work that used by the world as that was often, and it was going to be successful in my last book.
I'm going to sky, because we're all more or friends here -- it's probably that my most successful minds of the shoul.
Oh, Gesus, who think!
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start ball of the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to do this work that we do.
So, the question becomes from, you know?
And so it seeds, after many reflections, which the way to work to keep write is to create a psychological psychological psychological cool, right?
I have to find a distance of security in me, I am writing in me, and my natural ana, and my natural reaction of the react E, while I was trying to get out of the year to see if I started looking through the time in how to do it in the time to see if they could have the other societies to see if they could have the more healthy ideas and healthy and healthy to see if they could have the most healthy ideas and healthy as and security to the way to the way to the best ideas and seek in the way of
how to help people creative to help people to deal with the inerent inergence of creativity.
And that research was to the ancient and a lot of ancient and Roma.
And you see it because I gave it back to circle and then back.
In the ancient Grecia and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that the creativity is given by man, OK?
He thought that creativity was this spirit is about diving and that came to a few surface of a few surface and unknown and unconnected to distant and disconsciousness, and disconnected and unknown out.
The gree called these demons' divines of the creativity of the creativity of the creativity of the creativity of the "demone."
Socry, wonderful of having a demon that was a demon that was a demon the wisdom of long.
Romans were in the same idea, but they call that kind of spirit without a genius.
The one is great because Romans were not thinking that a genius was somebody particularly smart --
They believe that a genius was this kind of diving kind of the device, which was live in the walls of the study of a little bit like the art of the art of the art of the art and modeling the around, and modeling the account of that work.
Extional thing -- this is the distance of the psychological construction -- that psychological construction that psychological psychological psychological purposes from the results of your work.
And everybody knew that was so that it was so that it working, right?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things, like for example too narcissm, right?
If your work was exceptional wasn't you could get all the market, everybody knew that was helped by this genius to be helped by this genius to be able to do it.
If your job, it was not not cool, right?
They knew that was your genius to be a incapable of a inability to be a incapace.
And so people have conceived the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then Rinascise Rinascise and all of this idea; we put the human human being; we put the human being; we put the human beings and without leaving the creatures and without leaving the divinity.
This was the principle of the rational human entertains and people started to think that creativity is completely from the ish.
And for the first time in history, you start to refer this or that artist as a pretty genius like a person with genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error herror.
I think allowing somebody to believe that it is like a recipe of being like a recipe and the source of all my mysteries and the source of all my mysteries and ethern is a move or notice to be a move or too big, to be a move or too big, it's a lot of great to be a fragile of human beings to be like a fragile of the human beings, and a responsibility to be like a fold,
It's like to ask somebody to engine,
It completely and destroyed the ego and creates all these expectations on performance.
And I think it was this pressure to destroyed the artists in the past.
And, if this is true, and I think it is the question, and now?
Can we different thing?
You may be able to get more ancient understanding of the human relationship between human and mystery and creative.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't cancer 500 years of rational thinking, in a rational talk.
And it probably have people in the audience that would be reading to suspects on the notion that they follow the notion that they follow people who followed their projects.
I probably don't convincing you all about this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why is it?
Why don't you think it in this way?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that has ever heard to explain the exaspertant impredicability of creative process.
A process that ever has been trying to do something -- how to do something -- so fundamentally, all here -- it doesn't behave.
And, in fact, it can seemed to be completely paranormal paranormal --
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poeter Ruth Stone, who has now 90 years, but that was a poeter for life and he said that during his own life and he said that in the rural hands out in the rocket, and I feel it out in the wall, and hear it from the countryside of the countryside of the countrage.
He said that he was like a reaching air.
And that was going to be rotating to the landscape.
He feel going, because he was to make the earth under his feet.
He knew about to have one thing to do to that point and he was to do it and he said, "corrupt like a morn."
And so it goes to the house and was following from this poety and it would have to make another piece of paper and a fairly house enough in da, while the translate it and and slight-up and slide it on the page.
Sometimes couldn't be fast enough, so corrected, and corrected, and correck and the rolled rolled through and the rotate round through and she would continue to rotate through the country, and he would continue to rotate through the country, and he said, "another poet."
And then there were those times -- this piece of piece -- and there were no time that was the moments that was almost lose almost lose and good, right?
So, he was going to corrup, and he was trying to card and the poety was looking through through and short and he was going to go through and and he said, he was going to go and and hand and and and the off.
He was a poety of the cover, and the reputs in his body and the turns on the page.
And in these cases, the poety would be presented on perfect and intact and intact and intact to the first of the last word to the first major against the first of the word to the first major against the prie.
So when I feel thinking -- it's crazy to my process to my process to my process.
Not all my process creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a muly, and my way to work out is to work out of the same horor's orn every day and south and work and go on and get it up.
But even though I had, in my head, I slighted that thing, sometimes you know,
And I imagine that many of you have a lot of you have a lot of you can also be a lot of you can also have a lot of you can also have a lot of you of the han face.
You know, even if the job and ideas, I would come up with a certain funny I could not know it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to that in a way that we don't lose your head, but it makes us remains to sani?
So I realized in the best example of contemporary I have a musician that I have been several musician I interviewed in a day.
We were talking about that, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, the major the incarnation of the artist of the artist of contemporary articks, trying to control these species of clean interior incars.
But then he was driving up with hot and he was driving on a him, and he was driving on in Los Angeles, he changed all for him.
He was going to be quickly and a tiny tract of a lodia, that is going to be in his head, and the wind-half fold, you know, and wish and wish and wish wish and wish wish and wish well.
It has no paper piece of paper -- it has no mathemselves.
So it starts to feel this kind of old old old old old old old in the typical him, and I will get out of this song.
I'm not enough, and I can't do it."
And instead of going to stand up in the panic same.
And I'll put the whole process and he did something new completely new one.
He looked at the sky and he said, "Scuse, not you see that I'm dying to drive to the sky of my drow?"
"You seems that can write a song?
If you really want to exist, you know, in a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
Altriments, you go to the important.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process worked after this.
Not the work, the work was still done to the work as seeds.
But the process, and the weight that attement was released when the genius, the genius, the genius that would be a hundred of the problems and remained it from the coming from where it was coming to come from where it was an interior realized and returns out that it was an interior mind.
but well, this is a piece of piece of pieces a conversation between Tom and that weird and that weird and exern't.
So I feel that story about changing a little bit about how I was working and saved me a little bit of a time.
This idea, he saved me when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Ama," and fall of those class of the disperation in one of those disperation of the disperation in and we start thinking that will be a disaster that that will be the worst of the worst book.
Not just bad worst the worst book.
And I started thinking about designing this project.
But then I remembered me of Tom who talked to the air.
So I went to my face on the hands and I would say my comments to a corner of the room.
And he said, "You know, I said, "Yeah, well, both we know that if this book not not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not be brilliant to myself in my short, right?
Because as I see I'm going to put all of what I have to do with this.
So if you want to be better and you have to be best and you have to be able to do your partner.
OK. But if you don't do it, I don't do anything, I don't have to do anything.
And I'm going to write the same because my job.
And I want to flew that was recorded to me that I today is to do my part, because of the end is like to the end of the North Africa in the deserts of the North Africa in the North Africa in the country that was going to be danced for the dance, and and the sacred and the sacred and hours to the high hours and the hours to the albe.
And they were always magnized, because the ballers were professionals, and they were fantastic and they were fantastics.
But every single time, it was going to be really, and one of these arts became to actually transendent.
And I know what I know about what I know about it, because I know that you have all of the point, a lose lose of it.
He was like time you stopped and the ball, and the walking through a kind of lapse and was not doing nothing of different from the solite, like the 1,000 night before, but all of the ineavails --
And suddenly not appears just like a human human human one.
But you access to the diline and under in the divinity.
And when this happen, the time that was going to be able to the them, they were called his name.
They were junged and started to cant, "Allah Doh, God, God."
That's God, you know.
And they were going to be able -- when the Mors the south of the Spain, they preserve this habitude with their and pronounce, and he changed in the set of "Allah Allah Allah from "Oole, who's in the cords, which you can feel in the cords, or flew in the cords, or flew in the corres of the south of the cordings or the flexiety of the south of the south of the south Spurpose the south
In Spay when an artist has done something impossible and magic -- "Oh, ole, oh, well, stic, and behold, behold, and you know, -- a score, a score.
And it's great because we need to have to do.
But the problem goes the day down, the ballery of the ball, when you woose and discovered that they are the 11 of Martedday and the God is not more.
It's just a death, with a death, and maybe it can't be able to get more to the high to that height to that height to that height in that alish he's just a death.
And perhaps no one will be the name of God while I still have to do with the rest of his life?
It's difficult to be hard to be hard to be hard to be very hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to hard it.
This is one of the most dolorous reciliations to make in a creative life.
But perhaps it doesn't have to be so angotty much science if you can not believe it, and the most expects of your being being from you to yourself in your being from you to yourself to yourself in your being as you have.
But it was just that you get from a prestantly data from a source of this squisite part of your life that you have to spend somebody else when you fine.
And, you know, if we think in this whole way of change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it was surely like I thought for several months in the work of book that I public book I'm going to be able to prestantly in my great deal of my great degree dealthy of my great deal with my great deal with my great deal with my great deal with my great deal with the book, and it was really going on.
And what I have to continue when I feel electric feeling from this is, I don't fear that we have to fear that is not fear that we have to be fear with feeling --
Don't go to the ar. It just your work.
He really, it can be able to you have to be able to your partner to be there.
If your job is ball, ball.
If the divine, you know, when you would get some kind of device, you know, to leave some kind of wonderful time through your effors, then "Ole!"
And you do the same dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself itself.
I think we have to be teaching it.
"Ole!" to yourself, even for yourself to have human and heading to be able to be able to represent.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
And as you know I've talked about some of these projects on the human genome, on what can meaning and the discovered new set of genes.
We're starting a new lost of -- we started to digitalizing biology and now to degital code and now from that digital code of biology, and synthesizing and synthetizing and synthetizing and synthetizing and synthetizing life.
We always tried to take big questions.
"What is the life?" is something that many biology have been trying to understand various to various levels.
We tried to have several approaches, reduce to the minimes of the terms.
We're digitalizing almost 20 years hour.
When we sequenced the genome was to go from the world of the biology to the digital world,
We ask us, we can regenerate life, or create new life from this digital?
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the most smallest species of the tiny of the tiny that can autoreplicate in the lab.
And we tried to reduce ulteriorly the genome to create a little bit more smaller.
We're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the about 500 that are here.
But when we look at a methabolic map of metabolic map, it's relatively easy to the now.
And that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimine, one to the time, it's very unlikely to be able that this can bring to a live.
So we decided that the only to progress to progress to be synthesizing this chromosome, to modifying components to bring some of these foundations.
And so we started the wurn of the "Posze of "Posze a chromother?"
It can be able to make these big molecules that we have never been able to create before we have never been able to create before?
And, in case of real-mother chromodel to make a cromother of the major chromoom
A chromosome, it's just a piece of piece of chemical material inert.
The speed with which we are able to digitalize the life is growing in exponential exponential reals.
Our ability to write the genetic code of genetic code of the genetic code of it, but it's better dealing --
And our most recently recently results the results of the exponential recently recently
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of past, starting with a biothic revision before the first experiments.
But we found that synthesizing DNA is very difficult to be very difficult.
There are thousands of thousands of cars in the world that are DNA, the long equality of DNA, the long ethen, and it's a degenerative process of degenerative and is a long time is long, more error is long, more error is longer long, more error is longer than 30 to the world are going to be degenerative to be degener
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and correct them and correct them up.
And this was our first tentative, to particular information of the digital information of Phi 174.
It's a little virus that kill battery batter.
We have designed the fragments, effect correction of the errors and get a DNA molecule.
The interesting part of the interesting is when we took this piece of chemical material and we put it in the bacteria started to read this genetic code and producing this genetic code of virals.
The particles are then released by cells, they were released by cells, and they destroyed Els.
I talked about recently with recently oil industry says that they have certainly understanding this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his hardware in a biological system in a biological system in a biological system in a biological situation system that is a biological situation system to be build his hardware in a biological situation system in which the software to
But we wanted to do things in big things.
We wanted to build the whole chromosome.
I'm more than 580 mild-lectly lected.
So we thought about built it in cassetets of the viruses, so that we could change the cassets to understand what the cassetets are a living cell.
The design is crucial information and if we start with digital information in a computer, these are very accurate.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the accuratezation was a standard of a mile of a mibasic error for 10 miles away for the first 10 mibasis.
We have discovered, resequence, 30 errors. If we were used that sequence, we would never be able to do it work.
One part of the process is to design segments that are going to be able to build with all other segments of 50 lects of 50 lects to build under in the tiny of the tiny work.
We take elements ones here.
You probably read that we read in the big.
And think about what we have a genetic code genetic code of four letter: A, C, and T.
Three of those tables together with about 20 minoacid, and there's a specific order to lect of lect lects,
So we can use genetic code to write words, fraking, sides thinking.
What we did in the beginning was autographic to be autograph of it.
Some were deluses from the fact that it was not just poeking.
We have designed these segments to simply with the same things.
There are people that repect and they put them and put them together.
And we started to assembling of the particular segments from five to seven my letter to seven a segments of 24 miles away from 24 miles to come to 72 miles to come to 72 miles to 72 my letter to seven to 72 miles away from segments to seven my letter to seven my letter to se
We produced these danced set in the abundance so that we can sequence, so that we're trying to create a remarkable producing a tremely robustop -- how you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems the tabon a basic tabon of a basket.
When we get to these very longments, more than 100 miles -- more than 100 miles of the El.
You get to the limited instruments of the molecular biology of molecular biology.
So we have to be considered other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called recombination called recombination of biology to repaid DNA to repaid DNA to deal of the segments.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiodurans, it can be aware three million radiation.
You can see in the soil of the require as his chromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly how it was before.
They were able to do this.
These organisms can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to completely side.
They can live under eight.
I'm absolutely certain life exists in space and to find new environments of water.
In fact, NASA showed that this aven.
This is an image of the molecule that we built using these process, just using the lievidence with the design appropriate to inserious segments.
The lievidence them allowly.
This is not taken with a microscope, but with a microscope, but with a microscope microscope.
It's a big molecule, so big that we can see it with a microscope with a microscope.
These are pictures that covered a period of about six seconds.
This is the audience, we did a little time ago.
I'm more than 580,000 letting genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule, the biggest molecule ever created by man.
It has a weight molecular on a 300 million hons.
If we spent it with a 10 carefully carefully to take 142 pages to just transck this genetic code of this genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of this genetic code of genetic code to take a genetic code of a genetic code of this genetic code of this genetic code of this genetic code of genetic
Now, how do we work it work? How can we activate it?
Obviously, you know, a virus is a game is a game to be a game to be a game.
It's a little bit complicated when they use bacteria.
It's even simpler than the eucarios as our eucarios as our reds, you can simply the nucleum and they just put a clon.
In the bacteria for the archaea is integrated in the cell phone is integrated in the cell phone that we are able to do a complete transplant to a cromosome.
We can cromosome, a bunch of a microbial species --
The two are different how men are different than men of topis.
We added some genes in a few genes in a way that they could decide what chromother.
And it was slightly with the half of the proteins.
And when we put in the cells in the cells was stupend -- and you appreciate our softwo-sticatos is going to go into the cellule.
And we started thinking we couldn't go old, but we tried to be able to push us to push us to be there.
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution.
We discovered that a lot of species have added a second or a second or a third of a second or a second of a second thousands of new tracks to that species.
So who thinks about evolution as a gene of the kind of modific is not understood part of the biology.
They have the grip of restrial restrial is that degerish digerist DNA.
The chromosome, it was in cell.
The cell phone -- the cromosome, we have inserve insers, ha.
You can see it is expressed the other chromosome, as an extrane; it has masticed, and we found with only the cells and the new crum.
it became blue to the genes we put in.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a species are lost of a species of the new species of software that we put in the software that we put in in the cellule.
All the proteins are changed, the membranes and when we read the genetic code genetic code genetic what we have transfer to what we transfer it.
Now, this may seem like genetic alter, but altering the software DNA we can change the things in enough.
Now, I've already explained that this is not about genesis -- but to progress from three million years and half years of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of these digital process.
Why do I say that?
I think it's enough obvious when we think about our needs is the needles.
We're going to go from six billion and half a billion in the next 40 years.
Righust to give an example, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 194, in 1940 years, there will be four.
We're doing problems now to find food and food, water and clean and clean and banity, medicinal and ban.
It's going to be more harder to do it for nine billion.
We can get more than five billion carbon of coal, more than 30 billion barils.
He means a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to replace to replace them, it will be a huge challenge to be a huge challenge to be a huge challenge to be a huge challenge to be a huge of the type of biological processes to get biological challenge to be a big challenge to be a huge of biological processes to be a biological challenge of a ch
In the most of the whole of CO2 emissions from CO2 from these materials that finished in the atmospher.
Al day of today, thank you to scientific discovered in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that they are designed to be the design components for the future.
The electronic industry is just a dozen about components, and think about how many different things are coming out of it.
Our limites here are data from the biological reality and our imagination.
We have the techniques, thanks to these synthesization, in grab able to create what we call genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic genomics.
We're able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes in a day.
Think about processing these 20 million genes or to try to get the processing processes to produce the processes to make a little bit of vaccines, we can change and a little team, and create biology and create biology of molecular biology of science.
And it's just a standard lection of standard.
We can choose to survive, chemistry of survival, chemical production, chemical production, chemical production, production.
This is an instants of some software programmed on which we're working for search and designing species and designing species to computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they will be going to be no.
We know exactly what their genetic code of genetic code.
We're concentrying on the carbon of four-generation.
You can see you see that you extract out of the grand was an experiment in the bad.
We have a second of the second and third generation that will be used to be pretty soon as the sugar carbon as the tanol.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without major major major the consciously coast of food and limiting the CO2 in materials would be to turn CO2 in material that we're working for cells that can get out of the discover, and we could get out of the primate carbon of food that they can get out of the primate carbon of the discouple months.
The sunlight with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discovered in our world, we found different metodis.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean deep about 2500 feet of feet to the temperature of the water.
It rees build out of CO2 using molecular energy like source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can get CO2, which can easily be transported by maybe transported by your CO2 in carbon to drive that CO2 in carbon to drive this process.
So the short we think we could be able to increase what the basic question is Now, true, truly -- we have the modest goal to replace the whole industry to replace the whole industry.
Rightly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do it?
It would become a major source of energy.
First, we're working to use the same methods to create vaccines of instants.
You have seen this year with the influence, we're always backwards, and a dollar and a dollar in less when it is to find right now.
I think that it can change building vaccinable to change in the ancient ant.
Here's how the future could begin to seeming to change it, the evolution, accelting evolution, accelting the evolution, and indeed, and infinally indeed, and infinally indeed,
We're so much from the best people.
Our purpose is to live long enough to try to make it to make it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
First of all I'm going to show you the most quickly possible, some fundamental work that we have brought to Microsoft in a water in followed water in a year ago to be exactly a year ago --
It's a local that you can interact is a local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data from visual data --
We're seeing a lot of photos of digital photos with a kind of constant, and continuous for a speedck of the images like we want to him.
And it doesn't matter how big we see how much information we see how big we see how big these data or images.
Most are digital photographs but this for example is a detech of the Congress' is from the Bilibrary of Congresss' Congresss and in the gamma of 300 megather.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limited the prestations of a system like this is the number of place in any time in any moment. It's also an architecture of an architecture in any time.
This is a book of inter, example of data not images.
This is the Casa desolatator of Dickens. Every covery-represents a capite.
And to show you that is just about test, and not images, we can do something like that, to show you what it is about a real-representation of a representation of the head, not a picture.
It could be a little bit of a little bit of a book electronic book.
It doesn't take it away from it.
This is a more realistic example of a number of the Guardian.
Every image of the great image is the beginning of a section.
And it will be the pleasure and beauty experience to read the version of a view or a view or a newspaper of a newspaper of a lot of mecure.
We also have something with the angle of this number of this particular number of the Guardian.
We created a fasulla fasulla high -- much more higher than what it used in a normal audience, and we put in the normal of the content.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specific specific specific and even specific specific specific specific and even the specific specific and even specific specifies.
And that is really demonstrate some of these ideas to eliminate the limites of space on the screen.
We hope that means to put a pop on and other charges and other cheries that are not going to be necessarily to be necessarily to be necessary.
Of course, maping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And on this is not lose to lose time, if we don't mean that we have contributes to be able to give in this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. obpatial image of NASAA.
So we're going to go to something else.
This is actually actually from the websk; you can go to the webs; you can see it to see.
It's a project called Photosynth, which is two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research of the English Seady, a students of Washington with the aid of Washington of the Microsoft Seliski Rick Seliski Ricchrows of Microsoft Research.
And it's from the web, I gested by Seadragon.
You can see when we do this kind of screen that kind of screen that we can go from one image of the kind of experience to multiple experience in multiple --
But the collocaon the space of images here has actually an meaning.
The algorithms of visualization of the computers together, so that they correspond to the real places that you can get the real places that imagine -- all close to the Grass in the Grass of Montags of the Grass of the screwed by a lide-show showed space. Here is all the space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some environment.
There are a few more space space in the space
I want to spend directly to one of the original data set of Noahotosynthy -- and this is from a previous prototynthesian that we have done to show you what we have to work for the first time you -- to show you what I think I think, is really the clear technology, Photosyth. And it's not necessarily very much evidence that we have been looking at the web.
We had to concern about legal and saying.
This is a reconstruction of Notare Dond-pictures made by Flickr. Basta digitating Notare Dame in Flickr. and you get images of the types of the charge and saw -- and you can tell you about a picture that you have a picture of the arances that are discovered to this model of the model.
So they are all picked up by Flickr and they were all colleged in space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never think about to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratificing to receive this kind of accool here.
I think you can see that it is a lot of different types of focamer: from those photos in the SLR, a number of the types of the environment.
And if you can try to look at those strange.
Many are blocked, etc., etc.
It gets a few of photographs -- -- etcolor.
This is a Notre Dam's recorded in Notre Dam.
We can go from place, we can go from the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now taking from all of the interest memory of view -- and it is viewing the Earth, from all of the data together.
All of those pictures become college, most of the side of the side of the side of the side of the sket.
You have a model of the land that emerge.
Think about this as the modern of Stephen Lawler on Earth
It's something that grows in complexity as people using it, and the people use. And the vantages for who use.
Their picture is marched with other people.
If you get to contrast all these things are saying the name of these things says the name of Notare of the cedral-up set of all those dates, and I can use all those dates, and I can use how point of the data to immergs in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, and having a social experience of the kind of social experience of type and crossmode and cross-user.
Of course, a consequence of all of this is virtual virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth, collective, and from the plane and set and images and similes, but from the memories of collective.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I understood we? What your software going to conve us to do is that in a certain in the next years, all the photographs of the whole photographs anyone in the world will be practically college that you can take together?
BA: Yeah. What is doing is doing is to discover.
It's creating a hyperline, if you want to be in the images of hyperline, in images.
And it's doing it in the bottom of the content.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the recise of information that many of these images can have seen images of these images are going to be very interesting images of these images are seen interesting of these images that are seeding and so many of these images can have seen images of these images can be very interesting images of these images can have seed images of these images can have to be very interesting of these images can possibly interesting images of these images
And as you get a research of images on the web, you tell a sentence and the head of the web on the web images of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures on the web is a lot of information about the web images of the picture of the phot.
Now, what happens if that picture is a picture of your picture?
So the amount of interconnection, and the amount of recise recipes that is really enormous classical effect of the network.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the major when you travel and one of the research of the research is the power in who has no anti-informed the antial pasts of the past, the past, the step of the pleters, the drops from the pleter's left from the place to the plant of the plant please.
Basti is to think that slide Jaguar is still beyond the Mily, or that the Milky of the Inuit are still hyths of meaning to Himalaya, the buddy respired Dharmal the importance of Dharma, to remember, to remember, and the world in the world we live not sense in sense of the world that the world we are not sense in sense of reality, but it's just a model of reality, but it's just a reality.
the consequence of a particular choices of choices that our stirps has done, well or mallows or multiple generations ago.
And, of course, we all share of essential tracts of essential tracks of essential tracts of essential tracts of essential tracts of essential tracts of essential tracts of essential tracts of essential tracts of essential tracts of essential tracts of essential tracy.
We all enjoy it. We all procreive it.
We're objects, you know, begin of the beginning.
We have to deal inexors of death, so it doesn't surprising us and balliam, and it doesn't surprise.
We have an art art.
What it is the particular of the song, the rite of the dog of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the English forest of the Borneo, or the Voodoo of Haiti, or the Kai's desert in Kenya sect in Kenya section, the Curanderries of the Sahara.
He was my journey of journey in desert a month ago, or a yak in the vallator of the Everest, on the Everest, the mother of the world.
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of move in the world.
And, if you get a moment that it can give you hope.
And so we can see the world of culture of the world are a ragnacive and cultural life and cultural and cultural acs and cultural to the planet and it's important for the planet and is important for the planet like bioosphers.
And you can think about this rather cultural raise as an ethnos: and you can define the ethnose. And you can define the total ethos of all the concepts of the conceptising of the consciousness, intuitions in the consciousness, intuitions in the consciousness of the consciousnes;
The ethnose is the great patrimonurimoney in human human acity.
It's the symbol's symbe, what we can be in how inquisisite that we can be in how inquisite symbe.
And because the biosphere was freely consumed high-high-applied again and purpose and purposes --
No biologist, for example, it would say 50 percent of all the species is or the extinction of the extinction of the hypothesis -- in the most apocal, in the most apocal, in the most optimistic -- and not even close near to the most optimistic diversity.
The indict of all of this is, obviously is the perset.
When you were borned 6,000 languages on this planet.
One language is not just by a vocabolary or from a vocabolar.
One language is the sprawing of human spirit of human spirit spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit language.
It's the middle with which animal of every culture is in the material.
Every lingua forest of mind, a wine, a thinking, a thinking, a thinking, a thinking, a spiritual system of the spiritual system of the spiritual system of the spiritual system of the mind, a spiritual system of the mind, a windowine, a spiritual.
And of those 6,000 language, while we're sitting here to Monterey, at least half the half is not sussurround in the ears of children.
They don't get more teached to children, which means you don't get something that they have been dead.
What is more than being sad than being flight from the silence, of being the last to talk a language of the last tongue, not to transmit the wisdom of the kids?
This is a skin that was the one of some part of the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks of a mother and leads with swalks a sillabe of a language.
And I know that somebody will tell "Is it "Is it not better like this?
The world would not be a better place, if we were all the same language?" Benisy's there, then we talk yoruba. Parlic yoruba.
We talk to kogi.
You can find a tract thing that it means you can't talk to your language.
And I want to do you to make you a journey through the etner --
a little journey in the ethnose of what we're lost to give you a little journey of what we're lologing.
Many of us forget that when I say "different ways of exists of exists of exists of exists of exist.
We take for example for example of this bimbo in Amazon seven, the popular of the anaconda, that creates in the middle of the right right right in the west of the skets.
It's a popular that is not able to distinguisn't able to distinguish the blue color, because the time is identify in the forest, from which is identify in the forest, from which is identify of the popular popular color.
They have a strange language and a matheme of the realm "English, "English, you have to be a different language language language.
And all of this radices in the past, all of the way is that in these familiar families where they talk about six or seven languages because of the major seven languages are talking about a language.
They listening to listening and then they start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived in the Waorans of Ecuador Ecuador that has had the first contact of the first contact in 1958.
In 1957 mission of 1957 mission of a commercial contact of a fact that we have a fact that
They made up from the high photographs that were retased in a few of them who were retending that popular popular of the forest forest that this popular popular of the plug of the place forest.
They collect the photos from the ground and research a form or a shape or a figur, they kill out of the diable, and they killed that was the diable, and they killed out the diable, and they kill with the lances.
But Waorans don't knew about the stranganiers.
They kill them in between them.
Five percent of mortality was because of their own own own for their own own own own there.
We are saving to eight generations and we found two houses of natural and when we insisted for know, they love that one of them was so that he died that one of them was dead, and then they kill it down, and then they kill it up. And then they kill it up. She had a knowledge of the forest forest in the forest of the forest forest that they had a knowledge knowledge incredible knowledge of the forest
The crums were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species of the species.
In the first '80s, I was assigned a very interesting compiece of when my professor of Harvard was asking me if I wanted to go to Haititi in Harvard to intrupholars in the first years of Duvalier and TontMacoutes, and myself to make the sugerads of the sessor.
To give a sense to miracle -- I had to understand the Vodouble, and that Vodouble.
It's pretty much of a complex metaphors of the world.
Very interesting things.
If you ask you to tell me the big religions of the world, what would you say?
Cristianesim, Islam, Budddhyo, Ebraism, etc.
A continent is always left out of the sub-saharian is not religious, and he didn't have feades of these religious. And the Voodoo is not that the distill. And the Voodoo deep that religious tragics in the slavery of the slavery of the slavery of the slaverism.
What makes you interesting in your life and death, is the intense of life and death.
So you have to live the spirits.
You can be invested by the Grande Aqua, they answer the dance of dancy and replacing temporary in the dance, in the south of the way that for a short of the following is the dio.
So your hodoodoodooists love to talk about God.
We go in the temple, and we become God."
And from the moment you are going to be driven you drive you drive you drive the male?
So you have to be able to these incredible events of the excited voodom that touches are involved a dimotion of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power when it's catalyzed in one of the state of the right when it's catalyzed in a state of extremely excited extrement in a state of the power of the mind when it was catalyies of the power in one state of the world
And all the people that have lived with which I lived the most extraordinary Kogi of the Sierra from Santa Mars, in the Colombia set.
It was going to be able to craws of the ancient that they live on the planet that Colombia in attention to the conquer in the conquer of the conquery, the population that you were going on on on the planurn on the planurgs on the planurge.
In a continent of blood of blood that is never been conquer by the spagnow.
And all of the today are governed by a classroom, but their formation is really extraordinary.
The young people are taken from the family to three or four years, and they live in a world of good and they live in a world of good and bombs in the glaciers to 18 years.
Two nine years of nine years of proposed to reproduce the nine months that spent in the middle of the mother, now I'm metaphorically in the utery of Grande Mad.
So in the time, they get acculated to the values of their society, values that they pret. They pregave them and their pregain and their praying balance, or better than to say the equilibrium.
And in the terms of this incredible beginning, they are suddenly cared out and for the first time in life in the age of 18 years, they see an albe. And that active away from the first wrong wrong of the beautiful den backyish of the beautiful country, all of the beautiful des of the beautiful counter. The pretty much beautiful pretty much of the beautiful des of the beautiful ded,
"Right? I say how I have to tell you about it.
It's stuff at you protect it."
They call the most of the biggest brothers and they say that you know, the drugs, we're the working of the destruction of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think about the population and the environment of the environment and the old history of the noble history of the noble noble that is a range of the nurse and we say that these popules are closer to the Earth of the Earth of us.
The indigenes are not feeling feeling of our algia.
There is no space for these things in the malari's palupon the wind gelies of the Tbet, but because of the time and they created a mistic mistic of the Earth is not about the concept of the Earth is not going to be able to be able to be live because it's infusing to the Earth can live because it's infuses just because it's infuses to human beuses to human being.
What does it mean?
And when you say that a guy of And, that grows is growing that the mountain is a spirit of Apu that will be a destiny human beings will be a deep human relationship with the mountain different mountain a lot of different mountain a little bit of a girl of Montana wheever a mountain a mountain a mountain a mountain a caves of the mountain a bunch of the mountain a ske.
It is the dimore, or a mineral hunright-mineral is irrieving.
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the metaphor and the natural world and natural world,
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia growing forests that they served to be cuted to be cute.
And he realized me to be different from my friends who believe that the forests are the forests that the forests are the Hukukukuk and the wells of the paradiseases that live in the world, and the dogs that live in the world, and the cancers that are living in the Hamatsa.
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality and understand their discoveries of sensations. We take this plant. We take this plant thing.
I took this picture to ape the norms of the normn Amazonidental
Maybe some of you have heard about ayax, the most powerful psychoactive psychoacy of the repertor skills
What makes it fascinating the across the ayaxis not the potential to the macological powers, but his elements is compoor. It's compoor.
On one side, this lian liana line of beta-carbine, harmine and harm, harm, lawer and harm, reading slightly hallucinogen.
Prending the only plant is a blue smoke that alter, and it is a little bit of consciousness, but it's just choices of a hundred of a house of the coffee of the coffee of viridis.
This is a plant contish powerful set, very similar to the servotonina, dimethoxietime -- 5, methoxime.
If you ever see Yanomami Yanomami to the nose the sustance, which is a different species, which is a lot of different species, cheap methoximmmethoxim.
To be that wells on the nose is a little bit like being sparated by a little bit of a distandle of paintings and land on a mand to land on a mand reality of reality. It creates a distory of reality. It creates the reality.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who has scated, the man who has scated, with his discovered with his discovered with his psychedelics in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in the 1930s in the 1930s in the 1930s in the 1930s in the '30s in the 1930s in the '30s in the '30s in the 1930s in the 1930s in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in the 1930s
Second my testhesis you can let these triptamines like hallucinogens because if you're done cannot telling anybody to be able to tell anybody of being sleeped in the wind, and they can't be money, because they are money, because they are monoddly monox.
It's possible to assummers just if I asked with other chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical chemices that are the MAO.
Now it's the beautiful beautiful meeting is in this lian is the bitors of MAO, the same kind of needed to potentiate trips to potentiate trip. The question of 80,000 species of plants, like these popules of popules that are going to find two deaths of the deaths of the particular defologistly not similar, but if you get a biochemical version of the particular way?
We use the great euphemism of proof of the proof of the proof of the proof of the proof the sket.
But if we ask to Indians, they will tell us "The plants will tell us about year."
What does it mean?
This tribe, Cofan, has 17 variety of ayaasca, that they distinguish in the forest of the forest in the forest and our eyes would be in the same species.
If we ask them how they are going to tell them how they will tell us "I thought about rest understanding of plant, and I said, "No."
The solution is -- they take 17 variety in a night of a plena and each dog and each dog with a different tun.
With you don't have Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to be able to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to Harvards.
Now, the problem is that the problem is that the people who have to cue the people who have to get prices and some of the marine of the history of the history of the respect to our real world and spent away from our real world and spent to our real real world and spent on our real world and spent away from the world and it can be pitching the world and it goes to our real world and in the real real real world's real-to-sea pitchers.
In fact, in 300 years, 300 years, it's going to be remembered for the wars or the innovation of technological innovation and the innovation of the biological innovation and we have haboted and we have been constantly accepted the destruction of the biological diversity and cultural destruction is not change.
All cultures through the century are involved in a dance for new possibility of life.
And the problem is not technology.
The Indians have not stopped to be Sioux when they put out of part of the Americans are not stopped to Americans have no messages to be Americans when they put out of the horsee.
It's not the change or the technology that they threat the integrity of the ethness of the ethnow.
The fact of the domination.
And if you look at the world, you will discover that these are not destiny destined to disappear.
They're living and dynamics out of the dynamics out of identify that will be beyond their ability to adapt their ability to adapt in their adaptary.
And that is that you can get in the patrie of the guys of the guys --
a popular population of Sarawak, in the south of the asian that has lived in the forest of the forest in the forest of the river, and now reduced to the river, where you can see the river, where you can see the rivers of the rivers that seems to be a honest in the middle Borneo towards the Meridionte, where the hort the dionesthesis illumine in the diongesnavo-the-like honte,
print in the forest styles with the underneath of the forest.
Or in the case of the Yanomami, are the diseases that are coming with the discovered of the hour.
If we move on the mountains of Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research that during the face of political domination of political domination
As you know the genocide of a population, physics of a population, but the ethnocide of the universal style of the style life of a popular popular environment, not just conducting in certain the environments, because it makes part of the developing of developing developing developing the ping of developing of the developing of developing developing the pment.
And you can't understand the suffering suffering of Tibet until it beginning.
I lost the 6,000 miles away in China in the Western China in the Western Cina and the Tibet with a young young and college, but only came to Lhasa I understood what we have to feel about.
6,000 world-sacred monuments in wild and crashes and crashes and crashes and well.
1.2 million people killed from military in the Cultural Rvolution in the Cultural Rvolution

The dolin of Tibet can be unabout, but the spirit of the popular is from tender,
And it down, it turns out to a choice.
We want to live in the world, or we want to live the world, or we want to act the world of diversity?
The great anthropologist, before he died that his greatest fear was that his greatest fear was that in our world, in our journey was that in our world, we don't just see the whole gamma of human imagination in the world, but a day day we can see it from a sleeping a day -- and a day we can be other possible.
And it's ur to remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Rvolution Rvolution that has given us agriculture, which has done us to the seeds the seedly, replacing the charge of the slide of the slide of the specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrialized world has 300 years.
That slide story not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal in the millen.
When these myria's culture of the world is asked what it wants to say to be humans, they answer with 10,000 voices different voices of the world is asking to 10,000 different voices of the world is asked.
And it's in these answers that we all answer the chance of being what we love -- a consciousnes: a species that we have to do all the popules and all the challenge. And there are big time of optimism. And there are great time of optimism.
I took this picture on the northern extremely in Bol of Bface when I went to the Inuity, and this guy, Olaya, he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather.
The canades of the canadesequed with Inuit and in the '50s to the '50s to stabilive our sounds, we have rhinkers.
The grandfather of this guy is refused to go on.
The family, temping for his life, and he took all the arms, and all his attrect and all his attents.
You have to know that Inuit doesn't have cold cold, they don't have the freeze,

He sliped on the salive on the dot of this caccepty and when it was solid, has killed a dog.
He has a bunch of the dog and created a brille, with the cassrowing back another dog and it's disappeared another dog and it's disappeared on the banks, and it's disappeared on the banks,
We want to talk about horse with nothing?
In the opened 19999 the canades has redded to the Inuit the control of a total territory of the California and Texas a of English and Texas together.
It's their new patria. It's called Nunavut. It's called Nunavut.
It's a territory of independent resources of mineraries.
One of explaining example of how a nation-state can reconciliar with his popular popular with his popular popular of the popular
And, finally, I think it's pretty obvious obvious at least to the planet, remote that they don't remote that they don't remote that they don't remote.
For somebody is home.
Rappresents of human imagination that they risallow up to the high of the theme of the kids, like the skin of our children, as the wells of our kids, become part of the hope.
Finally, we are convinced in National Geographic we're convinced to nothing to nothing to nothing to nothing to nothing.
We think the polemy --
[Applausive, they don't persuasive, but we think the stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best institution, and maybe we are the best institution, our websites of our website.
156 Pathesis transmitting our phone canal channels.
Our views are letter from millions of people.
Our work is to travel in the ethnose to take our audience in the half of the wonderful cultural place from which they will go on and saw and hope, they will hope to reveal the central anthropologists to exists in the diversity, and we need to find a style plug in the diversity, and multical multicultural life in a world pluralist, and multical pluralist.
in which the wisdom of all the popules can contribute to our well-being to our well.
Thank you.
And I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope to be able and try to try to evidence some college, in the case doesn't have them in the case of the nack them in the case of the things that I hope to be able to tell you about the collegments in the case I hope to tell you about the college and I will be able to try to see some of the things that you have heard of the things that you have heard of the connect in the case of the things that you have heard about the connections of the connections of the collegagagagagagurees,
I want to start with what I call the office.
The dogma dog, the office?
The dog, officer of all the industrial society of the Western societial dog, "If we want to massimizing the well-being of our citizen citizens."
The reason st, from a side, in fact that the freedom is in the fact that is preciout, essential for human beings.
On the other is that if we are free, one of us can act to just connect to do all the way to do all the way to do all of our well-being, without no one that decide in name our well-being, without no one that decide in our name of our well-being, and not one that we are liber, and not one of us to do what we are free to do all of our well-being, and not one of us to do what we are liber,
The way to massimizing liberty is to male the choice.
More people choices people are liber, more liber, and most of the freedom, more of the freedom, it's their being.
These are so deeply radicated in society that no one would dream of put it in two-fold.
And it's also deeply rooted in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress.
This is my supermarket. This is not particularly big thing.
I allowed a simple named on a saved save.
In my supermarket are 175 conments, without contributing 10 variety of oil and 12 acets of the bals' walsksets you can buy to give you a huge number of condition, in the souldn't be seen to the skets in your background of your degree.
This is the supermarket.
And then you go to the snegotio to buy a stereo, sleep, sletter CD, radio, plast, printing rector set.
And in this single of electronic snegotic number of components are audio number of components
We can do six million different and half million different combinations using components that there are in a negotial.
You have to admit that there's a lot of choice.
And you know, the world of communications.
One time, when I was a child, you could get all the services, they could get all the services, packs, pack-like mom Bell.
He read the phone is not buy it away from the phone, they didn't buy it.
One consequence of that, in the other one was that phone doesn't rop.
These are gone to go.
We have a variety of phone of the phone of the phone of the phone of the phones.
Here's the cellphones of the future.
My favorite is the middle of MP3, the sket, and force in the basis for the crus.
If you don't have seen in the house, you have seen in the case, you're beautiful trying to predict it will be pretty much to predict it will be pretty much in the case, you're going to be able to predict in the case of the house, you have seen in the case of the house, you can't see in your house, you have seen in the house, you're not seen in the house, you're going to predict in the sket.
And what happens is that people go into the negozes in the negozes and does this question. And what is the answer?
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much of it.
So, in other ways, in other ways, in other aspects of the water is the same explosion of choice.
Assistance, not happens in the United States that you have to be from doctor and the doctor and the doctor you have to do.
And you walk from doctor, and the doctor says, "OK, we could do A, or B" ""As these are welling these risk," "B" and these risks, "B" and these risks. What do you want to do?"
You say, "Doer, what would I have to do it?"
And the doctor says, "It's about these and these risks, and you have these risk." And this is well-and well."
"What do you want to do you to do?"
And you can rebate it was to me, what would you do?"
And the doctor, "I am not le."
The result is called "the malato," expression that it makes it seems a beautiful thing.
But actually, it's not a weight and responsibility to take decisions to take decisions from somebody who knows anything that it doesn't know anything -- and almost certainly is not -- and almost certainly is disease, and so in not in the ideal conditional decisions to take the patient.
There's a big marketing of products from drugs, direct to people like and you, if you think about it has no sense, it has no sense, it has no sense, that we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy them, because we published them there?
The answer is that they want you doctor of the doctor to change the recipe of changing the recipe.
Something that is a fundamental issue of the horse is a choice, like you see in this viewed to the children. We don't want to force the right right now.
And we can reinvent us how many times we aggrade us again in in the time.
The means that every morning, you have to decide that kind of person wants to be able to be there.
Rember at the family and mathematic, a time perspective -- and a lot of time -- he was that it was that you could get the most pretty much as possible, and he started to get the most pretty possible, and it was starting to the pretty much as possible.
The only true is choice with choice -- not here, and even what to do later.
Ogame, all is really to play to play
I mean, very smart at very smart for 20 percent of work in less of work in less than a time.
And because they're not brilliant because they're not less diligent.
but why I'm impensive to ask them, I said, "I should have to ask me or no? I should do it now?"
"I should be able to get more tardi? I have to think before the children or career?"
They're interrogative gatives of logorian.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this imply doesn't completely compity, and not get a good vote to my example.
And they have to do this. I'm really important questions to do this.
Now, the work: we are lucky, like Carl arl technology allows us to work every day, every day, from every day, from every single of the planet, tranne that from Hotel Randolph.
To speak is a corner, and I'm not going to tell anybody where the Wids work.
It doesn't tell you why I want to use it.
What does this mean this incredible liberty of choices that we have to decide, it continuously continuously in every moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our best kids to play how, with the mobile phone, and the Blackberry in the high, and the news of the eye.
And even though they're all spent, every minute that we see our child that we see our child to win the game, we're also asking this called "Maaaw?"
"I have to answer this email? I have to abboard this letter?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes experience experience the game, very different from what it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of any part of it, little things and big materials and big objects and stily and life, life is a choice.
Once the world was this: Ove, there were some chance, but it wasn't a choice.
The world today is like this: "Ilemma is ""Is" or negative negatives?"
The answer is Something is She's Sh.
The positive side of them all of the negative negative negative negative negative negative slides.
This is all about two negative effects of negative effects on people.
The first one is that they are going to be libering paralysis that liberation.
And many options of the things that chooks and it becomes very hard to do it.
You want to give you an example of meant -- a study conduct on the plans of voluntario.
A lot of my college has access to the data of the Vanket, the gant society with about a million clients of folded in 2,000 different companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are going to be offered in the more, the percentage of adesion.
With 50 sources there is 10 percent less than they were available to when they were available to only about 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources that chooks is maledetail, and choice, and choices is remained to indequestions.
And the question and asking questions, and of course, questions and questions don't have to be there.
You know that they don't just mean that these jobs are going to be able to food for cans because they don't have enough money, it means that the decision is so ostic that the decision is so ostic that they lose the foundation of the work.
Don't shot to 50, they're losing to 50,000 dollars per year from the data, that would be well to be able to experience them.
So the paralysis of having a consequence of having choice.
And I think it is the world like this.
"And finally, for the eternity: ketchup, or major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major majjores?"
You would take the right decision is to take the right decision if it's for ethis?
You don't want to choose the wrong found, and neps the wrong condition.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we could avoid paralysis and make a choice, we are less sodddiscovered of how we will be with less of the options that you would have choose to feel on which you choose to choose the parals.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of condition, which you can have to chood, if you buy one and it's not perfect and it's not perfect to be able to make a different choice. And what happens is that alternative imagined in the halternative imagine of choice, and the rescreened the choice, and the recognized the sofection of the choice, and the choice,
even when it was a very good decision.
More choices are easy to be able to details of any details of choice.
Inother, there's what economists call cost-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asked very well stamack of the value that we are going to depend on what we confront with it.
You know, when there are many options of the options of the characteristic characteristic careists of the options of the options of the option that you have choice.
Here's an example. I sent with all of the people who are not New York.
But it's what you probably thinking.
There's this courages to Hamptons.
A place of slight-place place of sweet ske.
It is to splendid. Ottim of day. It's all for them.
Not nothing that he thinks is "Well, what he thinks is Agostop is Agosto."
"Everybody neighbors in Manhattan are vie."
"I could talk about my front of the front of the house."
And it spent two weeks from the idea that it's losing -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants to be there.
The cost-opportunity demines the decreation for what we have to have been excellent.
And the more are the opportunities we have to be looking at the most of characteristic feeling how it cost-opportunity.
Here's another example.
This visit says a lot of things.
It talks about the moment, and maybe in live slowly.
But the most important point is that any thing you choice, you choices you choose not to do others.
The things that we don't choose that we have a lot of four that can make less attentially what we do.
And I suze, you know, growing of the waiting for waiting for the waiting.
I tried on my skin my skin a couple of jeans.
I was almost jeans.
Once the jeans were just a type, and they were belong, they were dissimis, just after they had to be comfortable to have a lot of a lot of times, started to go well.
So, I went to buy a new couple of a couple of new jeans, and he said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cuteans, this is my cut."
The coming became up with me "You want them to slim and fit?"
You want to do you to do it or with the bottons "Stones? "Stones?
"Li wants to room you go.
"Of them out of the brows or stretch, and you know, the blap --
I was sleeping and after a little bit I was able to say, "I want the only kind of charge, which was the only typothen, so for my own own maleans, so I tried to all of the maleans, and then I tried to all the way from the negotie, with the best couple of jeans, and the best jeans, and the best jeans that I had ever ever ever done had.
He was the mye. It was the mess. I had the basic measured me."
But I heard about it.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worse with all that choices were altising my aspects, the jeans had to be perfects.
And I was expectly minime. I didn't expect when he was existing a type of 100 different in in the type, at least one guys had to be perfect.
What I had water was good -- but not perfect -- but not perfect.
After the approached what I was trying to get to insoon to waiting to waiting to waiting to way.
The add of options in life of people don't forget the expectations that these have respectacs of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options that are going to be expectations to expectac
And this will be less soddisftion, even when the results are good to be good to be good to be good on.
No one in the world of marketing if you make it content.
Because if you know what I'm talking about, you know, what I'm talking about.
The truth is more about this.
"You was better when he was worse when he was worse when he was worth worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was still to meet the surprised of the surprise.
And day in the world we live -- opulent, industry, industrialized by the waiting with the waiting -- the massive that we can hope is that we can hope is that the things are the things that are the things are going to be expectancy.
You can't have ever surprised because your expects, my waiting, my waiting, my waiting, and they are ingigant.
The secret of happiness -- whose here is -- "Baspectancy -- "Yeah, it mean."
I want to say -- little bit of auobiographic -- which I really am and my wife is really stupend is really stupend is really stuff --
I couldn't have any better, I didn't have to do anything,
But you can tell you about it is a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of jeans of jeans when there is just that kind of jeans is that when you're not satisfied and ask you "Why?"
Who is responsible responsible for the answer is clear to clear it.
The world is responsible. What could I do about it?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a jeans, and you ask you who is responsible, and you ask you who is responsible to you are there.
You could do better.
With hundreds of variety of variety of the successful inherent.
So when people take decisions, even if the outcome, even if the result is walking and they feel unsatisfied and they get the chole.
In the last years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think a meaning that a meaning -- not the unique, but important -- this is not the unique, but the people have experiences in deludings are too high.
And when they have to explain this situation thinking that the colp is there.
So the final result is that we are going to be a better -- but we feel worse we feel worse it.
Let me tell you about it.
This is the office, what we all take for good and it's completely falso. It's not true. It's not true.
There is no doubt that a little bit of choice, and better that I don't have a lot of choices that many choices that many choices is better than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a choice.
There's a critical value, magic value. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have super-sure we have on a piece of the level that choices are going to be our life.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost -- I have almost -- from the point of view is the following point.
What it allows all this choice in society is the recipe of industrial society.
