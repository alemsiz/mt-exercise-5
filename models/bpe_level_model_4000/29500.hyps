Last year, I showed these slides to show that the slides, that the calculus that the calculus that the calculus have the size of 48 United States is continental of 40 percent.
But this subvalue of the problem because it doesn't show the pink of the ice because it doesn't show the ice of the ice.
The article calculation is, in a sense, the heart of the global climate.
You expand you get into the summers and return it into the summer.
The next slide is going to be a quick relled in the last 25 years.
The ice local of them are signed in red.
As you see, they expand they expand it up to the Europe
That's the ice in the winter, which is return into the summer.
You can see that the cheap ice of five years or more, is like blood, five years is like the blood, which was from the body.
In 25 years has been from like this, like this.
This is a problem because the re-scale issues of the ground, which is really really going to have a lot of carbon congeled carbon -- that skydial -- that sheet is transformed in the meter of the microbial ws.
It respect to the total inquination of global warming, that amount of global warming, that amount of it may double, super-returning point of not return.
In some deeper in Alaska little bit of the metan is already rebolling from water.
The professoral Katey Walter Walter of the University of Alaska slke -- a low-grab team --
Video: Wow! Al Gore: She is good. The question is if we are also going to be there.
A reason is that this is that this termic exchange from the Groenland, and the north.
This is a glacial record.
The laid had never reached levels.
This is the Kangerlussuather Kangerlussuaer in the Groenland,
If you want to know how to be the sea level of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice here is where the sea.
These currents, they're going to be increasing rapidly.
On the other part of the planet.
The last month of the scientists have been said that the ice of the ice is negative biland, and that the Western Antarcticking, which is particularly quickly in some issues of the ice issues are going to sheet down.
It is six feet of water, like in Groenland, like in Groenland,
Himalaya, the third largest block of ice, you see new laghi, and see a few years ago were glacier.
40 percent of the global population was going to get half of the pounds of the pool.
Sulle Andelle is the source of drinking water in this city.
The door is increased up.
But when it decreases down, the same thing is going to happen to water.
In California nevada is 40-percent.
The hydrodrops are in crisis.
The predictions as you have ready, they're grave.
The safe growing in the world door to a remarkable increases of prevent than than the wildlife is a remarkable of the world is a remarkable to a remarkable note.
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and unprecedented it.
Four more numbers in the last 30 years of respect precedented 75.
This is a whole whole thing that is unsustainable.
If you look in the history of the history of the history of it can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the East Pacific, from Americh, in the Americh, and both of the subway to the subject of the subject of the subject of the continent of oxygen in the oceans.
The biggest cause of global warming, with deforestation, which is 20 percent, is the use of fossil fuel fuel --
On oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions, with China.
And it was proposing a lot of other central central carbon central carbon.
But we're looking at a direction of direction.
These are the projects that are annulled in the last few years and some evidence.
At every way, there's a politics of our country.
The carbon and oil industry have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon clean clean carbon oxymore.
That picture took me --
Very Natal, in Tennessee, where I live, there's been a 3.8 billion gallons of carbon dioxide dies.
Maybe you saw it on the news of the news
This is the second big flow of scories in America.
It was going to Nat.
The natalization of one of the carbon industry was this.
Video: It's coal ♫ ♫ Frosty carbonaio is a kind of hallegry.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty carbonaie is more and cleaner and more cleaner.
It's good price, adorable and workers are getting the skillers of them.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of carbon West Virginia.
The biggest company on mountain society is Massey Coal. This is his friendly.
Video: Don Bland, and I'm going to be clear -- Gore, Nance, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for the Clima has launched two campaigns.
This is a part of it, a part of it.
Video: ALere: First we see the climate changes as a nith-in-threatens as a nighty nightforward.
So this is the priority is to invest a lot of money in a sweet in a remarkable reception.
In fact, carbon is not sport.
We think it's cleaned -- it has a good profume.
So not preocupedly of climate change.
Let me do it.
Video: Atte: Carbone: Can clean -- you heard a lot of it.
So let's do it a round of a structure to the structure of it as a clean as a cleaning carbon as a cleaning carbon as a cleaning cooke.
Straordinary cars are a little rotes! But this is the sound of carbon technology of clean;
The carbon consume is between the main cause, global warming, but the remarkable technology but the remarkable technology that you see it changes everything.
To look at this is the odier's odiera.
Al Gore: First, the positive alternative to economic issues to economic issues and the national safety of national security.
Video: Comment: Look is in crisi; the national security of the national security.
The file that the whole connects -- our dependence from fossil fuel fuel and oil and oil oil and oil oil oil and oil oil oil oil and oil oil oil mate.
Now, yet, there's a new solution for circles.
ReAmerica: 100 percent of clean energy -- in 10 years.
A plan to re-up the work, make us safe, to help us to make sure and help us stop global warming.
Finally, a solution that you make our problems.
Rear America. Scover of it.
Al Gore: This is the ultim.
Video: Commandment: It's about returing energy to America.
One of the fastest ways of bring to the dependence from fuel dependence that they kills our planet.
Comparsa: The future is here. Vently, sole, a new energy.
Compart is two: 2: Novi investment for good work work.
Comment: Rear America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old proverbial African says, "If you want to go fast, go to the waste --
If you want to go further together."
We have to go far fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED I did a TED introduction on the LHC.
And I promises of return to you to update to you on how the machine.
So I have. And for the ones that the other time is not the LHC is is the biggest scientific experiment -- 27 miles of circuit -- 27 miles of circuit -- 27 miles of circuit -- 27 miles of circuit --
Her job is to reach the conditions that were present less than a billions of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
And this is just the environment.
This is the machine machine is the Ginever.
Let's do these min-Big Bang in the relevel.
This is what I work. It's called ATLS -- it's called AS -- it's 400 feet and has a 22 feet.
This is a spectacular picture of ATLS in building so you can see the proportion of the proportion of it.
We have the 10 secember of the last year we accept the machine for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immense immense in control.
It's a picture of the first particles of particles that had done all the LHC, entertained in collision, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spreading particles inside the relevel.
In other words, when we saw that picture the 10 secember, we realized that the machine works, which is a big living.
I don't know if it was that to do more opaths than that, when somebody went to Google and vide that the beginning.
That means that we had a cultural impact over the scientific impact beyond the scientific impact on the scientific impact of the scientific impact over the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact beyond the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact on the scientific impact on the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the
About a week, there was a problem with the car, and had to have this whole thing here -- these files here -- these files -- these files -- these files --
These files take 13,000 amps of them when the machine works at the massive of power.
Now, technics between you look at the files and diranness, "It's not true. It's not true. It's too much underlying it."
And they can do it because when they are very co-fresh filters.
So, at least 271 degrees, at least 271 degrees, these files can bring that currently to the space -- they can bring that current.
In one of the junctures in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the files are going to read read read and 13,000 amps suddenly met a electrics.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive if you think these saving weight more than 20 tons in the red, and that have been moved about 30 centimeters.
They have been damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to take them to do it.
We have repristined them and update and updy.
Now they're going to come back to their place underground.
I love the end of the LHC will be to be new integround.
And we want to get it and we expect to get the right or him, and continue so we get so our adventure to find what are the morning morning, what are the morning that universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these are reaccending accidents reaccends the value of science and engineering the value of science and engineering the value of science and engineering.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the words of a scientist, Humphrey Davy, the guy, I guess, I guess, in defense of the experiments of his puzzle, his puzzpill, his puzzle was Michay, said, "No is so dangerous for progress of humans of the mind of the human mind is definitely definitely not new mobile human nears that are definitely not new monekeepers of our triump."
Thank you.
I want to start to ask you to rethink about how children, you play the morning.
As you get to get them to get to get them and grab them, and you can actually learn to think and solve and solve to think and solve problems, and to solve problems and just just think and solving the relationships.
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us.
So, as an informate, the useful of our interaction with physical objects, I started assure, with my Patti, and my Jevan Kalanithi, I started asking -- "And when we use a computer, instead of having the only degree of the mouse of the mouse as a digital polypeline that will move on on a Deceeechers on the sends of the information with enterprising of our hands,
and we system,
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable is a very big computer as a bike.
In a few words, a Siftable is a very big computer as a bike.
You can move with the hand, they can see them move, they can see their movement and have a screen and a screen radio wireless.
But esped, they're physically objects like the morning, they can move it just grab for business.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem for manipulating information digital information.
And as they become safe, you know, you know about the movement, others, and as they become more physics, and as they become safe, conscious of their movement, of how we muod, we can explore new and different kinds of inner interaction.
I'll start with some simple example.
This Sifty is configured to show of the videos -- if you win a direction, the video it will rotate like this, if you stand so that it will stand like this, if you stand from the other hand, you know, if you stand in the other side side side of the background.
These interactive ritional active ratives of others.
If you do that, you care about what they are intorrad.
If they come circums, you see it and they can again a little bit.
If they come circums, you see it and they can again a little bit.
They also have their movement and unlination.
And we have realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the common to the data, to example of a color as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as a green sets and I can use them to sit in the central that in the central that where they mix.
And I can use them to sit in the central that central color and where they mischise to the color to the color in the central color in the central color in the central that way.
If we are too much about it, we can put a little bit of it.
There are also good possibility of learning -- like languages, the mathematics and logic and the logic and the logic things and see the results of the immediately immediately and see the results of the immediately results and the results of the immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonace, which I do with a equations.
Here we have a word of words that is half of Scarabeo and Boggle.
And so of course, to every turns, you get a letter to every Siftle, Pratically, to every turns, you get a letter to go a letter to every Siftable, and as you know, if he control of compose to a dictionary.
And then, after about 30 seconds remisable and you have a new set of reading and new possibilities.
Thank you.
Here's what the children came to the Media Lab, I made them so that they tried them and I wrapped a video video.
They are very much pleased to it.
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of educations.
You just have to say, "To word," and they know exactly what to do.
Here's what other people who try it.
This is our younger better.
It actually wanted to be a lot of mix.
They were just more, for him.
Now, this is a piece of an interactive cardboard cardon.
We wanted to build a tool for learning in the learning of the English leav.
It can be to put new characters in the scene, satives to Siftable their associated with them.
It can be to put new characters in the scene, satives to Siftable their associated with them.
So it's doing the sun.
Video: The only is the sun is surgency.
David Merrill: Now it has brought a treatment in the scene.
Video: The arancient artic.
Bel job.
So if you go to Siftable and put it neighbors --
Video: Bau!
--
Video: Hi, Hi.
DM: It's a story with an open final story with the open final one of them as you know.
DM: It's a story with an open final story with the open final one of them as you know.
Video: Golden gation.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool that I have time to show you recently recently music.
It's a tool instrument, to sample and exeguing music.
Siftable here act sounds like base, base, lower, and bacteria and bactery.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what to use.
You can inform these sounds in a compounds in a compound.
And you just modify it just by doing a sound and a "sequence."
These are actually that you can control of live, like revere, and the filters and filter.
You attackets it to a particular sound and then include it in the staks of it.
And then there are the general effects as time and flight, which is apply to the whole sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to start by putting a basis in two Siftable "sequence."
Now I put a bunch line.
Video: DM: Now I add percent of ussion:
Video: DM: And I'll put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the actual effect of the live.
Video: DM: I can quick the whole sequence by a side or the other.
Video: DM: And now I'll add the filter to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombined the sequence "fle."
So I don't have to plan before, but I can sudden, make it longer or longer a longer or longer a shorter or longer deal.
And now, finally, I can smokly flew the left the Siftable to the left the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interface, more like how we work our brain and more like how our brain works,
And today, I had time to show you one of the results, and also some possibilities that we try to bring out out of the lab of the lab of the lab of the lab of the lab of the lab of the lab of the lab of the laboratory.
The concept I want to transmit is that is getting this new generation of objects designed to interact with digital media in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the hand to talk to all of you.
I'm a writer.
To make books is my profession but it's more than that, of course, of course,
It's also love and the love, the fall of my life.
And I don't expect that can change.
But I said that something particularly happened in my life and my career, who was in my life and my careera, which has brought me to get the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is that I recently recently wrote this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Prega, and so -- which, differently by my books, for some reasons that he became a great sail, sensational.
And the result is that everywhere you go and people treat me as if I got to convice.
It's true -- convicted -- convice,
They come from me to me all concerned and they say, "You don't have to do it for a better than doing better.
You don't have fear to continue to write all the life without you can make a book that could be able to do a book that could matter to somebody?"
that could matter to anyon?"
It's reseassure, you know.
But it could go worse to the worse of the more than 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a training adolescent -- I was a writing.
I would ended up to the same reaction based on the fear.
And people would say, "Don't you get success?
You don't have fear that the humble kill?
You don't have fear to do this mestize all of life without that anything you come out and die of die on a swalk of saming with the mouths of loving ss with the mestic loads of failure?"
So, you know, you know.
The answer -- the short answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is: "Yes."
I am afterwards of all of the things.
I always had land.
And I also have fear of many other things that people may not be to guy.
As you get other things shoulder.
But as I was about the writing what I thought and I was wonderful?
Is it rational?
It's local that anyone must wait for being she'd be she'd be sent to do.
But what is there is so particularly in the premise creative to make us nervous health of the mental health of a way that other people don't do it?
As my father, for example, he was a chemistry engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity that he was asked if he was asked if he fear to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he if he was about it was
It was never -- that block of John, how do it as it does?
It didn't work.
And so so that chemical engineers as a group of uncertainly have not certainly in the secustomers that are being alcolized.
We writers -- we have enough this reputation, and not only writers but creative of all generes, we have this reputation of being enormously instable replied to be enormously instable resonation of mind.
And it's not going to look at the sad of the death of the magnificent deaths of the magnificent of the magnificent century, they die younger and often often for them.
And even those who don't have suicide they look really disappeared by their womans.
Norman Mailer, before of die, in the last interviewed said, "On my book killed me a little bit more extraordinary than the work of life.
But we don't look at the one of the time we hear that because we heard these things so long that we have completely interiorized and accepting the notion that creativity and suffering to the art, and the art, finally, will always be a few ways, and the art, finally, will always be going to get to angosh.
And the question I want to ask all of today, is you agree with this idea?
It is good for you -- because they also look at a distance from a distance to me, it doesn't really good for this supposition.
I think it's odious.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see it perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our big creative minds.
And I certainly know that in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start out to that I was dark to suppositions, especially the circumstances where I'm in my career.
Too -- I think it's pretty young, I am about 40 years.
I have still about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely to write about now and then it will be judged by the world as the work that came after the real succeded after my last book.
I'll be slavery, because we're all more or less friends here -- is likely to my shoulder.
Oh, Gesood, who thinking.
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start bing gin in the nine morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would just just just go to do this work that we do.
So, the question becomes god?
And so I think, after a lot of reflection that the way to continue to write is to create a psychological construct psychological project, OK?
I have to have a few way to find a safety distance between me, which I'm writing about what it is written about what it will write to get from all last year of the pattern of how to do I start looking through time, trying to find other society to see if they could have the best and more health and more health ideas if they could have the best health and healthcare and more health and more health and more health and more health and more healthy and more health and more
how to help people create creative to deal with creative risks of creativity.
And that research took me to the ancient Greek and ancient Rome.
See it because it goes back to the circle and then back back.
In the ancient Greek and ancient Rome -- people didn't look at creat, that creativity came from man, OK?
It thought that creativity was this spirit looks like divine and seven-unt and several unknows, for a distant reasons and unknown and unknown and unknown away.
The Greeks were called these spirits dians of creativity of creativity of creativity called demonies.
Socry, wonderful, I believed to have a demone that would be heaven-hance.
The Romans were the same idea, but they called spirit without a genius of spirit without a genius of the same kind of spirit without a genius of the same kind of spirit without a genie.
which is great, because the Romans didn't think that a genius was really a genius was a particular smart of genius was a very smart of genius was really not really really really really a genius was very smart of genius was very smart of a genius was a very smart of genius to be a little smart of it,
They thought that a genius was this kind of divine entity that was literally in the walls of the study of artist, a little bit like the elfe of artist, a little bit like the elfe of the artist of the artist of the job of that work.
To account -- -- -- that's the distance of what I talk -- that construct psychological that protects from your work.
And they all knew it was so so that it was so that it worked, right?
So the ancient artists were proceed by certain things, like you know, as you know, as you know, too narcissnarcis; right?
If your work was exceptional that you couldn't get all the deployed from this incorporea.
If your work fail, it wasn't all of your work fail, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable to be a very inable,
And so the people han concept of creativity in the Ocker for a lot of time.
Then the Rinconsequence came and everything change, and we put the whole human beings and not leaving the center of the universe on the center of the universe above the universe, and without the space creatures that write details of deves.
This was the principle of the human rational and people started thinking that creativity came completely from the ishsh.
And for the first time in history, it started to referred to this or that artist as a kind of a person who is rather than a person with a genius of the genius to the person.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big mistake --
I think that allowed somebody a simple person to believe that they are as a recipe as a recipe as a recipe as a recipe of all the divinced mysteries of creatives and eths is a responsibility to the fragile of human human human --
It's like to ask somebody to ingoid to ingowever.
It depended on the ego and creates all these ingestiable ingestive for performance.
And I think it's been this pressure that I destroy the artists in the past-year-olds.
And if this is true, and I think the question is, and I think it is, and it becomes there?
Can we do it different?
Maybe you go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery creative mystery
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cell 500 years of thinking about rational thoughts.
And you probably have people in the audience that would save the scientific suspes on the notion of the notion of the notion of the notion of the notion of the projects.
I'm probably not going to convince you all about this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why is it?
Why don't you think about this is what is it?
Because it has more sense of everything that I've ever heard to explain the creative procesasperformance of creative process.
And one process, like everyone who ever ever tried to do something -- therefore, fundamentally, all here -- you don't have rational.
And, in fact, it can sometimes be completely paranormal.
I did this recently with the extraordinary poet Ruth Stone, who has now 90 years, but that was a little poet-year-old, and he said that during his childhood in the rural, and he was working out in the wirginia, he was working out in the country, when a poetry came from the landscape.
He said it was like a fragorous training track.
And that was coming to roll back to her from the landscape.
It was going to get it, because he was doing the land under its feet.
He knew it was to have one thing to do to that point and it was to run up and he was like, "current."
And it reaches to the house and it was following from this poetry, and she would not have to take a piece of paper and a matter, as the trading, as the translate and grab it it on the page.
Sometimes it was not going to be quite quickly, so it was so fast and it was correct and the poem was rooled through and the poem was all the way through and she would continued to roll through the landscape, as he said, "another poet."
Then there were times -- this piece I will never forget -- there were no time -- there were times when it was almost loss that was almost loss -- OK?
So, she was running at home and he was looking for card and the poem was going to go through it, and he was a married in the way that she was going on, and then he was as if he was going to fold with the other hand, and the off.
He was offered the poem of the tail, and he would reveal it on the page.
And in these cases, the poem would be on the perfect page and intacted, but the word, the last word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first thing to the first one of the perfect page of the first word at the first thing to the first one.
So when you hear it thought -- it's crazy, it's just flooking, it's exactly equal to my creative process.
I don't all my creative process, -- I'm not a conducting.
I'm a mulumb, and my way to work is; wake me at the same time every day and go and go over and go over and go over and go over and go over and go over and go over and over the time.
But even I stand in my head and testing on the thing, I was stripped against that thing, and you want.
And I guess many of you have the han done.
You know, even if the work work and ideas came to me from a certain source I couldn't honestly know.
And what is this thing is, is this thing abe?
And how can we relate to us to do not let us get to losing the head, but what do you do to be doing to remain?
As I think about it, the best example of contemporary example that I have is the Tom Waits, which I interviewed a lot of years ago for a newspaper in the newspaper in the newspaper of the day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life was the incarnation of the artist of the account, gestures, to dominate these species of totally interiored species of totally interiored in interiororate of the totally interiorized.
But then he ageed, he would be able to be saving on a cartototoday, in Los Angeles, changed all of him.
It was going to fast and all of a tra-sent this little framework that comes into his head as it does the inspiration, elusive and alethy, and the wish -- and the wish, you know, it's wonderful, and the will, but it doesn't know how to take it.
It doesn't have a piece of card, it doesn't have a math recorder.
So it starts to feel this kind of old anxiety to him, "I'm going to losing it and remarry obsessed with this lost song of this lost song of this performan.
I'm not good and I can't do it."
And instead of going to go to the panic stopped it.
I'll do the whole process of mental and made something completely new.
I'll just look at the sky and said, "Hey, don't see what I'm driving you?"
"You know, it can write a song now?
If you really want to exist, you get to a little bit of opport, when I can take care of you.
Of course I go to care to each other today.
You go to disturbing Leonarary."
And his work process changed after that.
Not the work, the work of it was even dark as a semble,
But the process, and the fishing that was released when the genius was released when the genius came out of him caused to the genius that was going to be in the back of where it was coming from. And he was that not going to be an interior that was a whole thing that was not going to be an interorized.
but he benefit this piculies, wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this external thing that was not Tom.
So how much I felt like to change a little bit the way I was working and already saved a time.
This idea, I save when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Amae and fall of the disperation that we all when we are working on something and we don't start to think that it's going to be a desaster, which is going to be a desaster, which is going to be the worst book that that the worst ever ever writerroy;
Not just bad worst book write.
And I started thinking about throwing this project.
But then I remember Tom who talked about the air and try it.
So I put my face in the hands of the face, and I would say my comments to a corner of the room.
And I said, "Look, what you know, I mean, you know, if this book is not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant, right?
Because as you see I'm going to put all of that I have, I don't have that.
So if you want to be better and do your parts.
Okay. But if you don't do it, you know, I don't do it all.
I'll go to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to favor that I was going to do my talk." Because -- at the end is that I was going to do my talk." So the end of North Africa people were radances of the dances of the dances of the cleaning music -- and the sacred music music sacred that they went to the walk and the heavers of the wavers of the wild of the wide.
And they always were magnificent because the dances were professionals, and they were fantastic.
But every lot of it, and one of these artists became actually transending them.
And I know what I talk, because I know what you have, at a certain point, a loss of it.
It was like the time is stops, and the dance, he walked through a kind of portal and was not doing anything that was a different from the sun, as the 1,000 nights earlier, but all of it was ineaving.
And suddenly it doesn't look like a human human being.
But it turns out of divince and delight-wrap in the fire of divinced in and divinity.
And when this next time, this was the time -- people knew what he was was, they called him his name.
They just had the hands and started to singing, "Allah, Allah, God God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know,
Moreous historick, when the Morean invaser the Spain Spain and the Spaper of Spain, they had this changes in the century of the "Allah, Allah, Allah," you know, "Oh, Of course, you can hear in the ride or in the reef or in the ride or in the famenic.
In Spain, when a artist has done something impossible and magic -- "Allah, magnifi, Go -- and magnificent -- a last one.
And it's great, because we need it.
But the problem comes the next day later, for the ballerin itself, when you wake up and discover that are 11 of the morning, and last of God is not more.
It's just a deaths with a lot of mal in the knees, and maybe it will never be able to get to the stay to the stand at that tune.
And maybe nobody will be going to give God still as yet, and what does it have to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard to be hard.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life.
But perhaps it has no force to be so saving if you can not believe that, you know, the most extraordinary thing of your being come from you to stessive your being being being from you to stessive it.
But I just believe that you have been data in prestered by a imaginable imaginable of this teenage of your life that you have to go and go to somewhere else when you have finished.
And, you know, if we think of this whole change.
And so I started to think about it, and it's because I thought of it as I thought for several months during the work, which I will will be the dangerous one, the dangerous one, the dangerous actical following my great success.
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electrized by this is, not having a land.
Let me just do your work.
It is to show you for your party, any of them to be any of it.
If your work is dance, bally.
If the divine, I assurd, I assigned to let you have some kind of wonderful for a few things for a moment through your effort, then "Oh, y!"
Of course you do the same dance.
And "Oh, you know, you know, you know.
I think I think it's got to teach it.
"You know, even if you know, even for the human beings and testing and testardaggin and testing talks to you to depress all the time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: O!
As you know I've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome, what can mean, and what can mean, and about new genes.
Now we're starting a new performan: we start digitalize biology and now we start to the biology and now starting to a new phase of biology, designing and synthesizing and synthesizing life.
We always tried to ask a big questions.
"What is it life?" is something that many biologists I think they tried to understand a variety of levels.
We tried a different approach, reducing the minims.
We're tyalizing for almost 20 years orities.
When we sequenced the human genome was treating to go from the analogy world of biology to the digital world of the computer.
Now we ask our: can we regenerate life, or create new life from this digital universe from this digital universe from digital universe to the digital universe from this digital universe from this digital universe from this digital universe from this digital universe to digital life from this digital universe from this digital universe to digital life from this digital universe from this
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from genome between those that can carry in the laboratory.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more smaller.
We can eliminate a center of genes of the genes of the two-gene centinaid to the gene of the genes of the two-genes of the two-one centinaid of the genes of the about 500 that are about 500 that are there.
But when we look at the metabolic map of it, is relatively easy to the nostry.
To me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate -- and that's very unlikely that this can bring a living cell.
So we decided that the only way to progression was synthesize this so that we could get the chromosome, so we could make the components to bring some of these questions.
And so we started the adventure of the "Can we synthesize a chromoso?"
Can chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never have been able to create before you gotta do before you?
And in a case of us is we can make a chromoso?
A chromosome, it's just a piece of chemistry of chemistry material.
The speed we can tyalize life is growing up to reach our life is growing to reach exponential.
Our ability to write the genetic code, agee, agee, rather slowly, but it's getting better.
And our most recently resulted the results carry on exponential curve.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of the past review, before we started the first experiments.
But we found that DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that producing little checks of DNA, the long of 30 to 50 beyond and is a degenerative proces: the most segment is longer longer, more selected is longer, more mistake there.
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and reach the mistake of the mistake of the errors.
And this was our first attempt to go from Phi digital information of the Phi Thi X 174.
It's a little virus that kills bacteria.
We designed the fragments, effective reference the reference of the mistake of DNA of about 5,000 lices.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material and we put it in the bacteria started reading this genetic piece and started to read this genetic and to produce the virals.
The viral particles have been release from the cells, they come back and they have destroyed Es.
I talked about recent members of petrolifes were saying that they have certainly comely comfortable this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the biggest things in big,
We wanted to build the entire bacteria of the bacteria of the bacteria --
They're more than 580 thousand thousand and code.
So we thought we build it in the bottom-size virus, so that we can change the components to understand what the components of a living cell.
The design is crucial design, and if we start with digital information into a computer, these must be very accurate computers, these must be very accurate computers, these must be very accurate computers, these must be very accurate computers, these must be very accurate computers, these must be very accurate is crucial design, and if we start with digital
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the standard accurately was of a mistake for every 10 thousand mile for every 10 thousand mile --
We found that we have resequencing that original sequence -- 30 errors. If we had we used that original sequence we would never be able to work.
A part of the process is to design segments that are overwhelming with all the other segments of 50 beings to build smaller subunit to build smallest tounity to build these little little little bit more segments in together.
Let's try to be one of the job elements here.
You probably have a little bit of you can see the bilize.
Think of it is: we have a genetic code.
Three of those readers together so much about 20 administrate administrate about 20 administration for every amin-to-acid.
So we can use the genetic code.
What we did we do at the beginning was self-to do it.
Some of them have been dolphin that it was not a poetry.
We designed these sat to just job them with a fundamental to uniform with a fundamental one.
There are enzymes that repair and put them with them.
And we started to assembling from six, and starting with segments from five to seven miletter to 24 mile lyming to 24 thousand mile that when to get to 72 miletter to get to 72 letter letter to 72 letter to 72 letter letter.
And we have produced these checks in abundance in so that we are trying to create a very robate proception of that we are trying to create a very robute -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So this looks like the tabellon a basket.
When we get to these very long, more than 100 mile maker, more than 100 mile would not be going to be directly in E.
You get to the modern limits of molecular biology --
So we looked at other mechannels.
We knew another mechanism called a wisdom called homology, which is useful to repair the DNA that we can uniform the DNA to unique to repair the DNA to unique the chance.
Here's an example.
This organism is called Deinococcus radioduce -- can absorb up three million rad radiation.
You can see in the sound squared like his chromosome, it is destroyed.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly how it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that have been able to do it.
These organisms can be touch completely.
They can live under empty.
I'm absolutely sure life existing in space, and you get to find new rich environments.
In fact, NASA showed that this happens.
This is a picture of the molecules that we built using these processes -- just using the lighting with the design of the chunks of inserious design.
The liver, I listening to the automatically.
This picture was not taken with a electronic microscope but with a regular microscope that we had a regular microscope that
It's a molecule so big that we can see it with a slightly slightly read it.
These are pictures that they cover a period of six seconds.
This is the publishing that we have done a little time ago.
They're more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of a definitely ever created by the man.
It's got a 300 million million.
If we go with a 10 paper caratter without space, you would like 142 pages to get this genetic code.
Now, how do we do it work? How do we active it?
Obviously, you get a virus is a game by kids.
It's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria as they use bacters.
It's simpler than when it's eukarioes like ourselves ours, you can just extract the nucleus and put another one of it, which is basically the process of cloning.
In the bacteria archaaea is integrated inside the cell but we recently showed that we can make a complete train of a chromosome, and we recently showed it to another and active to another and active to another and active to another and active to the chromosome,
We clean a partner with a partner with a microbial species.
The two are different as men from topis.
We added a few genes in a way that we can decide what to choose for this chromost.
It then hit with the enzymes so that they can kill all proteins.
And when we put it in the cell was stupending -- and you open our graphy dest of the graphicatos -- the new chromosome, she went into the cell.
And we started to go to the three, but we tried to get it over there.
This is one of the major mechannels of evolution.
We found that a lot of species, they added a second or a third chromosome, adding in a second thousand new tracks to the species.
So who think about evolution as a gene gene to evolution that you don't understand the biologists of biology.
There are enzymes called restripes of restriction is that adrights the DNA.
The chromosome, it was not able to have one.
The cell pha-the cell that we have inserito--take.
It has been expressed, and it recognized the other way as a summer material, has been retreatment, and we have a rently retreatment with just the cell and the new chromosome.
It became blue because of the genes that we have insert.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a species are going, and you moved all in a new species, based on a new software that we put in the new software that we put in the mobile phone to the new software that we put in the mobile phone of the software that we put in the mobile phone.
All the proteins have changed -- member have changed and when we read the genetic code.
Now, this may look like genetic alchemy, but by the software DNA can change things in a pretty replace.
Now, I explained that there is not about genesis -- but progress to start by three million and a half million evolution and a half of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion process.
Why do I do that?
I think it's obvious enough when we think of our need to our need to us.
We're going to go from six billion people to nine in the next 40 years.
Just to give you an example: I am born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existent in 1946; 40 years, there will be a four-year-old.
We're going to find out the problems now to find fresh and cleaner, medicine for six and a half billion people.
It will be even harder to do it for nine billion.
We use more than five billion carbon dioxide than 30 billion barrels of boil.
That means a million barrels a day.
When we try to find biological processes of biological processes of them, you will be a huge challenge of it.
We have to have to be more to get the whole amount of CO2 from these materials that ends up in the atmosphere.
And the day of today, because of the scientific discoveries that all over the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the components for the future.
The electronic industry is only a dozen about components, and think about how many different things have come to smoke.
Our limits here are principles of biological reality, and our imagination.
Now we have some techniques to these superthetic rapid synthesization, can create what we call combinative genomics combinative genomics
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day.
Think of processing these 20 million genes of different genes or try to optimize the processes to produce either either vaccines, we can change, because of a little team, and molecular biology now now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard selection section.
We can choose for survive, chemistry or carbon dioxide or of vaccines.
This is a few software programs of some software programs that we're working to be able to sit and designing species to the computer.
Well, we don't need to know how they will be there.
We know exactly what their genetic code.
Now we are now focusing on fourth generation.
You also saw you see that you can extract from grand it was a bad experiment.
We have carbon on on second and third generation that will be used enough to the higher sugar sugar, as the optie or different kinds of thrown --
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increasing impact without increasing impact without increasing the cost of food and limiting the dig CO2 in material, to which we are working for designing cells that can achieve this purpose -- and we are going to be able to get this purpose of the fourth generation in about 18 months.
The combined light combined with CO2 is a methodo; we found in all over the world, we found different methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep ocean -- about 2,500 feet temperature of the water.
It creates metane from CO2 molecular hydrogen molecular as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can get the CO2, which can easily be transported by your CO2 in carbon to drive that CO2 in carbon to drive this process.
So let's think about the petrochemicals we might be able to increase what the question of what the life" is the Noen, true goal -- we have the modest of replacing the whole petrochemical.
Orly. If you can't do it from TED, where do you can?
It would be a main of energy.
And we are working to use the same methods to create the same methods to create the instantanea.
You have seen this year with the influence, we always go back of a year and with a dollar bunch of the right vaccine.
I think what you can change by combining advaccines in anticide anticipy.
Here's how the future could start to look like change, now, the tree of evolution, accelerating evolution with bacteria -- and finally accelerating the eucarian cells --
We're so much so that you can get people.
Our purpose is to make enough to try to get it to get a lot of trying to make it. Thank you very much.
And I will show you all of you will see the fastest possible possible -- some fundamental work that we took the Microsoft to a watch water, a nearly year a very exactly. That's Seadragon.
It's a environmental where you can interact with is a local level.
Here we are seeing a lot of gigabyte of digital photos, with a kind of a continue, for a very quickly speed, and I have the images of the images as we want.
And it doesn't matter how much much much the amount of information that we see we see, how big these data collects of data or imagines.
Most of them are digital photographs, but this is a provide from the Library of Congress, and rewing into the legal legal of Congress, and rewing in the legal legal of the Congress,
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that it limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in all time. It's also a very flexible architecture in whatever you can see.
This is a whole example of data, not imagined data.
This is the Dickens. Every coonna represents a capitule.
To show you that it's just about testing and not imagines, we can do something like this, to see really that it's a real representation of the head, not of a photo.
It could be a little artificial way to read a electronic book electronic book.
You don't advil.
This is a more realistic. It's a number of "The Guardian Dardian ham.
Every picture is the beginning of a selection.
And it really gives you the pleasant experience of reading the paper version of a magazine version of a magazine of a fifth of a fix, which is for nature of a lot of kind of meeting.
We also did something with the corner of this number in the wild of the Guardian an.
We created a fasulla advertising advertising -- much more than you use in a normal commercial publicity: and we inserted content ent content ent content ent contained content ent content of extra.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specifics.
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to helimining the limits of space on the screen.
And we hope that this gentlemployers and other porches, you don't have to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if we don't say we have contributed to do that field to be given in this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. sovation above a geost imagined of NASA.
So now we move to something else.
This is now now now is actually from the webs; you can see it here.
It's a project called Photosynth, which fights two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer that was a very interesting visual computer that was a student of Washington, with Steve Seitz Uph of the UWashington, with the aid of Microsoft Research. A opop, opopping this optimal --
And it's living on the web, and it was managed by Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen, where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience of the multiple resolution of the multiply.
But the space collotion of the images here has actually a meaning.
The visualization of computer visualization have recorded these images together, so that they reach to the real places, so that you can imagine -- all the way the real. And so that you can see the elements of the Grassious Mountained -- have been taken here. So here you see some of elements of a slidedede-stable slide-stable level -- these things have been connected to space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more space.
I want to go directly to one of the notion set of Noahan data, and this comes from a previous protope of Photosynthosynths that we have done for the first time last summer -- to show you what I think is really the chieved glass the environments of the technologies that we have been doing this technology, Photosyth.
We had to worry about what I was reading and forth forth.
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images Flickr. Basta digital reconstruction from Flickr. Bast, and you get images of the camps, and you get images of the camps, and the camps, and the saying. Each of these around.
So they're all images from Flickr and have been all related to space, in this way.
And you can have to be navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never think of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratify to get this kind of a lovelary here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of framework from those of the cell professional -- the ones of the SLR, a meaningful number of things in this environment.
And if I can do that, you try to look for those oldest things.
Many are blocked blocks, etc.
Some part of here is a series of photographs -- there it is.
This is a poster of Notre Dame record.
We can go from the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now taking data from everyday -- from collective interviewing as the earth-view memory of how to the earth, from the view, from the view, from the view, from the point of view -- and connecting all of the data from the data point of view, from the collective --
All those photos are getting connected together, more than the sustains of the sum of the parts.
You have a model of the entire emergence.
Think about this as a promotion of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual Tupon the Earth virtual virtual Earth
It's something that grows in complexity as people are using, and the which is advantages to help him with use.
Their photos are marked with metaders from other people.
If you get the idea of contrast to all these sets saying, my picture of Notrecial cattedral. And I can use it as a provide of all of those data, and I can use it as a kind of sent point of all of the data, in the space, in that metaphor to the space, in the space, and have a sense of the red of the type of red type of red-type from from the sets of a red kind of re-mote of the type of re-shelter --
Of course, a consequence of all of this is very high-way modeled virtual processed of any interesting of the earth of the earth of the earplan, and satellite images and satellite images and satellite memory, but from collective memory.
Mille thank you.
CA: I got to get it to do is that your software will tell us to do is that at a certain point, in the next few years, all the photographs of the next few years of all the photographs of shared in the world or will be connected to anyone in the world will be connected together?
BA: Yes. What is doing is doing is actually discover it.
It's creating hyperlink, if you want to be empty -- between images.
And it's doing it in the bottom of imagines.
And it becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of the semantic information that many of these images are going to be able to do that many of these images are going to be very interesting if you think about the wealth of these images are going to be very interesting if you think about the wealth of these images are that you think about the wealth of the richness of the richness of the wealth
As you do a research of images on the Web, you know, a phrase and the page on the Web page of pictures of photos.
Now, what if that picture is going to connect all your picture?
So the amount of semant interconnection of the semant interconnection is really enormous about it is really enormous of it. It's a classical effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the pleasant pleasant when you travel and one of the delight-to-inner research is the way to live in who didn't forget the old of the old in the wind, the stony in the wind, the stone in the wind, the today, the today, the today, the today, the today, the fears in the windulty of plants.
You think that the monkers still travel the Meky Lattea, or that the same time the Milky Lattea, or that the elder, the budying are still in Himalaya, the buddistances are still going to recall the constrote of the Dharm of the Dharm of the Dharm of the Dharm of the South Wake is not in the sense of reality, but it's just a model of reality, and the idea of reality,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptative adaptations that our stirps has done, good or mal, many generations ago.
And, of course, we all share of the essential tracts.
We all hidden we all procreate.
We're subjects to get rewards of staration.
We need to deal with deaths of death, so we don't surprising and balance,
We all have a art of them.
What it is the particulars of canod, the rhythm of all culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Penan forests of Borneo, or the followers of Haiti, or Haiti, or the warriers of the desert of Kenya Septhonal Curanderries, Curanderries, or a cameline in the heart of Saa.
He was my companies of traveling in the desert a month ago, or a waller of the Walls of Mounder Moundly Mount Mount Mount of Everest, the mother of the world.
All of these populations teaches us that there are other ways of thinking about, other ways of thinking about, other ways of moving in the world.
And if you reflect, it's a concept that can give you hope.
Inside, the cultures of the world creating a spiritual of the world creating a spiritual and cultural life that goes and the planet and is important for the benefit of the planet as a biosphere.
And you can think about this raise as a ethnoxiety and you can define the ethnoxietnoxic sum of all the concepts, mitting of all the concepts, mythications that are being from the alba of conscious human imagination from the the alba of consciousness of consciousness.
Eetnospher's fantastic pathriage of humanity.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be as as as as as a kind of quisities.
And because biosphere was very much as it was very much as it was as much as it was so much fast.
No biologist, for example, it would say that 50 percent of all the species is or the east of the summtion of the summer -- in the ultimate ipots -- in the field of biological diversity -- and you don't even near the most optimistic of the most optimistic diversity.
The indicates all of this is, of course, the language of languages.
When you're born 6,000 languages on this planet.
A language is not only composite by a vocabulary or a series of gramatical.
A language is the pray of human spirit spirit of human spirit.
It's the half of the animation of all culture, comes in the material.
Every language is a forest of mind, a sustain, a spiritual ecosystem.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we are sitting here in Monterey, at least half of the time is not getting sweet in the ears of children.
They don't come to the children, which means less than you get anything, which is not something that they have died.
What is it more sad than being the sad of being the last talk of the last talk to a language, of not having a way of transmit to transmit the promise of the shift of kids?
This is a bit of a few weeks of the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks a laughter and door and door and door and door and door and door and a language --
And I know that somebody will say, "Is it not better?
The world would not be a better place if we talk, all the same languages?"
Let's talk about it.
You will find a tract of a tract thing that means you can't talk about their language.
I would like to do a journey through etnosfera's ethnosfer,
a little journey in the ethnospher's abrices of what we're perdening.
Many of us forget that when I say, "different ways of existing exists, I mean different ways of exists.
Let's take for example, this Barasana, in Amazony, Amazony, the popular of anacony, which creates the people of anacony, which creates the mit of the east of the lended serpants of sacris.
It's a popular that it is not able to distinguish the color of the green color, because the time it is identified in the forest time of the forest, which depends the population.
They have a strange language and a marriage rule, said, "exogamics -- you have to marry a different language.
And all of that has roots in the mitological past, alone is that in these extese families that you talk about six or seven lings, because of the marriage of the mystery of the mystery of a language.
They just just listen to and then start talk.
Let's take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived -- Waorans of Ecuador nords, an incredible popular Ecuador -- and incredible popular that has the first contatts in 1958.
In 1957 mission have tried to commission of a face.
They have made it from the pictures that they would get them into a few that they would get them to deal with friendly dimenticing that this people of pluvial forest that they had never seen billultimate bi-dimensional bi-dimensional bi-dimensional foreign foreign for.
They collected the picture of the plan, they have been looking for a form or a shape or a figur, not finding anything, they have concloud, and they killed the five mission with the lances.
But the Waorans don't kill they have to do the straniers.
They killed between them.
54 percent of the death was caused by themselves.
We are risked to eight generations and we found two natural death cases and when we put it for saper, they have admitted to be so that they died again that she died again -- and then they killed him himself.
The hunters were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the first 1980s, I was assigned a really interesting job when my professor of Harvard was asked if I wanted to go to Haiti to encourage to Haiti to ensure that I was going to Haiti and Tonton Macoutes, and the Tonton Macoutes, and imposing the velended up with the velended up with the velened to use the velencoues, and I was going to Haiti to go to Haiti to encoutes, and I use to get to get to get to get to
To make sense of the myracology, I would have to understand Voodoo culture.
It's pretty a complete complete vision of the world.
Very interesting interesting --
If you ask to tell me the big religions of the world, what would I say to do about it?
Christianity, Islam, Ebraism, Ebrism, etc.
A continent is always leaving out sub-Saharan Africa has no religious. And instead of the Voodoo and Voodoo is not the distilled of these very profound religious concepts, very profound religious concepts, in the tragics of the savisms.
What makes voodoo interesting is that it is the intriguing between life and death.
So you live in the spirits.
The spirits can be invocated by Grande Aqua, respond to the dance of dance and they replaced temporary s' walk so that for a brief active to the life that for a brief active to the deal.
So this is the voodooisters like to say, "You know, white to talk about God.
We give us in the time and we become God."
And from the moment that you are possing, is the spirit that you drive you, as you can do you?
So you see these incredible events -- you followed your voodor in the state of training tiles that touch are unfairly infugee papers of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind when they catalyzed in a state of summer extreme in a state of summer of it.
And in all the populations that I lived the most extraordinary of Sierra Nevada Santa Marcky Santa Marcil Santa Marckey in the Colombia secentrional of the most extraordinary in the Colombia of secentrional and the most extraordinary of the people with the extraordinary in in the Colombia.
It was the prehenable givests that once they live on the careers of Colombia in the conquist, the population of the conquist, the population of the volcanic massive that is the volcanic massive --
In a continent continge, this popular continent -- this popular has never been conquised by the shagrees.
And yet they are governed by a claim but their trained is really extraordinary.
The young followers are taken by the family, and they live in a secret world in a world that they live in a world that we have a shake of the ice for 18 years.
Two period of nine years of proposited to reproduce the nine months of gestion deal with the user of the mother, are now metaphor of the user of the use, and the Madre.
For all of this time, they get accultured to their society, values that they prehended their prayers and only their prayers and only their prayers -- or to say the cosmic balance.
At the end of this incredible beginning, they are suddenly bed out and for the first time in life, they see an alba. And in that active of consciousness of the first bag, when the sun of the beautiful landscape, all of that they learned in theory comes all his splend. The prevent is all his splend. The prey is a past of the theory of the speaker. The prey is a and say,
"You know, I just said to you.
It's amazing. Now it's going to protect it."
They call them a major brothers and say we are the colpeful brothers of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think of Indian populations and we invote in Rousseau and the old story of the noble of the wild of the noble -- which is a remarkable concept of the Earth of us.
The indigenous people are not feeling ners from our dayside.
There's not space for these things in the malaric stages of Tibet, or in the geliths of Tibet, but because of the time and ritures created a mystic of Earth is not about the concept of being conscious conscious conscious intuition, the most substanti-consciousness -- the concept that the Earth can only be because it's unbelieved by human consciousness --
What does that mean?
It means that a guy in the Ande of the Ande that is creating that the mountain is a spirit of Apu is to be a human being being being deeply and will have a good relationship with the mountain or that place in the Montana who was a lot of different mountain or that place in the Montana who grow is a mountain is a massive mountain is that a massive mountain is being a mountain of the mountain of the Montana mountain or that a which which is going to be be being being a a mountain of the mountain of a mounded with a mo
which is the dimore, or a little bit of a little bit of a mineral cate core cut is irrelevant.
What is interesting is is the metaphor that define is the relationship between individual and the natural world.
I grew up in the forests of the Britain, creating the forests of the forest and they had to be cut to be cut to be cut.
And that has reded me a different human beings from my friends Kwakiut, who believe that the forests are dimora diadia's dia's diac and the spirits spirits that live in the wild we face to the north of the world, the spirits that they face during the Hamatsa.
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually create different, and you can start to understand some sense of their own sense of feelings.
I took this picture of the beeen in the nordoctorking.
Maybe some of you have heard about ayahuas, the most powerful replacement, the most powerful repertoo.
What makes it fascinating the ayahuass is not the potential to be able potential of the support -- but his elaboration. It's made by two elements.
And as a hand, this legal legacy that has a series of carboline, harmine and harmine and molans, and harminds;
And by taking the only plant plant, you have a fire that alters a little bit of the consciousness, but it's chosen with the leaves of a coffee family, and he was choices to live in a viridis.
This plant, this plant, powerful is very similar to serotonine, a methoxyltryptamine-5, methoxyltryptamines.
If you ever see the Yanomami tiring on the hidden replaced that they do from a different set of species, anches of methoxydimethoxydimethoxydimethoxydimethoxydimethoxydimethod.
Tiring that pole is a little bit like being dissolution from a fire of a dipink of the boards and land on a sign of electricity. Risthe] It doesn't believe a distortion of reality.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who dropped the psychchopen, with his discovery, with his discovery, with his discovery, hallucinogens in the 1930s in Mexico.
And so I think I can't want to be classify these triaminogist because if you're doing you are not telling anyone to be hallucind. But I will triptamine along. I'm not going to be hongerious because they're denaturated by a enzymmblindgen enzyme that is of the intrigued monoxidayses.
You can listen to them that is just if you put it with other chemicals that denial replaces MAO.
Now is the beauty betan undarian that they are in this book, are inbangers of MAO, the same kind of need to potentiate triptamines. The question is available to a flour of plants, how these people are going to find two deaths of plants, how these people are not a similar to the way, but if you combine in this way, they think if you combine in this way, they believe the dangers?

But if we ask Indians, they will tell us "Plants talks about it."
What does that mean?
This tribe, the Cofan, has 17 variety of ahuas, distinguish, and that distinguished in the forest, and that our eyes would come into the same species.
If we ask him how do they stabilize their rate rate race and they will tell us about plants, of the rest I don't know everyone to meet it --
The solution is: You take 17 variety in a night of the pill, and each one will be a different way.
You don't have a Harvard, but it's much more interesting than content to content the stams.
Now, [applausi] the problem is that we have to give you the people people who have to give them a painting them in the history of the history of the history of the history of our real world, and pass to the marges of the history of the history of our real world, and past it three.
In fact, the X-century, 300 years, it will not reminded to remind or its wars or its technological innovations that but rather how the thing is where we stopped and we have about, and we have employees in the destruction of biological diversity and cultural the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All cultures through the century have been involved in a dance for new possibilities.
And the problem is not technology.
The Sioux Indians have not to be soux when they put from ark, and fresh as the fresh and fresh as the Americans have not stop being Americans when they put from the horse and calyxiety and cities.
It's not the change or technology that threats the integrity of ethnosfer. It's the power.
The domination fly of domination.
And if you give a look at the world, you will find that these are not destined cultures.
They are living and dynamics and push and dynamics out of existence that will go beyond their ability to adaptation.
And I'm going to be disboxes in the pathric of Penans,
a no-made Sarawak, in the East aside, a popular popular that has lived in the forest, to a generation -- and now reduced to a generation -- and now reduced the river, where you can see the river, the river, which looks like the river, which looks like the fivered by the Cinese Meridional, where the Japanese Meria, where the Japanese is the Japanese lim of the Japanume that the Meria,
It ready to return the staks with the wooden wood of the forest.
Or in the case of Yanomami, are the disease that have come with the discovery of the golden of the golden golden of the golden of the time.
If we move on on the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research, where I'm doing a lot of research, you see the hardwrap of the political domination.
As you know the genocide -- the physical extreme of a popular popular level, but the destruction of a universal, but the destruction of a popular popular style, not just convicted -- but celebrated in certain environments, because it is part of the strategic strategic strategic of development.
And you can't understand the suffering of Tibet until you start to the beginning.
I have the 6,000 miles from China in China in China through the West through Tibet southetheast with a young line, and you get to Lhasa young line, but only arrived in Lhasa and I realized what there's the statistics we feel about the statistics we feel about about it.
6,000 monuments in the polygen and cenergy.
1.2 million people killed by military during the Cultural.
The father of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama.
which means that it was killed in the time of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion --
Her is was fighting with Santity during the diaspora that has brought the popular that has brought the population in Nepal.
Her mother was imprisoned and his guilk was to be real.
It was brought to hold the age of two years from the hand, you know, he could not live without him.
The sister that made the same, it was in reedual field.
A day he was inherent a fashion cooler Mao or the Mao and, for this transgression, was forced to work for seven years.
Tio pain of Tibet can be inable, but the spirit of the popular is from tenners to be present.
At the end, all of it is reduces to a choices.
We want to live in the world of the monothony of the monoths of the diversity world of diversity of diversity?
The big ancropologist Margaret Mead, before we die said that his biggest fear was that in our loving this view of the world, not just to see the legal legal of human imagination reduced a concerned modality of thought, but a day we wake up to a dimentict of mindnone dimenticing from a dimentict of the way that they were possibilities.
And it's humble to remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neoliter's revolution that has given us agriculture, which has done us to be fight to the delilight-delivered the poem of the classrow of the specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern world industrialized in the same way for 300 years.
That sharks to me that we have the answers to all the challenge that we have to deal with the challenge that we have to deal with the millennia.
When these cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human, they respond to be, respond to 10,000 of them.
And it's in these answers that we all have risk to be what we are. We are all the popular possibility that has to make it so that all the populations and all the people and all the gardens can trust, and all the people can fold to the gain.
I took this picture of the north of Baffin, when I went to the wild island with Inuit and this man, Olaya, and this man, Olaya, he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather.
The dog government was not always gentlemen with the Inuit and in the '50s to our premaintain our earlier -- we have reinhink in colonies.
The grandfather of this man refused to go there.
The family, tempting for his life, he took all the arms, and all of his attemps.
You need to know that Inuit doesn't temme the cold hurta.

One of you know, a nation-state example of how a nation-state can reconcive with his people.
And, finally, I think it's pretty obvious at least who we had been in these remote areas of the planet, and realizing that they don't have any remote of it.

where the wisdom of all the population can contribute to our collective benefits of being collective benefit.
Thank you.
I'll talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope I call other that you already heard and try to revive some links in the case not notaste.
I want to start with what I call "the official dog."
The dog's office?
The official dog's officer of all the West dog's officer office: "If we want to be to be like the benefit."
The reason for the stand, in fact that freedom is in itself a value, is useful, useful, useful, useful for human beings.
On the other one is that if we are free, everyone can act to do everything that massive to do everything that mass our benefit of it, not not who deciding to our benefit from our lot.
The way to masses is to be wealthy is to be massize.
More choices people are going to hand, more than the freedom, more than they are freedom, more than they are the freedom.
This is a remarkable reception, in society that nobody would dream to put it in doubt it in doubt.
And it's also deeply radicated in our lives.
I'll show you some examples of what progress has requireed possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big.
I lost a simple note on conditions for insales.
In my supermarket is 175 conditions, without content the 10 variety of extracting olive and 12 sets of the Sunitysamic whales that you can buy you for a huge number of confident of constance that no one of your 175 ready already is of your degradiency of your degrades.
Here's what the supermarket.
Then you go to the electronic store, to buy one stere: CD, radio, CD, radio, radio, plast, radio, plast, leg.
And in this single single store, there's a big number of electronic components.
We can do six million and a half of different combinations using the components that there are in one negoties.
You need to admit that there is a lot of choices.
Some of the trucks world of communications.
One time, when I was a child, they could get all the services, to get all the services, to be a lot of phones, to the pat Bell.
He was known the phone, you didn't buy it.
A consequence of that, in the way, was that the phone is that the phone is not a making.
These times, I went to it.
We have a variety of telephone, especially between the cell phone, especially between the cell phone,
Here's the phones of the future.
My favorite is the one in the middle, reader, MP3, cut of the hidden crymeline for the crym of the crym of the crym of the hidden crying.
If you don't have seen it in the store under the case, you're very well certain that will prestake to come down.
And what happens is that people in the stores of the people come in the stores and do this question and say, "No."
You can't buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water, you can do the same explosion of choices.
Law -- health is: It doesn't happen in the United States that you go from the doctors and the doctors you have to do.
Instead, you know, you go to the doctor, and the doctor, B" "Teches and these answers and these answers to the risk "B" has these skills and these risks are you going to do that?"
You say, "Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Doctor, what should I do to do to do?"
And the doctor says, "A has these benefits and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you rebit, "Dr. if she was me, what do you do to do that?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not leight."
The result we call it ""mala," expression that makes it look like a good thing.
But it is actually not that one to move the fish and responsibility of decisions from somebody knowing somebody, or somewhere else knows -- and almost certainly it's not -- and almost certainly is sick -- and so not in conditional conditionth to make the obvious decisions the which.
There's a huge marketing of drug products, and you know, if you think about it doesn't make any sense, because you think of it doesn't make any sense, because we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, why do they have it to buy them --
The answer is that they want to do that doctor we call the doctor to ask ourselves to change the reception.
And what about so fundamental as is our identity is a question of choice, as you see in this journal -- we don't want to be, to be not to get the children. They don't want to get the children.
And we can reinvention us how many times us we get aggrade.
which means that every morning -- and you have to decide that kind of person to be.
And I had to the family, and the marriage of time perspective -- and it was that he was that he was married us as much as the most prestery as soon as we were going to be able as much as possible.
The only real choices was with when, not when they don't even even what to do later.
Today, it's really really to play it.
I think of very smart students, and I do do their 20 percent of work than a time.
And because they are not dbrilliant, because they are not less diligs.
But why are they impencils, I mean, do I should marry or not, "Do I should make it now?"
"Do I have to marry a later? I think before the children or career?"
I'm a logiatives of logic logis.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implement doesn't completing the companies that you ask, and not get a good vote to my exame.
And they have to do that. They are important questions.
Now, the job: we're lucky, like Carl underlymer -- because technology allowed us to work every single day, from the Hotel Randolel Randolel Randolel Randolel Randolel Randolel Randolel Randolel Randolineavph.
And in the parents, there's a corner, and I'm not going to tell anyone and where the WiFi works.
I don't say that because I want to use it.
What means, this incredible freedom of choices that we have about work? It's that we have to continuously decided, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son play, with the cell phone in a pocke, Blackberry in the wild wild wild cross-knee.
And even if they're all sheep, every minute we see our son rovince and we also ask the game -- I said, "Do you know, do you call it a thing?"
"Do you answer this go? I have to abboy?"
And even when the answer is "no," all of this makes the experience of your game, very different than what would be going to be in other conditions.
So, we can be all we look at it, small and big, things and style and stiles of life, life is a question of choices.
Ovo, once the world was this: Ovo, there were some possibilities, but it was not a question of choices.
The world of today, the world is like this: The dilemma is, "Is it positives, or negative thing?"
The answer is St.
The positive we know all of them, so I'll talk about the negative ones that we all talk about negative things.
All this is two negative effects two negatives on people.
The first one, paradoxicype, is that produces instead of freation.
With many options between the ones that choices, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I give you a meaningful example -- a conducted study of volunteer pensions.
A connect of my connection data, gigant, the gigant, the gigant, gigant, with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are being offered in more, the percentage of adescene -- 24 percent.
With 50 sources, there's 10 percent of offeres, there's 10 percent of the decasionate when they have been available only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources in which they chooseen, it's very difficult decided, and choices is remaintain the questions.
And to question, and I wonder questions, and of course and of course it doesn't come there.
You know, you know that not just means that these work from old people to eat the dog because they will not have enough money, want to say that decision is so obsticle fundamental fundamental fundamentary data.
Not participation, they're losing until 5,000 dollars from the data, to be good for the data, which would be good to sive.
So paralysis is a consequence of having too much choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And to end up for ethice: ketchup, senape or main?"
You know, you want to make the right decision if it's eternity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong source, and you don't have the wrong condition to the wrong condition
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can avoid paralyside, and make a choice, we are least undmidden of how we would have been with less options between which you choose to what to choose to them.
And this for several reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions of what you choose and you buy one and not perfect it, it's easy to imagine you might have to do a different choices that would be better than the alternative imagined us to be better than the imagined and remultimately remultimately the decision of choice, and remundaries the remunddisphanted by the decision of the decision --
even when it was a good decision.
More choices us are easy to detail anyone details that is unbelieved in option of choices.
And also there's what economists call it cost-opportunity.
DGilbert has a very well stamattine as the value we give things to the things depends on what we confrontier.
And I mean, when there are so many options possible is so easy to represent the alternate features of the alternate of the option of option of opposite option of opposing option is choices.
Here's an example. I have been going to be the ones that are not in New York.
But that's what you probably thought about it.
There's this copy to Hamptons.
A place of the slow of the sluxury.
Spipes splendid. It's all about it.
It doesn't send anything.
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are alive."
"I could talk about your home."
And it goes two weeks that we were being losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where you want.
The expensive opportunity is decreeness for what we have, even when the choice was reporting for what we have, even when the choices was very exciting.
And the more are options that we have to look at it, more the features are going to come back against opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
It is about the living moment, and maybe of the living beyond slow.
But the most important point is that everything you choice, you get to do not to do the others.
The things that we don't choose to do that they can make less attacts of what we do.
Third point: the spiral growing of expectancy.
I tried it on my skin skin a new jeans.
And I will be nearly always to jeans.
And once the jeans were just a guy, you buy them and dress and west -- they were southwest, only after you have them to be good and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work a lot of times, they were being being being sought and wested a lot of times, they were swesting and they were swested with a lot of times, they were just just after you were to go to good.
So I went to buy a couple of jewels, and I said, "I'm going to need a couple of jeans, this is my cut cut."
The committed, "You want to slim fit, fit easy fit, fit and do it and do it --
You want to do the cernier or with the bottonies? "Stonehed" or "acid" or "acid" or "?
"Do you want to be a lot of it as a lot of it
"Would you want to get a stret? Ble blake -- they would receive them.
I was smart, and after a little bit of I could say, "I want the guy -- that was the only one guy -- that was the only one guy had no idea what I was so for a while, I tried to all of them ever because, and I came out of the negoti, with the best of the negotia, with the best jeans I had ever had had had had I had had to have it.
It was the massive one. With all that choices I had the best.
But I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason why I was worse to the worst is that with all that choices my expectations were just going to be perfect.
At the beginning I was waitative minimes. I didn't expect when there was only one guy, but when I saw 100 different 100 different guys -- at least one guess was going to be perfect.
What I had watched was good -- but not perfect it.
After I had paragoned to what I tried to try and insound in confronted.
The addition of the options of people don't do that increase the expectations that these have respect cells of options in the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the people do not to increase the expectations that these are respectacular cells.
And this will be less reliable to do less soddisfation, even when the results are results.
No one in the world of marketing if it makes it.
Because if you know what I'm talking about.
The truty looks more like this.
"It was better when he was worse when he was worse when he was worse about when he was worse to the worst was that when he was worse to meet the pleasant was still to meet of pleasant please.
On the world we live -- opulent industrialized citizens with the perfeed of perfordness -- the most people who can hope is that things are at the expectation of expectations of it.
You will never surprised because your expectations because your expectations and expectations and my expectations and they have it.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is "Baswaitt." "Yes, you want."
I want to say -- little moment -- which are really married -- which are really married and my wife is really stupendy.
I couldn't make better, I didn't make a better meet, I don't have to do a better mechannel.
But you know, it's not always a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of buying a couple of jeans sweet when you are only like jeans is that when you're not satisfacted, and you ask you "Why?"
"Who's responsible, the answer is clear.
The world is responsible. What do I do to do with us?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy one insoddisfacent, and you ask you is responsible for you, is the responsible is as a responsible for you are you.
You could make better.
With hundreds of variety of available variety of available --
So when people do decisions, even if the result is valive, they feel unbelieved and they do it and give colping the same.
In the last few years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world,
I think that a meaning factor, but important -- not the only one of this hondiod: the hondepression is too much alone.
And when they need to explain this situation they think that the hit is it.
So the final result is that we are going to general, objectively, but we feel worse.
Let me tell you about it.
This is the official dog, what we all do for good and it's completely fail.
There is no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than that doesn't have any long, but it doesn't have a lot of choices is better than a little bit.
There's a critical value value of it.
But I'm sure we have overcome from a piece of the piece that choices improve our life.
Now, from political point -- I have almost finished -- from policy, the nock of policy, the nock is the following.
What it allows all this is the material society is the material.
There are a lot of places in the world, and you know about it, where the problem is not that they have too much choices.
The problem is that they have too much a few of it.
So the factory of which I'm talking about is a malasive of moderns, rich societies.
And what does is doing and we can get to angry is this: Steve Levitt talked about how much those consticks and sweateling seats are useful.
I want to say that these choices, complicated and dispended on it, it's not just inutious.
I'm just deleterious to be deleteries.
They do worse in the worst of it.
If a little bit of what in our societies society was reverse to those where people have too much chance, it would not be just the way to improve but the nostrength.
This is what economists call a paretyan improvement improvement improve.
A redistributation of the redance does all -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in except that it would be wrong for us.
To conclude, "Fico, you can become everything that I wanted,
You know, people of culture, think about it -- "What do that weight?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a vetrow."
"A cooled fall-aune vision vision of the world --
and I got it so I got it so forward.
But then, I realized that that fish the long fish known.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you sent the mouse of it, so that it is possible to be possible."
If you break the mouse so that everything you can decrease the decreens.
You get to get paralysis, and you get the benefit to be benefit to it.
Everybody needs a sphere.
This is almost certainly too much stretch -- maybe even fish, and certainly for us.
But the absence of some kind of symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic ones.
Thank you very much.
