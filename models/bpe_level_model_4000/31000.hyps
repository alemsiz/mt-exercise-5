Last year I showed these slides to show that the calculation that the articket glacial cal, which for almost three million years has had the size of 48 United States and the continental continental of the continental continental percent.
However, this undervalue because it doesn't show the ice of the problem because it doesn't show the ice.
The articket glacial calculation is, in a sense, the heart cleaner of the global climate system.
It expandes of winter and return it into the summer.
The next slide is going to be a quick fast on the last 25 years.
The lost ice lost seaunted in red.
As you see, you get to the dark blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue --
That's the ice in the winter, which is reverse of the summer.
You can see that the so-called the sea lost ice lost ice -- it's like the blood here of the body.
In 25 years old,
This is a problem because the heat care care of the glacious ground around the artic ocean where there are enormous amount of carbon congelated that that is a congelated with the microbes.
To the totality of the totality of the atmosphere of global warming, that amount of it may double, overcome come back.
In some deep in Alaska a few lagain in some of the water.

Video: Wow! At Gore: You're good. The question is if we are also going to be us.
A reason is that this termal exchange the Greenland from north.
This is a glacial record of glacial record.
The laughed has never reached levels.
This is the Kangerlusside-eper Bangerlussian of the Groenland in Groenland of Groenland Groenland --
If you want to know how to do the sea level of the sea ice of the ground, here is where the sea.
These currently currently currently.
On the other side of the planet.
The next month of the scientists have said that the ice of the ice is in negative, and the Antarctica, and the Antarctica, which is particularly quickly in some islands on the smooth and underwater skie.
Equival at six feet of water, like Groenland in Groenland,

The sea safe growing in the world leads to a nice of fixed fixed increases in the world leading to a nice that we have to have a remarkable growth of the mains.
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm and unprecedented and unprecedented it.
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years of previous 75.
This is a whole whole lot of unsustainable of all insustainable of all insustainable.
If you look in the history context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 to 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans.
Look at the East Pacific, from Amer, in the East East and in the subject of the subject continent, where there's a radical impoor of the oceans.
The greatest cause of global warming, together to deforestation, which is 20, the deforestation, which is 20, use fossil fuel fuel --
Oil's a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the most emissions, with the China.
And he proposed to build many other central central carbon central carbon central carbon cents.
But we're looking at a direction.
These are the projects in the last few years and some eviles.
At the way, there's a political lotta in our country.
The carbon industries and oil have 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon clean carbon clean carbon clean oxymore.
That image I reminded something --
Natalalalalalalso, in Tennessee, where I live, there was a 3.8 billion ganang gases of carbon dishes.
Maybe you see it on the news of news --
This is the second largest flow of scale in America.
It happened around Natal.
The natalization of one of the carbon industry was this.
Video: It's coal with carbon aio is a kind of hallegry and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is increasinger and more and more clean.
It's a good price, adorables, adorables, and the work are the skilling of it.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of the West Virginia.

Al Gore: So the Clima Proteation of Clima has launched two campaigns.
This is a one of it, a part.
Video: ALere: ALergives we see the climate changes as a serious change as a serious change in our business.
For this first of our priority is to invest a lot of money in a soul advertising and a bummmmming and truth truth truth to make it public truth truth to make it public and consummition to the carbon and consummit.
In fact, carbon is not spore.
We think it's clean -- it has also a good evidence.
So not preocuppage of climate change.
Let me do us.
Girle: Attore: Carbone clean -- you heard a lot of it.
So we do do it in a structure of the structure of the carbon structure of the clean as a chance of a clean as a sure.
Straordinary! The machines are a little noise, but this is the sum of the clean technology of the clean technology --
The carbon consumption is between the main causes of global warming, but the remarkable technology that you see change.
To look at this is the odiernate technology of the clean carbon technology --

If you want to go far away, you go together."
We need to go far fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED I made a TED I did a LHC.
And I promises to switch to go back to how the machine.
So there I am here I have. And for those that the other time they don't have to be there, the most big scientific experiment, ever attempt -- 27 miles of circumstance.
His job to reach the conditions that were present less than a billion of a second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
This is just the same environment.
This is the car under Gineva.
We do these min-Big Bang Bang in the relevel.
This is what I work on. It's called AS -- it's like 44 feet and it's a 2-feet diameter of 22,000 feet.
This is an ATLAS image of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
We have the 10 secember of the last year we accesor the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLATLAS.
It was because of a lot of empacks in the control.
It's a picture of the first particles of particles that had done all the LHC, entering into collision, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spreading particles into the relevel.
In other words, when we saw that image the 10 secember of that was a big living, which is a great live.
I don't know if it was doing this to do more than that, when somebody went to Google and saw on Google and saw that the initial page was this.
That means that we have a cultural impact over to the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact even about the scientific impact even even cultural impact beyond the scientific impact of that we have had a cultural impact on the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, because of these films.
These files are 13,000 printing when the machine works at the massive power of power.
Now, the technicians in you look at the films and saying, "It's not true. I'm filming --
And they can do it because when they're very fresh as they become the superconductors.
So, at least 271 degrees, at least 271 degrees, these films can bring that current.
In one of the junctures in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the files are reading to read read and 13,000 amps suddenly met a electrical resistence.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive if you think these magnets, most of 20 tons, and that have been moved about 30 centimeters.
They were damaged about 50 magnets.
We needed to get them to do it, what we did with it.
We have repristinated and uploads.
Now they're coming back to their place in their place on the place.
By the end of the end of the marze LHC is going to be new inteteer.
We accender, and we expect to get the right data or him, and we keep our adventure to find out what the morning to find out what the morning is the morning that are the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these fairly of the way, these accidents reaccending the debate of science and engineering. It's easy to confuse. It's easy to confuting.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I wish with the words of a scientist Inglese, Humphrey Davy, the guy, I think, in the defense of his experiments in his pupill, his pupill, Michael Faraday, said, "No is so dangerous for the progress of human-minded science is definitely dangerous for the progress of the brain is definitely new money.
Thank you.
I want to start to ask you to rethink about how kids, you play in the morning.
As you get to get them to get them and grab them, get them and to get them and sold them to think and solve problems and solve and solve problems and manipulating relationships.
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us.
So, as an informate, inspired by our physical objects, with my consultants, with my own consultant Pac, and my Jevan Kalanithi, I started asking "And if we use a computer, instead of having the only demand "And if we use a computer provide that it's going on on on a desktop, we could make it a digital provide information with entrepreneurily an information with ently man,
and we get it to our pleasant please?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building the answer, building the answer, building the Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable computer interactive computer.
In a few words, a Siftable computer interactive computer.
You can move with their hand, they can see their motion between them, feel like the motion and they have a screen and a wireless radio wireless.
But most physics, they're physical-physical objects, as the morning, you can just move it to just affect it --
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem for design information digital information.
And as they become more physicists, conscious than the movement, and others, as they become more physics, and as they become more physics, and as we did, we can explore, and others, as we die, we can exploring new interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Sifty is configured to show video: if you include it into a direction, the video will rotate it like this, if you include the other hand, you know, if you include the other hand, you know, if you include it in a way, the roade of the back.
These interactive ritrishes are conscious conscious rrrats of other people.
If you are in the ianic, you care what they inter around them.
If they come circumstances, they can get a little bit.
If they come circumstances, they can get a little bit.
They also have their movement and unlination.
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction of the interaction of the data, to be a colorful gesture, as a smood.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated as a greety brick and I can use them to address them to be about.
and I can use them to address them to the central color in that central color missing the color missing in the middle of the color in that central color in that central color in that central that in that middle missing to the color in that middle is to use them to address them to the color in the middle of the color in the midd
If we are too too much of it, we can put a little place.
There are also good possibility of learning -- like languages, the mathematics and games of the logic things that people can try to do the quickly and see the results of the results of the achievement,
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonaces that I do with a equation's program.
Here we have a game of words in Scarabeo and Boggle.
Moreously, at every turning on a letter to every Siftable, Pratically, every turnally, turns, and you get a letter to every Siftable, and while you try to make a dictionary he has a dictionary to a dictionary to a dictionary to a dictionary --
And then after about 30 seconds remissing them, and you have a new set of reading and new possibility.
Thank you.
This is what children came to the Middle Middle Lab, I did so that they tried them and turned a video.
They are very liked a lot of them.
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don't have to give you a lot of educations.
You just say, "Compone," and they know exactly what to do.
That's what other people who try it.
This is our younger testers,
It really wanted to employees.
They were only morning, for him.
Now, this is an interactive cartoon it.
We wanted to build a tool for learning loud the Lui is Felix.
It can put new characters in the scene, satisy in the scene, smart their associated with them.
It can put new characters in the scene, satisy in the scene, smart their associated with them.
So, it's doing the sun of the sun --
Video: The Sun is surgence.
David Merrill: Now he brought a treat in the scene.
Video: The treator arancient.
Bel job. Yeah. Yeah.
So Siftable and then savotable and can make the character --
Video: Bau!
--
Video: Hi, Hi,
DM: It's a story with a open final end of opening, and it can decide him as you know.
DM: It's a story with a open final end of opening, and it can decide him as you know.
Video: Gola via, four.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool -- to do recently -- to sample and execguing music.
It's a instrument, made recently, to sample, and executing music.
Siftable here act sounds like lower, lower and bacteria --
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what to use.
You can put these sounds in a compounds in a sequence sequence to your please.
And they just modify it just by doing it by doing and a sequence."
These are actually you can control from living -- like the reverberation and the file.
You attacks to a particular suit of a particular suit of suckets to the stage.
And then there are the effects as time and volume, which are apply to the sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We will try to put a basic in two Siftable "sequence."
I'm now going to put a bask.
DM: DM: DM: Now add of the other people's --
Video: DM: And now I'll put the bacteria, so I can control the effect of living in the live.
DM: DM: I can speak the whole sequence sequence by a side or the other.
DM: DM: And now I'm add to add the bottom to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombined the sequence "voles."
So I don't have to plannit before, but I can improvide it longer or more corn.
And now, finally, I can smoke, the whole sequence by the left the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces of man-machine more similarge-like brain and the body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this losing results, and also some possibilities that we try to bring out from the laboratory.
The concept that I want to transmmitate is that it's coming this new generation of objects to interact with digital media media in our world in the way we want to get this whole way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a writer.
Srenter books is my professional extension is more than that, of course,
It's also love and the fall of my life.
And I don't expect that it can change.
But I said, something particularly happened in my life and in my careeer, who was brought to realibrate the whole relationship with this work.
The thing is that I was recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, a different prize, and a few reasons, for some reason he came out of my world and became a great way, senseerals, and he became a great sense, senseery interaction.
And the result is that everywhere in the time people treat me as if I was convicted to me.
It's true -- condamed, condge.
They all come to me to all concerned and they say, "Do you don't afraid to do better.
You don't keep keeping writing for all of life without being able to create a book that can care of creating a book that can care to somebody?"
that can matter somebody?"
It's rassicurant, you know.
But it could go worse to the worse than 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I was a writer.
I was going to meet the same reaction reaction of the fear.
And people said, "Don't you teme not to have success?
Do you don't fear that the hummiliation kill?
You don't afraid to do this mestise all of life without that anything is ever coming out and die on a comulation of saming in saming with mouth of saming energy.
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is "Yes."
I paint of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also have a lot of other things that people can't have to guess it.
Like the algae and other things suset.
But as I think about the writing what I thought and ask me the late is why?
Is it rational?
It's logical that anyone who should be susending from a job that you feel in to be sent to do.
But what is it particularly in the impresuming creative to make it nervous health is about the mental health care of a way that other people don't do this?
Like my father, for example, he was a chemistry engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which was asked if he was afraid engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be a chapter and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which was asked if he was asked if he he he was asked if he about it if he was afra
It was never -- that block of engineer John, how do it happen?
It didn't work like this, you know, you know,
Onestly, the chemical engineers are not certainly in the secure of the seats, and the reputation of being alcolized.
We writers, we have enough this reputation and not only writers but creatives of all genere, we have this reputation of being enormously instable, and we have this reputation of being enormously instable,
And it's not another to look at the tristage of magnifies of magnifies that creative is that only in the 2th century, they dirange young people and often for them.
And also those who are not suicide they seem to be really dismissed by their women.
Norman Mailer, before I die, in the last interview said, "Of my book has killed me a little bit more extraordinary her, about the work of its life.
But we don't drink when we feel like that, because we heard these things so much long-way we have completely interiorized and accept the notion of creativity and suffering are somehow you and heart it will be a few way you and art, to the enjoy and the art, and then will always be the angoshely.
And the question I want to bring to all of today?
It is good for you -- because even watching it from a hundred distance to me not good for this suppose.
I think it's hate to it.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see it perpetuate in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great minds to live.
And because I know that in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to that feeling about the suppositions, in my career.
And it is -- unsum water, I'm pretty young people -- I have about 40 years old.
I still have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely to write about now and then it will be judged by the world as the work that came after the world as the work that came after after the last book.
I'm going to be slave, because we're all more or less friends here -- is probably my greatest successful is to my shoulder.
Oh, Gesus down, who think!
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads to a person to start by, to start bing gin and morning I don't want to do it.
I would keep doing this work that we do.
So, the question becomes you about, do you know?
And so I think, after many reflective reflective of working to write that is to create a psychological costruck costruck psychological costruck costruck or what?
I have to have a few way to find a security distance between me, which I am writing the one that reaction that he written to get to the very year and trying to get to look for all the time to do it as you begin to look at the time, trying to find other societies that they could have better ideas and more healthy healthy healthy ideas and more health and more blood than that reaction that he write to be able to get some of security
how to help people create the emotional risks of creative risks of creativity.
And that research led me to the ancient Great and ancient Roome.
Seguitems because it gets back in circle and then back back.
In ancient Green and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity is the creativity of man, OK?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit watching the death of the men somewhere to humans somewhere away, men are unknown away.
The green were called these spirits of creativity dians of creativity in the creativity of the creativity of these spirits called "demony."
Socry, wonderful, he believed to have a demone that heavy wisdom to be a far away.
The Roman's same idea, but they called that spirit without a genius of spirit without a genius
Which is great, because the Romans didn't think that a genius was really smart genius was a smart.
They thought a genius was this sort of divine entity in the wine walls in the walls of the study of artist, a little like the Dobby, and who came out to assisting the job of the artist of that I think about the job and model the result of that work.
Ecceptional -- yeah, that is the distance of what I talk -- that costruck costruck that protects you from the results of your work.
And everybody knew that it was so so that it was so so that it worked, right?
So the ancient artists were protof circle, like the too narcissnarcisssets, right?
If your work was exceptional job doesn't be able to take all the demer, everybody knew that he was helped by this genius of the incorporeum.
If your work fail, it was not all the be, right?
Everybody knew that it was your genius to be a incapable to be a unable to be a unable to be a unable to be a inabout.
And so people han conceived the creativity in the Ocker for a long time.
And then the Researlier came and all of this idea; we put the human being in the middle of the universe over all the kinds of the universe and mysteries that write of the divince and no longer creatures that write details.
This was the principle of humanity rational humanity. And people started to think that creativity was completely from the ishelf of the ishelf of the idivide of the human creativity and people begin to think that creativitvity of the humanity.
And for the first time in history, it started to reference this or that artist as a genius to a rather than a person with a genius to a person with genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big mistake.
I think that allowed someone to believe somebody -- a simple person to believe being like a recipient as a source as a source and the surprising mysteries, creativity, unknowable and eths is a responsibility for a three-big strong to the fragile that human.
It's like to ask somebody to ingoid to ingoe the sun --
It decreates the ego completely and create all these ingestible ingestive expectations to performance.
And I think it was this pressure to have destruct the artists in the past.
And, if this is true, and I think it is, and I think it becomes it?
Can we do it different?
Maybe go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery creative mystery of the relationship of the relationship between humans.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cut 500 years of thinking about a 18 minutes.
And there's probably people in the audience that it would have been suspicing scientific suspes on the notion of the notion of the notion of the notion of the uncle of the un-fairly fairly in the audience that they are going to the next to their projects.
It probably won't convince you all on this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why no?
Why don't you think about this in this way?
Because it has more sense of everything that has ever ever heard to explain the exasperant of creative process.
A process that as anybody who ever has tried to do something -- so fundamentally, all here -- yeah, it doesn't rationally because.
And, in fact, it can sometimes look like a completely paranormal.
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poetc. Ruth Stone, who has now 90 years old, but it was a poet-in-old infant in the Virginia, worked out in the Virginia, and he was working out in the field, and he felt it in the country.
He said it was like a fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous of the air.
And that was rolling to the landscape.
It was going to get to the way to do the land under its feet.
He knew that I had one thing to do to do that point and it was -- words about, "run."
And so it was going to go home and it was just following it from this poeem and he wouldn't have to take a piece of paper and a match of a paper -- and they collecting it on the page.
Sometimes he couldn't be pretty quickly, so it was so fast and running without getting to get home and the poem and the poem was going to go to home and then he was going to break through the landscape, and he would keep rotolating the landscape, as a poeter."
And then there were times -- this piece I don't forget that -- there were no time when it was almost lossleeping times?
So, she was running at home and was trying to paper and the poem was going to crossing, and he was a marked in the way that she was going on, and then he said that it was like to hand the office and the off.
He was going to have the poem of the tail and it in his body and transmitted it on the page.
And in these cases, the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intacts of the last word at the first word at the first word to the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the same time.
So when I felt like -- it's crazy to my creative process.
Not my creative process -- I'm not a conducted.
I'm a mulation, and my way to work is -- wake up to the same orary every day and to work and pass over over the time and to work on the way over the enjoy of the time and deeply to the same beard.
But even I was in my head, in my head, I strike up with that thing, at times.
And I guess many of you have,
You know, even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source source of unexpected source.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to it in a way we don't lose your head, but but to do it stay with it?
And as it really, the best contemporary example that I have is the Tom Waits, which I interviewed a different years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life was the incarnation of the artist of the artist remented account, trying to control these species of creatives creatives of totally interiorized.
But then he sususpect that, and one day while she was driving on a authoh in Los Angeles, changed all of him.
It was going to go speed and all of a melodia, which is a little framement of it that comes in in his head as it makes the inspiration, elusive, and the wish -- you know, it's wonderful, and the wishe's wish and the wishe, but not as you get it.
It doesn't have a piece of paper, it has no matite, it has no recorder.
So it starts to feel this sort of old anxiety to him, "I'm going to losing this song is a losessional session.
I'm not good enough."
And instead of going to the belt stop.
He did the whole mental process and made something completely new.
He just looked at the sky and said, "cus," I don't see that I'm driving you?"
"Do you look like a song nove?
If you really want exists, it goes to a more opport, when I can take care of you.
Other of the triment, you to get someone else today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process changed after that.
Not the work, the work even even as well as well as well as well.
But the process, and the fishing range that was released when the genius, the genius, the genius that came out of him causing nothing else about problems and liberated it back.
but it benefiting, wonderful bizarking, wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this thing that was not Tom.
So how the story that the story started to change a little bit the way I worked and already saved me a time.
This idea, he saved me when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, and falling in one of the disperation that we all when we are working on something and we can't start to think that it's a disaster, which is going to be a deaths ever write it was writing about that the worst writer book ever written to write it.
Not just bad written book written book.
And I started to think about throw this project.
But then I reminded from the Tom who talked to the air and trial.
So I went to my face to the hands of the many, and I would say my job to a room.
And I said, "What is that if you say, "Look, whatever it is not going to be bright to be bright to not be bright to be bright at mine, right?
Because as you see what I'm doing is doing is I don't have any more than that.
So if you want to be better you have to introduce and do your parts.
Okay. But if you don't do you do do you know what, I don't do it anything.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to favor that was recorded that I was to do my own particular." Because it is actually -- at the end of the North Africa in the North Africa Africa in the North Africa in the North Africa --
And they were always magnificent because the ballers were great professionals.
But every lot of it was going to be a lot of these artists became actually transmanding.
And I know that you know what I am talking about it, because I know you have seen all a certain point, a lossing way.
It was like the time you stop it, and the ballery walking through a kind of portal and was not doing anything different from the sun, like 1,000 nights before, but all of the 1,000 notes, but all the halling.
And suddenly it doesn't seem like a human being.
But it turns out of divince in and detail in the fuel of divinity.
And when this next to the time this was the time -- people knew what he was, they called him his name.
They used their hands, and they started singing, "Allah, Allah, God Dio, God God, God, God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know.
Curious note -- when the Moreous Morean of Spain, they took this abitude with their and the ready uncle of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, O, Oul, Oly; Of course, --
In Spain, when a artist has done something impossible and magic -- "Hey, please Go hood, halley, you know, a flew of God.
And it's great, because we needed it.
But the problem comes the next day after the baller's morning -- when you wake and discovering that are the 11 in the morning of Martedesday and finally last God is not more.
It's just a mortal with a great deaths to the knee, and maybe never can be able to be able to be to do that altee.
And maybe nobody will be the name of God still yet, and what do it have to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to do in a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angoshing if you can not believe that, but for the most extraordinary aspects of your being come from you to yourself,
But I just believe that there are data in the pristely imaginable of this team of this team of your life that you have to go to somebody.
And, you know, if we think of this is all change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's because I thought about it as I thought for a lot of a lot of the work that I will soon on prester, the dangerous spectacextired to my greatest success.
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel elected by this is, not having ear.
Let me just do your job. It only does your work.
It is to introduce your parts, any can be.
If your work is dance, bally, bally.
If the divine, assurd, assigned you a little bit of leaving a few kinds of wonderful -- for a moment through your effort through your effort sweets, then "O!"
Other of the triment, you do the same thing.
And "Oh, no!" to you know the same thing.
I think I think I think it should teach it.
"He!" to yourself." And even for the human and testing talks to the same, and talks to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be able to introduce the human beings.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Oh, !
And as you know I've already talked about some of these projects on human genome and what can mean and discovery new genes.
Now we're beginning to have a new percorsound, we started digitalizing biology and now to the way to go into a new fashion of biology, designing and sympts, designing and sympting and life.
We always tried to ask the questions.
"What is the life?" is something that many biologists I don't think that we have attempted to understand levels.
We tried a different approach, reducing to minimmes.
We're typing for almost 20 years ormay.
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to the world of the analog world of the digital world of the digital world world.
Now we ask our: can we do regenerate life to this digital universe from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organism -- Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from the genome genome between those that can authorities.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a even smaller even smaller.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the metabolic map to its metabolic map to the nostr.
I, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate -- one at the time, it's very improbable that this can bring a cell.
So we decided that the only way to make it synthetize this chromosome, so that we could make the components to bring some of these questions.
And so we started the adventure of the "Can we can synthesize a chromoso?"
Can the chemistry to produce these big molecules that never have been able to create before we have never been able to create before you?
And, in case that we can make a chromosound?
A chromosome, it's just a piece of chemical material chemical material.
The speed we are able to digitalize life is growing to reach the life is growing at the exponential res.
Our ability to write the genetic code, ageing, but it's improving slowly, but it's improving.
And our most recently results, the leading to be exponential curve.
We started over 15 years ago.
And the process has required a lot of the past, starting with a bioetic review before we started the first experiments.
But we found that I'm going to synthesize DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produce little segmental segmental proces: the most segmental proces: the most segment of the segment is longer than the segment is longer than 30 to 50 letters of them.
So we had to develop this new method to assemblate these fragments and reaching the mistake of the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt to start to start digital information of the Phi X-174.
It's a little virus that kills bacteria.
We designed the fragments, effective reporting the mistake of the mistake of about 5,000 letter of DNA of about 5,000 letter --
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material and we put it into bacteria bacteria started reading this genetic code and to produce particles.
The virals have been released by cell phones, they go back and they fill the E.
I talked about recent members of the petrolife's saying that they certainly understood this model.
They have more than you.
We believe this is a situation where the software can really build his hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things larger on.
We wanted to build the bacteria of the bacterium.
It's about 580 miles in the genetic code --
So we thought we built in the size of the viruses of viruses so that we can change the cassette to understand what the components of a living cell.
The design is crucial and if we start with digital information, in a computer, these must be very accurate it.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995, the standard accuracy was of a mistake for every 10 midror midset.
We have discovered -- we have been resequencing that original sequence we never had that original sequence we never have been able to do it work.
A part of the process is designing down to the 50 letters that are overwhelming with all the other segments of 50 letters to build underunits to build underunit smaller than 50 letters to build underunits to build underunits to make underunits to design subunit to build underunits to design subunits to design underunit is
We try to try to add elements here.
You probably have read that we put in the slumn of the fold.
Think of it this is: We have a genetic code based on four letters: A, C, G.
Three of those letters together with about 20 adminioids, and there's a specific order to be a specific order to be,
So we can use the genetic code for writing words, fraass, fraass.
What we did in the beginning was authographing.
Some of them have been dolphuses from the fact that it was not poetry.
We designed these sat these sat at at them just to join the encies.
There are enzymes that repair them and put them with them.
And we started assembling of parts, starting with five to seven miletter from five to seven miletter to be able to form sitting in 24 miles in a way to get to 72 letter to get to 72 letter to the letter to get to 72 letter letter to get to 72 letter letter to segments to the lead to get to
And we have produced these checks in the abundance that we are trying to create a very robate production that we're trying to create a very robate production -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems to the tabellon a basketer of a basketer's tabellon it.
When we get these checks at these very long cheap segments are going to be directly in E.
You get to the limits of the modern molecule.
So we looked at some other mechannels.
We knew another mechanism called a homological recombination of homology, which is useful to repair DNA to join the DNA to unide DNA to unize the segments.
Here's one example.
This organism -- this organism called Deinococcus radio harans, it can absorb three million rad of radiation.
You can see in the distract of the distructure,
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that have been able to do it.
These organisms can be able to get complete complete with it.
They can live under empty.
I'm absolutely absolutely that life existing in space, and you get to find new rich environments.
NASA showed that this availed avene.
This is a molecule that we built using these processes -- just using these processes -- just using the lights of the unserious design.
The lights put them automatically.
This is not taken with a photo was taken with a electronic microscope with a regular.
It's a molecule so big that we can see it with a microscope with a slight-light-delight-delight-to-wer.
These are picture that they cover a period of six seconds.
This is the advertisest that we did a little time ago.
It's over 580,000 letters of genetic code --
It's the largest molecule of a defined structure that ever created by man.
It has a 300 million million.
If we spent it with a 10 paper without spaces, it would take 142 pages to get this genetic code to get this genetic code to get this genetic code --
Now, how do we work work? How do we do it?
Of course, you get a virus is a game by kids.
It's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria it.
It's also simpler when it's eucariote as a our-cells as our -- you can just extract the nucleus and put another one of them -- which is basically the clone.
In the bacteria the chromosome, it's integrated in the cell but we have recently demonstrate that we can do a complete train a cell of a chromosome.
We can refuse a parting from a microbial species.
The two are different as the topies.
We added a few genes in a way that we could decide what to do for this chromosoon.
It then has shown with the enzymes so that they killed all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cell was stupending -- and you will open our graphic sophisticato-- the new chromosome.
And we really thought we couldn't go to the three, but we tried to get it more in there.
This is one of the greatest mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a lot of tanti-species. They added a second or a third chromosome, added in a second thousands of new tracks to that species.
So who think about evolution as only a gene to evolution that has not understood a lot of the biology.
There are enzymes called restripes of restripations, is that even the DNA DNA --
The chromosome that was in the cell of it has no one.
The cell pho-chromosomes we have inserito--take.
And it turns out, and it recognizes the other chromosome, as a lower material as a material material, and we found with only the cell and the new chromote and the new chromote and the new chromosome.
It became blue because of the genes we have inserved.
And in a short time of all the characteristics of a species have gone in a very special -- and it transformed all in a new software that we put in in a new software that we put in in the cell phone.
All the protein has changed membranes have changed and when we read the genetic code balance code is what we transfited.
Now, this might seem alchemia seem alchemicals, but altering DNA things can change things in a pretty substantial.
Now, I explained that this is not talking about genesesis -- but progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution, and I said that maybe we're to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion process.
Why do I do that?
I think it's obvious, when we think of our needs.
We're going to go from six billion people to nine in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946; 40 years, there will be four or it will be four or four or it will be four or every single one.
We're having trouble now to find food, water and clean and clean, medicination, medicination, and drink for six and a half billion people.
It will be more hard to do it for nine billion.
We use more than five billion carbon dion, more than 30 billion barrels.
That means a million barrels a day.
When we try to find biological processes or whatever the process to rempirate it, it will be a enormous challenge.
We have to keep the whole hemission of CO2 from these materials that end in the atmosphere.
At the day of today's today's scientific discoveries in all over the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are designed for the future.
The electronic industry has only a dozen about components, and think about how many things have come out of them.
Our limits here are the data is principlely by biological reality.
Now we have some techniques that thank you very quickly unintization, can create what we call it combination generates combinator.
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day.
Think of process. Tease these 20 million genes or try to get the processes to produce either either either vaccines, we can change -- we can change because of a little team, and create more biology molecular biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard section.
We can pick up for chance of survival, or carbon dioxietc.
This is an instantanea few software programmed by which we're working to be able to sit and design species to be able to sit and designing species to the computer.
Well, we don't know what they are doing.
We know exactly what their genetic code is their genetic code --
Now we're focusing on the carbon carbon carbon coals.
You also see you who extract ethanoll was a male experiment was a bad experiment.
We have carbon depending on and third generation that will come quite soon as the cooker as the either as the either as the either either as the either as a either of the sloping or different kinds of skills.
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing impact without increasing the cost of food and limiting the delilibility is to transform the CO2 cells in material, that we're working for designing cells that can achieve this purpose, and we are going to be able to get this purpose, and we are going to be the first carbon dioxiety.
The sunlight, solar with CO2 is a method -- but in our discoveries all over the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep ocean to about 2,500 feet to the eboiling temperature of water.
It creates meter CO2 molecular hydrogen molecular hydrogen molecular energy as a source source.
We're trying to figure out if we can get to do CO2, which can easily be transportated by tubes, converting that CO2 in order to drive this process.
So short we think we might think we be able to increase what the basic question "what the life" is Noi, true -- we have the modest of replace to replace the whole petrochemical industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you can?
It would be a main function of energy --
And in the other way we are working on using to use the same methods to create the instantanei.
You saw this year with the flu we are always backed back.
I think that what you can change by building combinable vaccines in anticipe.
This is how the future could start to look change, now, the tree of evolution, accelerating evolution with bacteria -- archaai, and finally finally cells -- arching eucaries.
We are so much to improve people.
Our purpose is to do it so much to try to do it with a lot of trying to do it. Thank you very much.
Before all I will do you see the most rapidly possible, some fundamental job that we took to the Microsoft to a nearly aque. This is Seadragon.
It's about a environment where you can interact is a local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data --
We're seeing a lot of gigabyte of digital photos, with a kind of a short zoom and continue, for a panoramic speed, display in the images as we want.
And it doesn't matter how much the amount of information that we see -- how big these data collects or images.
Most of them are common photographs, but this is a scanning from the Bioke, and it's a scanning from the Library of Congress, and it comes into the 300 megapix.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time. It's also a very flexible architecture. It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a whole book of data that is not imagined by images.
This is Dickens. Every column Casa capitule.
To share you to show you that it's just a test and not imagines, we can do something like this, to do something like a real representation of the head, not of a photos.
It could be a little artificial way to read a electronic book.
Don't you recommen.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian number of "The Guardian.
Every image is the beginning of a section.
And it really gives you the pleasant experience of reading the load version of a magazine or a fifth of a fifth of a fifth of a fifth of a meeting.
We also did something with the angle of this number in the Cardian.
We made a lot of resolution in high resolution -- much more than what you use in a normal publicitity; and we put in the extraordinary content in the extraordinary content that you used to be extraordinary content in the same trade.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specific specific exists.
And this really demonstrate some of these ideas to heliminate the limits of space on the screen.
We hope this lady to put a pop-up pop-up and some other porkes, not to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And on this I don't want to lose time, if we don't say that we have contributed to this field.
These are all the streets in the United States overs over a geospace of NASA.
So now we're going to go to something else.
This is now now now in the webs; you can see it on the webs; you can see it on the webs;
It's a project called Photosynth, which fights two different technologies.
A is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer research to do very interesting to the computer computer at Noah Snavely, a student of Washington, with the aid Steve Seitz UWashington, with Microsoft Research Research Szski Research. A great collaboration.
And it's from the web, and I managed to the web, and it was in the web,
You can see it when we do this kind of screens, where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience of resolution is multiply.
But the space collection of images here has actually a meaning.
The sleoritming of the computer visualization has recorded these images together, so that they correspond to the real places, where the imagines -- all of the Montaghi Grassi on Montagne Roccial Lits; they have been taken here. So you see the elements of a slide-showing panoramic imaging panoramic and that things have been connected to space
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some of them much more space.
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noah-- and this is from a previous Photosynthosynthy of the first time last summer -- to show what I think is really the chievement of this technology, Photosynth. And it's not necessarily so much evident at the environment of the environment that we put in the environment that we put in the We.
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on.
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images Flickr. Basta digital reconstructed Notre Dame in Flickr and you get images of the camps. And you get images of these argue around. Every one of these argues around. Every one of these around.
So they're all required images from Flickr and have been connected to this way.
And it's possible to navigate this simple way.
You know, I would never have thought to be finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very free to get this kind of account here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of fotoer: from those of the SLR, a a significant number of these things in this environment.
And if I can try to try to look for those older things.
Many are blocking, etc.
Something here is a series of photography -- there it is a series of photographs -- there it is.
This is a Notre poster Dame recorded correctly.
We can go from the physics to the physical view of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment of it. This is now now now now now from the whole collective -- from collective internal memory of how to appear -- and all those data together.
All those photo become connect and more than the sum of the parts.
You have a model of the entire land that emerge.
Think about this as a prolunging work of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual Turge.
It's something that grows in complexity as people use it, and the advantage of the uses of who uses it are increasing with use.
Their photos are marked with methames from other people.
If somebody comes the idea of delivering all these sants says, my name, my picture of the Cathal Caths suddenly arrich of all those data, and I can use it as a point to switch to the space, in that metaphor to get that space, in that metaphor to get a picture of anybody else, and have a social experience-cross-red social and cross-red experience of these data, and have a red red and have a a social experience.
Of course, a consequence of all of this is very highly elaborate models of all the interesting of the earth of the earth -- they don't only see on airplane and satellitarian memory, but from collective.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized what your software are going to do is that at a certain point, in the next few years, all the way in the next few years, all the interact in the world or be connected to anybody in the world or they are basically connected together?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing is doing is actually discovered.
It's creating hyperlink, if you want to do hyperlink, in the images.
And it's doing it in the content of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about wealth of the ancient information that many of these images are possible.
As you do a research for images on the Web and the text on the Web page on the Web page of the picture.
Now, what if that picture you connect to all your phote?
So the amount of of semant interconnection and the amount of riccheality that is really enormous about is really a classical effect. It's a classical effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the pleasant pleasant when you travel and one of the inngraphic research is the way to live in who has not forgotten the traditional antiques in the wind, towards the past in the wind, towards the sloping in the wind pieces of plants.
You think that the shamans Jaguar travel even beyond the Milay, or that the Bay, or the Inuit is still a meaning of meaning -- or in Himalaya, the budgy of the Dhar, to remember the importance of the Dharmor of the idea that the world in which which we live in a sense of sensensensensensensensensense, but it's just a model of reality, but it's just a model of the reality,
the consequence of a particular adaptive choices that our stops has done, good or mal, a lot of generations ago.
And, of course, we all share we sharing essential tracts.
We all hidden it. We all grow up.
We are subject to the way of the initiation.
We have to deal with the inesorability of death, so we don't have to be whale,
We all have an art.
What it is the most cross-rhythm of any culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Borneo, or the Borneo, or the Haiti, or the Haiti, or the warriors of the Caisevent in Kenya secentrierial of Andia, or a camellield of the Shara.
He was my company in the desert a month -- or a month ago, or a welever of the Qomolang, on Everest, the mother of Mound's mother of the world.
All of these people teach us that there are other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of them to move in the world.
And, if you think a moment, it's a concept that it can give you hope.
Insiemes, the cultures of the world create a spiritual and cultural life that makes a spiritual and cultural and is important for the benefits of the planet as a biosphowever, as a biosphow, as a biosphosphery.
And you can think about this ran of this raise as a ethnosfer and you can define the ethnoxietnosfer the sum of all the concepts, dreams, ideas, inspirations, intuitions led to being from the high imagination of the consciousness.
Electure's greatest pathrimony.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how much species;
And because biosphere has been very consumed as much as it has happened to ethnosfer and unfortunately too faster.
No biologist, for example, it would say that 50 percent of all the species is on the eastern orate because it's just fail, in the most apocalittic -- in the field of biological diversity -- and you don't have to be a little bit of the hypothesesis of the most opintimistic diversity of all cultural diversity.
The indicates all of this is, of course, loss;
When you're born 6,000 languages on this planet.
A language is not only compost by a vocabulary or a series of rules grammaticals.
A language is the pushing of the human spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit.
It's the half of which animation of every culture comes in the material world.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a sweter ecosystem of the spiritual possibilities.
And of those 6,000 langues, as we sit in Monterey, at least half is not more sussurrying in the ears of the children.
They don't get more teacher than to the children, who wants to say, unless than to do something that they did.
What is it more tristage of being the silence, of being the silence, the last talk to a language, of not having a way to transmit the sad of addition or anticipate the promise of the kids?
This is a fed in a few weeks in some of the world every two weeks a couple weeks a little bit die and door and door and leaves with the ultimate language.
And I know somebody to say, "Is it not the way that there?
The world would not be a better place if we were all the same language in the same language -- then we talk all yoruba. We talk all yoruba. We talk about a meoruba.
Let's talk about it.
You will find a tract thing that means you can't talk to the language.
I would like to do a journey through the ethnosferap through the ethnosferap --
a little journey in the ethnospher's labor to give you a above what we're losing out.
Many of us forget that when I say, "different ways of existing existing ways of existing existing ways of exists.
We take for example this Barasana, in Amazonia in Sepentrion -- the population of anacony, which creates the population of anacony, which credes to come from the layer of the east of the east of the sacric sacries.
It's a population that it's not able to distinguish the green color of the green because the celeste is identified in the forest time of the forest, which depends the population.
They have a strange language and a marriage rule -- said, "Heogamia language -- "Howeight a person who talks a different language.
And all of that has rooted in the past, the particular arm is that in these extremely families in which you are in these very low-lense family marriages.
They are just just listening to and then they start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived -- the Waorani of Ecuador nororal, an incredible popular that has had the first contacts in 1958.
In 1957 five missionarized a facial mistakes,
They have taken from the top photography that they would think of a few who thought of friends, dimenticating that this population of the pluvial forest, he had never seen bi-dimensional bi-dimensional bi-dimensional forgoing.
They collected the pictures of the ground, they were looking for a form or a shape or a figar and they have killed the figen that you were handed with the diavole, and they killed the five missionaries with the lames.
But the Waorani didn't kill the straniera.
They killed in them.
54 percent of the death was caused by their own sex.
We are eight generations and we found two of natural more, and we found two of natural more, and when we put it for saper, they admitted to be so that they died again to again and then they killed it the same, and then they killed it the same incredible knowledge.
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the first '80s, I was assigned a really interesting job when my professor at Harvard asked me to go to Haiti to go to Haiti to intrufolding between Duvalive society to Duvales and Tonton Macoutes, and the Tonton Macoes, and they were sessing to do the velended up with it.
And to make sense of the miracle of the miracle Vodoun and that the Voodoo is not black magic magic magic is not black magic magic magic culture and that the Voodoo is not black magic magic magic culture,
It's quite a metaphor or complex.
Very interesting.
If I asked you to tell the big religions of the world, what would I say?
Cristianity, Islam, Buddismo, Ebraism, etc.
A continent is always leaves, by thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious hasn't lightened religious and the Voodoo is nothing distilled distilled of these religious religious concepts of the slave of the back.
What makes you interesting the voodor is the intent of the life and death.
So you live your own own own spirits.
The spirits can be invocated by the Grande Aqua, and they replaced themporate to the range of the dance and they replaced themporanely to the animate alive so that for a short active deal.
For this voodooisters like "You want to white you go to a lot of God.
We give us in the temple and become God."
And from the moment that you are posssedumble, how can you do it?
So you look at these incredible events -- following your voodor in the state of tracking impunctum impunctum of the mind on the body when it's catalyzed in a state of the mind in a state of extreme extreme in a state of extreme extreme.
And all the people who who I lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada Santa Marcket's Santa Marcket in the Colombia sect secentrional sect.
It turns out that you have a tyrance that once they live on the careers of the Colombic Colombia in attesa of cook-reach massive vulcanic massive board, the people get to the heart of the carbe.
In a macky continent -- this population has never been conquered by the shagnote of the spagnoes.
On the today's today are government in a clack but their formation is just extraordinary.
The young people following away from the family, and they live in a secregated world of good and homber in a world made of good and homber in the basis of the ice for 18 years.
Two period of nine years of reproducing the nine months of the developing nine months of the management of the mother, are now metaphors in the uteration of the Madre.
For all this time, they get acculturned to their society, values that they previous and their prayer to their prayer and only their prayer balance -- or to say the conmidition -- or to say the ecologic balance.
At the end of this incredible initiation, they all brought up and for the first time in their lives, at the age of 18 years, they see a alba. And in that actime-border, when the sun sun sun and sun is a beautiful landscape, all of what they have learned in theory is conference. The pret of the beautiful splendor. The pret of this undreamed in theory is a past behind and saying,
"Do you know what I said I said to you.
It's stupend. Now it's looking at you. Now it's protect."
They call them the greatest brothers and say that us, the miners, we are the hitcholical of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think of the Indian population and invote the environment and the old story of the wild noble wildlife of the noble nowildy in his simplicity or maybe invote in his simplicity or maybe we tell these populations are closest in us.
The indegenes are not feeling that is not feeling that no indebolites from our algy.
There is no space for these things in the malaric stage. And there's no way of the Tibet, but because it's time and the rituals that the Earth can live in the same way that you can live in the same as well as a little bit more subject untuize, but on an ununtouches and human consciousness, the conception that the Earth can live because it's unknowing of human.
What does that mean?
That means that a guy in the Ande of the Ande that is a montagain that the mountain is a spirit that it will be a human being being being deeply different and will have a drink of a mountain or that a Montana Montana sounds or that a Montana growing girls is growing that a mountain of rock that a mountain is a mountain a Montana who is shake of rock
which is the death of a spirit or a cut is irrizing.
What is interesting is the metaphor is the metaphor and the natural world.
I grew up in the Britann's forests, which was actually credying forest to be cut.
That has made me a human being different from my friends in Kwautl who believe that the forests are the Hukukukuk and the beat the beat the wild and the spirits of the wridges that live in the world, the spirits that deal with the world that deal with the Hukey inda.
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually create different reality, you can start to understand some sense-discovered res,
I took this picture to aprile in the nordoctor.
Maybe some of you have heard of the ayahuase, the most powerful repertoxic repertoium.
What makes it fascinating from the ayahuas's potential of the substance, but its processing. It's made by two elements. It's made by two elements.
From a hang -- this legnose that has a series of beta-carboline, harmine and a molans, harmine of the weapon bat,
And by taking the only plant planta flum that you can get a little bit of consciousness, but it's measured with the leaves of coffee family, and it lived in the coffee of coffee.
This is a planta planta is a very similar to the serious serious to the serious meltrypty methoxyltryptamine-5, methoxyltryptamines.
If you ever see the Yanomami in the hidden that they do from a different set of species, anchecks that are doing from a special set of species, anchoxyltryptamines.
Tird that polyming is a little bit like being shooted by a filled filled with a board, the slopink of electricity. It doesn't believe a distore.
I was often going to get my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who took the psychological fungamental fungamental fungamental fungamental fungamental fungamental funge.
And I think my testhesis is not to be classified to these triptogens because if you're done not telling any of being hallucinated with a bird of the bird that they can't be a sucky that you find out of course in the intestines that you find naturally in the intestinous intestinoxyye.
It's possible to be assume only if you put it with other chemicals that denious chemicals that denial the MAO.
Now it's the beautiful is: Callopes that are in this lian inbator of the same kind of necessary for triptamines. The question of the triptamines. The question will be able to a flower of 80,000 species of plants, how do these people find two dialkings, but if you combine in this way, I think if you combine in this way, and they think if you combine in this sum of part?
We use the great euphemism of the proof the proof of the proof infrutting.
But if we ask Indians, they will tell us "Liter"
What does that mean?
This tribe, Cofan, has 17 variety of ayahuas's huase, which distinguishes nitely into the same species.
If we ask them how they stabilize their pocsonomy will tell us how to be able to be plants, of the rest I said, "No."
The solution is, you get 17 variety variety in a night of the moon and each one will be with a different way.
With this not a Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to count the stames.
Now, the problem is that also the problem is that also the ones of us who have heart people who have to give them a painting in but somehow you get into the margin of the history of our real world and passes the sea real, and it back.
In fact, the XX-century, 300 years old, not will remind for his wars or its technology, but rather like the age of technology that but rather like the age of the way we stopped actively or accepted to the massive destruction of biological diversity and cultural diversity and cultural diversity and cultural diversity of the planet. Now the problem is not change.
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance of new chance of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians have no stopped being Siouxoux when they put them on the arrate and fresh as Americans have no stopped being Americans when they put them from the horse and calculus hot.
It's not the change or technology that threat the ethnosfer.
The domination.
And if you give a look at the world, you will find that these are not destiny cultures.
It's living creatures and dynamics and dynamics that will be identifiable to identify their ability to adaptation.
I'm a disbodishing in the pathric of Penan:

It is ready to report the staks with the rainforest.
Or, in the case of Yanomami, are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the golden of the golden gold.
If we move on on the Turbet, where I'm doing a lot of research, where I'm doing a lot of research, you see the harmor of the political money.
As you can know the genocide the genocide of a popular popular population, but the ethnocidium of a popular popular popular style, not only convicted condness, but celebrated in certain environments, because it makes part of development.
And you can't understand the Tibet of Tibet until you start to the beginning.
I lost the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the West Chengdu through the Tibet southal South East in Lhasa young line, but only came to Lhasa a young line, and I realized what is behind the statistics we feel about it.
6,000 monuments sacred money.
1.2 million people killed by military military during the Cultural volution.
The father of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama.
That means that it means that it was killed at the time of the Chinese invasion of agaddition --
Her is was fighting with Santity in the Santity during the diaspora in Nepal.
His mother was imprisoned and her her she'd be rick.
It was brought to the hold at at the age of two years born away, because it couldn't live without him.

A day he winavverted a day a fashion Mao and it was in the Mao and for this transgression, was put to the force for seven years.
Tibet of the Tibet can be inable, but the spirit of the population is from keeping present.
And then it all gets to the whole one choice.
We want to live in the world's world of the world's world or we want to get the policy world policy world of diversity?
The great antiantibodies in Margaret Mead, before he said that his greatest fear was that in our own fear view of the world, not only see the entire legal legal of the human imagination of the human imagination of the thinking, but a day we get from a sleeping midnarring from a dimentnarring from a dimentnarrupt sleeping possibility.
And it's hummiliating that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neoliter's revolution has given us agriculture, which has done us to the seminal culation of the seed-up culture, resmote the proper of the cler's specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern world industrialized has 300 years old.
That sharks the story is not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with in the millennia.
When these cultures of the world cultures are asked what it to be human, they respond to be human, they respond to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that all of us are going to be what we are. We are, a kind of aware of the possibility that all the populations and all the gives can be the given people and all the gives can fire. And there are great times.
I took this picture of the northern East Electure, when I went to the Huncelines with Inuit, and this man, Olaya, he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather's grandfather's grandgrandfather's loud to his grandfather's loud to the northern Electure.
The government government has not always been gentlemen with the Inuit and in the '50s to be able to be our earlier in the 1950s, we have given them in colonies.
The grandfather of this man refused to go to the way.
The family, teming for his life, and he took all the arms, and all of his attemps.
You have to know that the Inuit doesn't temes the cold --
The slectures were made of the origin were made of fishing in the skin in caribs.
The grandfather of this man did not put it in the night of the art or the bylizartical that is suffering in the notion of this man has not been swing.
It's sunched, and it is swarm the panancepantalong, and defected in their hand. When I made them are congelated, their hands.
It has salive on the point, the site of this keknife and when they were solid -- killed a song.

We want to talk about horse? [Risthe] And that, in different ways, [Applausi] And that, in different ways, is the symbol of the Inuit and all the people in the world.
In the aprise 1999 government canadec redded to the Inuit the total control of an therefore California and Texas I put together.
It's their new pathe. It's called Nunavut.
It's a territory or independent. They know all the minerary resources.
One of the unplendic example of how a nation-state can reconcide with his people.
And, finally, I think it's pretty obvious to who of us was in these areas of the planet, I realized that there are no act.
For somebody is home.
They represents of the human imagination of the human imagination that they get to the time. And for all of these kids, like the dreams of our children, they become part of our children, they become part of the hope.
For finally, we have National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never come to nothing.
We believe that the polemicy --
[Applausious is not persuasive, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best institution, to tell stories in the world. Every month, 35 million visites.

Our magazines are reading millions of people.
Our work is traveling in ethnosphers' places to bring our public and cultural and cultural and cultural delivers from which they have seen -- they will hope they have to be able to be the central revealing in diversity, and we have to find a nice of the anti-world world plurist world and multicultural multicultural world and multicultural multicultural multicultural and multicultural multicultural multicultural world to be able to get to get to the deep.
where the wisdom of all the populations can contributing to our benefits of collective wells.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some of the things that I wrote in this book that I hope to call some other than other than you have heard and try to reach some links in case not borders.
I would like to start with what I call "the officiale."
Can official dog?
The official dog's official society and the dog's official official and the "If we want to get the benefits of our cities."
The reason is a motion of the fact that freedom is in itself a value, is precy, useful for human beings.
On the other is the fact that if we are free, each of us can do everything that masses our benefit to do everything that masses our benefit without any deciding in the name of ourselves.
The way to masses the freedom is to be massize.
More choices people are free, and more and more and greater is their freedom, more hor is their well-being.
This is a reporting -- it's so deeply deeply in society that nobody would dream to put it in the doubt.
And it's also deeply deeply in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big.
I lost a simple note on conditional conditional condition for insalate conditional conditional conditional conditional condition for insalate for ins.
In my supermarket is 175 conditions, without containing the 10 varieties of extraverage olive and the 12 bits of oil and 12 ballossamic numbers in the skie of conditional constance that nobody of your 175 undaries is your gradiphic than your 175 ready to be your gradiment.
That's what the supermarket is.
And then you go to the electronic shore to buy a stereo: CD, radio, radio, CD, radio, radio, plast, amplificator.
And in this single election of electronic electronic components --
We can do six million and a half different combinations using the components that there are in one negoties.
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Other field world of communications.
One, when I was a kid, you could get all the wishes phones, to the pat that they were forming from mom mamma Bell.
He was known the phone, I didn't buy it.
A consequence of that, in the way, was that the phone is that the phone is not a make.
These times are gone.
We have a almost illimitate of telephone cell phone cell phone cell phones --
Here is the future.
My favorite is that in the middle, reader, MP3, cuts of the nose of the nose crash --
If you don't even see in the sheet under house, you're pretty much certain that will be to get to get to it.
And what happens is that people in the negod is that people in the negod and this question and the answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too many things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than water, you think the same explosion of choices.
There is healthcare -- not happening in the United States that you go to the doctor and the doctor of what you can do.
Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor, and you can do A, or B" "He's got these benefits and risks." "By these benefits and risky."
You say, "Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. -- what should I do with this?"
And the doctor says, "A has these benefits and these riskes, and Be's got these benefits and these risk."
"What do you want to do about this?"
And you say, "Dr. if she was me, what to do you do to do this?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not leight."
The result we call the "mala," expression of the malato," expression that makes it look like a good thing.
But it is actually not a shift the fish, and the responsibility of making decisions by somebody who knows something, which is a doctor, to someone else who knows -- and so it's not not in the ideal condition, and so not in the ideal condition.
There is a huge market of drugic product drugic product people like me and you, if you think it doesn't make a sense, that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, why do we have their public icize?
The answer is that they want to do in the doctor to ask ourselves to change the receptace.
And that is how much fundamental as our edentity is a question of choice, as you see in this vignite. We don't want to be a kid children. They don't want to be a identity." We don't don't find more identity."
And we can reinventing how many times we can get aggrade aggrade.
That means that every morning -- to the risky, you have to decide that kind of person want to be.
And in the family, and a mall of the family, a time perspective, united to anybody who was married to anybody can be able to do the most preme possible, and it was going to get the most preme possible.
The only real choice was with chemicals that I don't don't even what to do later.
And it's really going to play with.
I think I smart to students, and I do their 20 percent of work than a time.
And because they're not less brilliant because they're less diligent.
but why I'm implemented to ask yourself, "Could I marries or no?
"Would I have to marries late? I think before the kids or the career or to career or the career or the career or to meet the career?
They're interrogatives of now.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implement, even if this implement, and not get a good vote to my exame.
And they really have to ask it. They're very important.
Now, the job: we're lucky, like Carl subtolineavy, because technology allows us to work every day, from every day, from every day, from the Hotel Randolph.
And in the parenti, there's a corner, and I don't tell anyone who who doesn't say any one of the WiFi works.
I don't say that because I want to use it.
What is this incredible freedodoming of choice that we have about working on the work? Is it to keep all the time.
We can go to see our son play, with the cell phone in a take, the Blackberry in the wint, and the notebook, typically on the knee.
And even if they're all thumpy, every minute that we see our kid rovince -- we're also asked, "Do I have to answer this call?"
"Do I have to answer this email? I have to email?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of your son game, very different than what would be in other conditions.
So, from any partners, we think, little big, things and things -- things -- life is a question of choice.
Of the world was this: Ovo, there were some possibilities, but it was a choice.
The world today looks like this: The dilemma is it is, "Is it a positive thing, or negative thing, or negative about?"
The answer is the answer is the same thing.
The positive lights we all know -- so I'm going to talk about the negative ones that are the negative lies.
All this choice bees two negative effects on people.
The first is that the sassumment, is that it produces paralalyside.
With many options between the reports, which is very difficult to do it.
I give you a significant example of a meaning -- a study conducted pension: a fluntary of volunteer pensions.
A connect of my connection to the Vanguard, the gigantescide of the deep deep with about a million clients, with about a million clients in 2,000 companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offery more, the percentage of adedescscenes of the 24 percent.
With 50 sources, there's 10 percent of the deaths of additional advertissus when they're available only 5. Why?
Because with 50 founds of them who choices, it's very hard to decide and choice is remains to the questions.
And I still wonder, and I still wondered, questions, and of course, the questions, and of course, the questions don't get to it.
You know that not just means that these old workers are going to be food because they don't have enough money, to say that decision is so that they also lost the decision is so that they also lose the fundamental founds of the work.
Not participating them all all the way to 5,000 dollars per year from the dator of the dator of the data, which would be good displace.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally, for ethnize, for lab, "ketchup, senape or main?"
You would like to take the right decision if it's for ethernity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong fund to the wrong and you don't want to choose the wrong with it.
So this is the first effect. The second thing is that even though we can avoid paralyside, we are less satisfacfacfacts of how we would be been with less options between less options between the unitself that you choose to what they choose to the parallies.
And this for several reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions between the which is that if you buy one and not perfect, it's easy to imagine you could have have to do a different choice that would be better than it would be better than you can have been better than the imagined imagined us to reach the choice, and the rempire refashion of the decision of the decision of the decision that decision of the decision that you would have to do a little bit of the decision --
even when it was a good decision.
More choices are easier to do it as much as you have to any detail than any detail of option.
And in fact, there's what economists call it cost-opportunity cost-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has closed very well to stamattine that we give to the things to the things that we compare with that we compare it.
And I said, when you have a lot of options possible is easy to represent the alternative characteristic of the alternative respectate and being less soddismissed in the option of the option that you have choice.
Here's one example. I took me with all the people who are not in New York.
But that's what you probably think probably about it.
There's this copy of Hamptons.
A place of the susch.
Spipes plendid. It's all about them.
Not anything. But what he thinks he is, "Well, maledies, Agostod."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan is something."
"I could be parked to your home."
And he spend two weeks that it was losing -- every day -- the chance of parking -- every day -- the chance of parking where you want.
The constant opportunity is decreasing for what we have, even when choice was exciting for what we have, even when choice was excellent.
And the most of the options we have to be considering -- more the characteristics will return us to be a way against opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
It talking about the time and maybe of the living and perhaps of the living moment.
But the most important point is that anything you choices, you can get to not to do others.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of attractive attractive what we do.
Third point: The spiral growing of expectations.
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans.
To jeans.
Once the jeans were just a little bit of a little bestish, they were swimming them a life and worked out a lot of times, they were smoke to go right.
So, I went to buy a couple of new jeans, when the old game -- and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cut."
The committed said, "You want to fit, fit, folks relaxed me -- relaxed it --
Do you want to do cernier or with the bottonies? "Stonehed" or "acid."
"Do you want to do it as a lot of it?"
"Can you want to be a bunch or close?
I was smart, and after a little bit of a little bit -- which was the only one guy who was the only one guy who was the only one guy who was so now to get all the malean 'th-the-the-the-jeans, then I went to the negoti, with the best jeans that I had ever had I had ever had.
It was the massive one. With all that I had got the better.
But I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worse that I was worse with all that choice were altising, the jeans had to be perfect.
At the beginning I had expectations to me. I didn't expect to nothing exceptional when it was only one typical -- but when it was about 100 different type, at a guy had to be perfect.
What I had watched was good, but not perfect.
After having paragoned to what I was trying to be inherent to the expect to the expect for the expectations.
The adding of options in the life of the people don't make it to increase the expect that these are respected to the options of the options of the options of the options itself.
And this will produce less soddisfabulation, even when the results are good --
No in the marketing world if it makes it content.
Because if you know what I'm talking about.
The truth looks more like this.
"You were better when it was worse the reason that was better when you were worse to be worse is that when you were worse to meet with the surprised evolution.
Over the world we live -- opulent inary industrialized citizens with the expectation of perection -- the maximum that we can hope is that things are on the height of the expectations of expectations --
You'll never surprised because your expectations -- because your expectations, my expectations, and they have ingigantite.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is "Bases" "Yeah, you want to me."
I mean -- little bit of a authorified -- which are really married and my wife is really stumble.
I couldn't do better, I didn't have to do a little bit of account.
But it doesn't always have a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of buy a couple of jeans comfortable when you have only that kind of jeans is that when you're not satisfacfacts, and ask you "What?"
"Who's responsible -- the answer is clear
The world is responsible. What could I do about it?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insoddisface, and you ask you who is responsible for the responsible responsible responsible for you are you.
You could have have to do better.
With hundreds of varieties available variety of units for the insuccess.
So when people get decisions, even if the result is valive, they feel insecuted and they give the hit itself and give the hit itself.
In the last depression is exploded in the industrialize.
I think a meaning -- not the unique, but important -- of this hondipressure is that people have deludent experiences because standards are too high.
And when they have to explain this situation they think that the hit is them.
So the final result is that we are better, objectively but we feel worse.
Let me tell you about it.
This is the official dogmake, what we all take for good and it's not true.
There is no doubt that a little choice is better than that doesn't have to have to have to have a lot of choice is better than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of choice is better than a little bit of a little choice is better than a little bit of a little choice is better than a little bit of
There's a critical value value of critical value.
But I'm sure we have overcome to a piece of the level that the choice improving our life.
Now, from political point of view, I have almost finally -- from the political point of view, the nurge, the core is the follow.
What it allows all this choice in the industrial society is the material wealth is material.
There are many places in the world, and you know what the problem is not that they have too many choice.
The problem is they have too much of it.
So the faccenda facturing is a malasive of moderns, rich society that we are in the modernal society.
And what it makes you depress and angry is this: Steve Levitt talked about how much those constant and sat at at seats seats are useful. It's a money.
I mean that these choices, complicated and dispendious, it's not that they're just useless.
I'm just deleterious in the weather.
They are worse.
If a little bit of what in our societies has so much choice was reverse in those where people have too much possibility, it would not be only life to improve it.
This is what economists call a paretian improvement improvement improve.
A redistribution. A re-re-re-re-re-re-distribution.
And to conclude, "From it, you can become all what you want,
Voo, people of culture, think about it -- "What do that fish?"
"It's obvious that you can't do anything in a mouse of vetrow wetrote w."
"A picture castrated, a limited view of the world's ...
and I was also interpreted it so on.
But then, I realized that that that fish, I realized that that that fishes the long knows the long time.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you send the mouse of the mouth, so that "everything is possible," you can't get the liberty. You get the paralyside.
If you break the mouth in a way that all of you can decrease the satisfation.
You get to get the paralymming and you get the benefit to be.
Everybody needs a sphere.
This is almost certainly too closed, maybe even fish, maybe for fish, and because of us for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic spherce, teme, for the rovine of a nice symbolic symbolic sphery.
Thank you very much.
