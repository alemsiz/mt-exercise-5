Last year, I showed these slide to show that the art calote, which is about three million years has had the artical heat, which for almost three million years has had the size of the United States of the United States of the continents,
But this subvalue of the problem because it doesn't show the pace of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the pace of the problem because it doesn't show the pace of the problem because it doesn't show the pace of the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice of the problem because it
The art active acid system, is in a way, the clear heart of global climate system.
It expanding and return it into the summer.
The next slide is going to be a quick fast on the last 25 years.
The sea glacious shelter are signed in red.
As you see, they expand they expand it up to the Europe
That's the ice in the winter that reports of the summer.
You can see that the so-called the so-called five years or more, is like blood here is like blood here from the body.
In 25 years has been from like this.
This is a problem because the heat the very concern of the ice around the ocean artic ocean around the artic ocean that you have huge carbon on as you have huge carbon on -- they turn into the meters from the microbibis.
And in the total pollution, global warming from global warming, that amount could double to the amount of double that doesn't return.
In some deep Lagenhes the metan is already reboiling from the water.
The professorse Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was based on a team low-last last Lake lake lake slow.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: Wow! The question is if we are going to be us.
A reason is that this exchange termic warming the Greenland, the northern from the north.
This is a river.
The laughed never had reached level.
This is the Kangerlussuaq, in the Southwest of the Groenlllland,
If you want to know how the sea level sea level of the sea ice of the sea level of the sea.
These currents are increasingly increasing rapidly.
Antarctica, the largest block of the planet.
The scientists have delighted that the ice of the ice is in negative, and that Antarcticket Antarcticket on some submarine islands on the submarines, is particularly fast in the sheet.
Equival in six feet of waterfabulous water, like the Groenllland,
On the Himalaya, the third largest block of ice, you see new laghi, and a few years ago were glaciers.
The world's population received half percent of the world's pounds.
South Andelle Ande: this glacier is the source of the water water water in this city.
The brought up is increased.
But when it decrecreased it itself happening to the water.
In California nevada Nevada is 40 percent.
The hydrodrogen are in crisis.
The predictions as you have read, they're grave.
The growing sea sea world that has a remarkable increased increases of pregnants.
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and without previous precedents.
Four times the most numbers of the last 30 years than the previous 75.
This is a whole whole thing that is a sustainable to be unsustainable to be unsustainable.
If you look in the history of the history of the history of the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons, in CO2 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the area of the East, the area of the East Americe, and both parts of the subcontinent India, where there is a radical subcontinent, where there is an impoor of oxygen in the oceans.
The greatest cause of global warming, together deforestation, which is the use of the deforestation, which is use of fossil fuel.
On oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions, together at China.
And he was proposing to build a lot of other central central to a lot of other carbon cents.
But we're looking at a direction of direction.
These are the annulled projects in the last few years and some evidence of green alternative green proposition.
Each way, there's a lot-political in our country.
The carbon industries and oil has 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon clean carbon clean up the carbon clean up with oxymore.
That image reminds me somehow --
Very Natale, in Tennessee, where I live, there was a loss of 3.8 billion gallons of carbon dioxide of carbon diox.
Maybe you have seen it on the argue news.
This is the second largest flow of America.
It happened around Natal.
The natalization of one of the carbon industries was this.
Video: The coal coal is a coal kind of a fallegry and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and clean.
It's a good price, adorable workers are maintaining the jobs are maintains.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of the West is going to be the West of West Virginia.
The largest minerary society on the mountains Massey Coal. This is the Masse's greatest society.
Don Bland, Don Bland, I'll be clear -- I'm going to be clear -- Gore, Nancy Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clima Proteon has launched two campaigns.
This is a bone of it, a part.
Video: Ate: ALergi: At COALergist see climate changes as a night of our business.
So in this first one in our priority is to invest the money, in a commercial effort to make public and confuses the carbon truth of carbon.
In fact, the carbon is not spore.
We think it's clean -- has a good profume.
So not predictable to climate change.
Let me do it.
Video: A: Cood: Can I guess -- you heard a lot.
So let's do a turn around in a framing structure to have a very structure of the coal coal coal coal coal.
Straordinary! The machines are a little wheels -- but that's the sound of the clean technology
The carbon consumption is between the main causes of global warming, but the remarkable technology that you can change everything.
You look at a look at the issue of the carbon technology of the clean fuel of carbon technology.
Al Gore: Infinally, the positive alternative alternative to economic issues and the national safety of the national safety and the national safety is the network.
Video: Same is crisi; America, it's crisi; the national security economics.
The file that lines all the lines of the fuel fuels: our employees like the sports and oil oil oil oil and import.
Now, so, there's a new new solution for users uscircles.
Rear America: 100 percent of clean energy, in 10 years.
A plan to re-put America to work, make us safe to work, make us sure safe global warming.
Finally, a solution that you basts to solve our problems.
Finally, America. Scover more.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: Comment: It's about returing energy in America.
One of the fastest ways of fast ways to end up the dependence that kill our planet.
Comparsa: The future is here. You know, a new energy network.
It takes a number 2: Nuovi investments for jobs to work well well retribe.
Commandment: Rear America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old proverbio African proverbio African saying, "If you want to go speed by itself.
If you want to go far together."
We have to go far fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED I did a little introduction on the LHC.
And I promises of back to how the machine.
So here I am here I come. And for those that the other time is not the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment, ever trip -- 27 miles of circumstance.
Her job is to reach the conditions that were present less than a billionth of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
All of this is just the environment.
This is the car under Gineven.
We do these min-Big Bang in the relevel.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's a 44 meters and has a diameteter diameter.
This is an ATLATLAT image in building so you can see the proportions.
The 10 sect section we have the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immense immense in control.
It's a picture of the first of particles of particles that had all the LHC, coming in in collision, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spread particles inside the relevel.
In other words, when we saw that image the 10 secember, we realize that the car working, which is a great live.
I don't know that was this to do it explode more than that, when somebody went on Google and saw that the beginning, was this.
That means we had a culture of the scientific impact on the scientific impact on the scientific impact on the scientific impact beyond scientific impact on the scientific impact beyond scientific impact on the scientific impact of the scientific impact on the scientific impact of the scientific impact on the beyond scientific impact beyond in the scientific impact of the scientific impact in the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact to the scientific impact of the
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, had to these sleep-sleep-sleep-sleep-sleep-sleeped files -- these sleep-wipped files -- these sleep-dor-side-on files here -- these saving rounded.
These files are 13,000 amps -- when the machine works when the machine works at the massive potential of power.
Now, technicians in you will look at the files and will say, "It's not true. I'm filming too subsidie."
And they can do it because when they're very fresh fresh becomes the superconducting films.
So, at least 271 degrees to a hell temperature to the space, these films can bring that current temperatures that current.
In one of the junctures in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the files will be a little bit of warming and 13,000 amps suddenly meant a electrical resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive, if you think that these magneters are about 20 tons, and that have been moved about 30 centimeters.
They were damaged about 50 magnetics.
We had to take them down.
We reverted them and fixed them.
Now they're going back all in their place in the ground.
I would be the end of the LHC is to be new integroups.
We want to accender, and we expect to get the data to fair or him, and we continue to find out what the morning is the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these crashes reaccending the debate on the values of science and engineering. It's easy to conf. It's easy to conf.
I think that the fact that it's so hard to go beyond the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I would like to conclude with the words of a scientist, Humphrey Davy, where, I guess in the defense of the experiments of his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, Michael Faray, said, "No is so dangerous for progress of the human mind of the progress of the human mind is that there are no new worlds in nature, which there are no new worlds in the conquise, that there are no new monies of conquiste for progress to conquiry to conquenty with the world."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about how kids, you play in the morning.
You know, you realize how to achieve them, take them and make them and move and get them and get them to do it and solve problems, and you know, solve relationships.
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us.
So, from an informatist inspired by our interaction with physical objects, with my consultants, and my collaborator, and my collaborator Jeventually, I started asking myself, "And when I use a computer computer -- instead of having the mouse of the mouse as a computer -- to have the digital polymp that has moved to a desktop and we could affect information with ents,
and to our pleasure our pleasure that to?
The question was so interesting that was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable is a big computer as a cookie.
In a few words, a Siftable is a big computer as a cookie.
You can move them with hand, they can see their movement between them, and they feel their movement and they have a screen and a wireless radio wireless radio wireless radio wireless radio wireless --
But most rate, they're physical, are physical objects like the morning, you can just move it to the switch it out.
The Sifty is the example of a new ecosystem to manipulate information to digital information
And as they become safe safe you know about the movement, others, and as they become more physicists, and as they become safe safe and other different kinds of how we die them, we can explore new and different fun stil.
I'll start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show some vide: if you cut it in a direction, the video so that if they including it in the other side back.
These interactive ratives are aware of others.
If they are interested in what they are interested in what they around them.
If they look at the circuble, they see it and they can get a little bit.
If they look at the circuble, they see it and they can get a little bit.
They also have their movement and clines.
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the common data, to say, "Look a liquid color as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as a green bucky bucket and I can use them to be mixed.
and I can use them to the color of the color in the middle of the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of
We can reach some of it, we can put a little bit of the place.
There are also nice possibility of learning -- like languages, the mathematics and joks where people can try to do things quickly and see the results of the things and see the results of the results and see the results of it.
Now I'm --
This is a Redwood sequence of Fibonaces that I do with a current program.
Here we have a game of words that is in the Scarabeo and Boggle.
Only, every turnd, every turns, you get a letter to every Siftle, Prrically, every turnns, you get a letter to be literal in Siftable, and while you try to make words about a dictionary dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds of the remissing, and you have a new set of reading and new set to try it.
Thank you.
And that's what the children came to the Middle Media Lab, I made them and I did a video video video.
They are very much please.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give you a lot of educational things that are going to be educational things.
You just have to just say, "Compons of word," and they know exactly what to do.
That's what other people who try it.
This is our younger head.
It really wanted to be used to take them.
They were only in the morning, for him.
Now, this is an interactive applation of a interactive cardboard.
We wanted to build a tool, to learning about the learning of the Lui Hui is Felix.
It can be able to put new characters in the scene, satislying the Sifty and they can reach them associated with it.
It can be able to put new characters in the scene, satislying the Sifty and they can reach them associated with it.
So, it's going to get the sun.
Video: The sun is surgence.
David Merrill: Now he has taken a treatment in the scene.
Video: The arancient treat.
Bel job. Yes! Yes!
So schooling the Siftable and put it close can make the characters --
Video: Bau!

Video: Hi, Hi, o!
DM: It's a story with open final final final final final final final.
DM: It's a story with open final final final final final final final.
Video: Golden gato;
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, realizing it's a tool, made recently re-sampling and execution.
is a tool, made recently recently realizing that we have been doing music.
The Sifty here act sounds like lower, low-down, and bacteria
Each of these has four different variations, and you can choose what to use.
You can also put these sounds in a sequence that you can pleasure these sound.
And you just modifice it just by making a sound."
These are actually actually actually actually the reverberation and the filter and the filter filter.
You attack it to a particular sound and then including it to address it.
And then there are the general effects as long and volume, which is applying the whole sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
DM: We will try to put a basic base, we go to a basic base, we get into a serious basis. We add it in a series, the extend of the base.
Now I put a band a low-line.
DM: DM: Now I add percent of the ...
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the bacteria, so I can control the actual effect of the live.
DM: I can speak the whole sequence with a time by a side or the other.
DM: And I'm going to add the bottom to the lower to give the lower to give the more expression.
DM: I can recombine the sequence "voles."
So I don't have to planning it before, but I can sudden, make it longer or more correctly.
And now, finally, I can smoke the whole sequence by the Siftable to the Siftable volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces more similarly like our brains and more similarly like our brain.
And today, I've had time to show you one of the results of this lost and also some possibilities that we try to take out the lab out of the lab that we try to bring out the lab out of the lab that I think is going to be able to take out of the lab that cord, and also some possibilities outside the lab out of the lab that I think is going to try to take out of the lab that cord, and also some possibilities out of
The concept I want to transmitting is that new generation of objects designed to interact with digital media with digital media media in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a writer.
From books is my professional extra is more than that, of course,
It's also love and the folding of my life.
And I don't expect to change.
But, said that, something that was recently successful in my life and my career, who has led me to rericalibrate with this work.
The particular thing is that I recently recently wrote this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Prega, Ama," which, differently from my previous books, for some reason that you used in the world and became a great sense, sensitive.
And the result is that everywhere you go to now, people treat me like you convicted it.
It's true -- convicted convicted a!
They all come from me to all the concerned and they say, "You can't afraid anymore?
You don't keep keep going to keep write for all life without being able to create a book that can care to do a book that can care to do a book that can care to do that?"
that can care to somebody?"
It's rassicurant, you know.
But it could go worse to that I remember that over 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer.
I met the same reaction based on the fear.
And people were told me, "You can't have success to you succeed?
You don't have fear that humiliation kill?
You don't fear to do this mestock for all life without anything you come up and die on a heart of saming bags with the mouth of saming with the mouth of loving clay?"
So, you know, you know,
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is "Yeah, y."
I fear of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I have a fear of many other things that people can't guy.
As the heavy and other things very frightened things.
But, as it was about writing what I thought and ask me the mind?
Is it rational?
It's logical that anybody should be waiting for being frightened by a job that you feel born to do it.
But what's so particularly in the creative impremise creative to make us nervous, in a way that other careers don't fan?
As my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he was afraid to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to do you know, what if he was asked if he was asked if he was a little bit about the activity of the activit
It was never -- that block of engineer John, how is it does?
It didn't work.
Onestly, chemical engineers like group didn't have certainly in the several column reputation of being alcolized.
We writers -- we have enough this reput, and not only writers but creatives of any genere, we have this reputation of being enormously instabmentally.
And it is not going to look at the sad content of the magnification of the magnificent creative than only in the twentieth century, they die young people and often to them.
And the ones that are not suicide seem to be disappeared by their women's dones.
Norman Mailer, before in the last interview, he said, "Of my book has killed me a little bit more than -- a little bit more, which is a little bit more, in the work of their life.
But not drink when we heard this because we have heard this so long as we heard these things that so long that somehow we completely expensive interiored and accepting the notion are somehow you get and art, finally, will always be in the front of the art, and then will will always be in angosheld: will always be in the range of the way we have all interior and accepting the notion is somehow you have completely ive
And the question I want to ask everyone to today is you agree with this idea?
And it's good for you to do this -- because it also looks at a hundred distance to me not good for anything about this support.
I think it's hated.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuate next century.
I think it's better to encourage our big minds to live.
And certainly I know that, in my case -- in my situation would be very dangerous to start out that the dark of supposing the constantly assume that I have in the circumstances that I'm in my career.
Obbt -- I mean, I'm pretty young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely that anything I write about now and then it's going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the last book.
He will be sucking, because we're all over here -- it's likely to be my greatest successful shoulder.
Oh, Gesus who think!
You know, this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start bing in the nine morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would keep doing this work that I do.
So, the question of the god, what be?
And so I always always always suits, after a reflective way to work to keep write is to create a psychological cooked psychological cooking costruck costruck or a perspective, right?
I have to find some way to find a security distance between me, which I am writing the natural conversation about what reaction that will be able model. And I tried for all last year models on how I started looking through time, trying to find other societies to see if they could have the best ideas and more healthy healthy ideas and healthy healthy ideas and healthy healthy ideas and more healthcare distance.
how to help people creative to deal with the inerents emotional risks of creativity.
And that research me led me to the Greee and ancient Rome and ancient Rome and ancient Rome.
Seguitemes because the yard, and then back back.
In ancient Grece and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity is from men in man.
It thought that creativity was this spirit look at the degree and that came to men from a few distant surprising and unknown and unknown away.
The Greew called these demonishing dives, the several dives.
Socry, wonderful, wonderful, believed that it has a demone that elves wisdom to be far away.
The Romorrow were the same idea, but called that spirit without a genius
which is great, because Romory, because Romors, they didn't really think that a genius was a genius in the middle of the gultim.
They believed that a genius was this kind of divin the wine of the study of a artist, a little like the elf, a little bit like the elfo Dobby, and that came out of the artical work on the artic's work and modeling the outcome of that work.
Ecceptional -- there is the distance of which I talk -- that construct psychological that protects you from the results of your work.
And everybody knew that was what it worked, right?
So the anti-ones were protts from certain things, like the too narcis; like the too narcis; right?
If your work was exceptional you couldn't get all the people to get the whole thing that they all knew that I was helped by this genius.
If your work failed fail, it was not all your whole be, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable to be a kind of unable to be a kind of unable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a kind of skill.
And so people who would have the creativity in the Ocker for a long time.
And then the Rindition came and all of the whole change, and we put the human being at the center of the universe over the center of the universe over all the mysteries and without having the space of the creatures that write details from divinity.
This was the principle of humanis: rational human rational and people started thinking that creativity from the idivid:
And for the first time in history, he started to referiring this or artist as a pretty pretty pretty much a person with a genius to a person.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think that allow somebody to believe that a simple person to believe that being a recipient as the source and the surpriers and the surpriers of all the mysteries is a responsibility responsibility is a responsibility for a nice responsibility to fragile the fragile of human beings.
It's like to ask somebody to ingoid the sun.
Deform and distores completely the ego and creates all these ingestiable ingestiant ingestive in performance.
And I think it was this pressure to have destroyed artists in the past 500 years.
And if that's true, and I think it is, the question becoming for, and there?
Can we do it different?
Maybe you go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery creative mystery to a more ancient understanding of the most ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery creative understanding of human relationships.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cut 500 years of rational thinking about rational thinking in a 18 minutes.
And there is probably in the audience that would be able to suspects of scientific suspects on the notion of the notion -- you make people come up with their own own on their projects.
I probably won't convinced you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to ask is -- why not?
Why don't you think that this way?
Because it has more sense of anything that I've ever heard to explain the exasperants of creative process.
A process that as anybody who has ever tried to do something -- so, basically, all here -- you don't have rationally rationally all here -- you know, it's not rational.
And, in fact, it can sometimes seem completely paranormal.
I did this recent recent with the extraordinary poet Ruth Stone, who has now 90 years, but it was a little poetc. And he said that during his childhood in the rural Virginia, worked out in the field, and he felt inside the fields and feel it inside of the landscape from the landscape of that, when a poetry came from landscape.
He said that it was like a fragorous fragory.
And that was rolling to break up to her landscape.
He felt it came to be because he was going to get the land under his feet.
He knew it was to have one thing to do to that point and it was saying, "Wating."
And so it was going to the house and it was followed by this poetry, and he wouldn't make a piece of paper and a match of paper -- and a match of the paper -- collecting it and grab it on the page.
Other time he couldn't be quite fast and running out of it, so it corrects and running without getting to the house and the poetry her and the poetry through the landscape and he would continued to roll through the landscape and he would go through the landscape and then you go through the landscape and he said, "another poet."
And then there were times -- this piece I don't forget that -- there were moments where it was almost los; right?
So, he was running at the house and he was trying to paper and the past was going through the pathy and he was a match in the while he was passing, and then he was like to flow with the other hand the step off.
He was the poetry from the tail and reduced it in his body and turned it to his body and turned it on the page.
And in these cases, the poetry would be on the perfect page and intact but the contrary word to the last word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word for the first word for the first word to the first word for the first word to the first one.
So when I felt thought -- it's crazy to my creative process.
I don't all my creative process, it's not a conduct!
I'm a mule, and my way to work is this; wake up to the same orary every day and go and go on and go over the enjoy and go on and go over the enjoy of the same time and go away.
But even me, in my head, in my head, I stood against that thing, at the time.
And I guess many of you have been done.
You know, even if the work work and ideas came from a certain source of a certain source I couldn't honestly know.
And what is this thing is?
And how can we relate to us to do not lose your head, but plutoster, ple, what do you do with it?
For me, the best example of me to that, the best contemporary example that I have is the musician musician in different years ago for a day.
We were talking about that, and you know, Tom, for the most life of life was the artical artist in the artist tormented contemporary artical -- trying to control these species of creatives of totally interiory.
But then he swarming, and he was driving on a day while she was driving on a Los Angeles, changed all for him.
He was going fast, and all of a very much of this little bit of this melodia, which comes in his head of how inspiring inspiration, elusive, and the wish -- you know, it's wonderful, and the wish -- you know, it's wonderful, and the will, but it doesn't know how to take it.
It has no piece of card, has no math has a math of card, has no recorder.
So he starts to feel this kind of old anxiety to him "los" to lose and remark obsessed with this persemsembled song with this persemble.
I can't do it and I can't do it."
And instead of going to the panic stopped --
And he did the whole process and did something completely new one.
He just looked at the sky and said, "Hey, I'm not seeing that I'm driving?"
"Do you seem to write a song nove?
If you really want to exist, it in a little bit more opporting when I can take me care of you.
Other triment, you go to to a little bit of a today;
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his work process changed after this.
Not the job, the work even as a semble bley of the job.
But the process, and the heavy that was released when the genius was released when the genius that he used to do anything that I would have to be in the problems and remaintaining it back. And he was coming back.
but it was going to be a conversation a conversation between Tom collaboration in Tom and this strange thing that he was not Tomom.
So how much that story that I was going to change a little bit the way I worked and already rescued me a time.
This idea, I was saved when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Amak," and fall in one of the disperation where we all come up with something and we can't start thinking about something and we can't start thinking that it's going to think it's going to be a disaster, which is never written the worst book I would never write.
Not only bad at the worst book written at the worst book --
And I started thinking about throwing this project.
But then I reminded me from the air and try it.
So I raised my face in the mandished and I would say my comments to a corner.
And I said, "Look, "Look, what, you know, if this book is not going to be brilliant not going to be bright now, right?
Because as you see what I'm going to ho, I have no longer than that.
So if you want it to be better and do your side.
Okay, but if you don't do that, you know, I don't do anything.
I'm going to go to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to favor that was a recorded today that I was to do my part -- because -- finally, it's like that, you know, it's in the North Africa in the North Africa people were raduned for the dance of the North Africa -- people were dances of the walk of the walk and hours to the dawn and the dawn to the dawn and the dawn to the dawn and the albe.
And they were always magnificent because the dances were professionals and were fantastic.
But every while, rarally, something happens, and one of these artists became actually transendent to it.
And I know what I talk about, because I know that you all seen it in a certain point, a lost the case.
It was like the time he walk up and the dances walk through a kind of portal, and he was not making anything differently from the sun, like 1,000 nights -- but all you hit up.
And suddenly it seems to be not just like a human --
But it turned into the divince and delight-minded in the fighting of divinity.
And when this happens, the time that they were known to the days, people knew what he was -- they called him with his name.
They had the hands and started singing, "Allah, Allah, God God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
That's God, you know,
Curious Nice historic -- when the More invaser the Spain the South Spain, were this habits and the ready to change in the centuries from "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah,
In Spana, when a artist has done something impossible and magic -- "Allah, ooh, ooh, you know, the magnificent -- uncompreprehensible, excepting God.
And it's great, because we needed it.
But, the problem comes the next day later, for the baller: when you wake up and discovers that are 11 o'clock in the morning of Marted: there's no more.
It's just a mortal with a big dead to the knees, and maybe never will never be able to that height.
And maybe no one will be the name of God still while the yet, and so does it have to do the rest of his live?
It's hard.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to do in a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angoscious if you can not believe that, in fact, that the most extraordinary thing of your being come from you yourself.
But it crew that you have been given by a imaginable imaginable source of this team of your life that you have got.
And, you know, if we think that in this whole change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's certainly like I thought for different months during the work of the book that audience that I would do prestahead, the dangerous afterwards, the dangerous following of my great.
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel elecripped from this is, not having fear.
Not just fall in your work.
He keeps to your side, any of your side, any of it.
If your work is dance, bally.
If the divine, assurd, I assigned you to let me get some kind of wonder, for a few kind of wonders, for a moment through your effort,
Other triments, you do the same as your dance.
And "Oh, y!" to yourself in the same.
I think I think it's got to teach it.
"Yes!" to yourself." And even for the human being, and tests talks to you all the talks to you continue to make you continue to be constantly presented the human beings.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Oh, it's on!
As you know, I've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome on what can meaning and the discovery of new genes.
We're starting a new percorsound: we started digitalize biology and now starting from that digital code we are entering a new fashion biology of biology, designing and sympting life.
We always tried to ask for a big questions.
"What is the living?" is something that a lot of biologists I guess to levels.
We tried different approaches, reducing the minimes of the way, and we have a little bit of a different approach.
We're digitalizing by almost 20 years now.
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to past the analog world of the digital world of the digital world of the computer.
Now we ask ourselves, can we regenerate life, or create new life from this digital universe from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from genome between what small is the genome of the smaller between what that can authorities.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a even smaller than that.
We can eliminate a hundred genes of the genes of the genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the metabolic map to his metabolic map to the noad's map on the nostr.
Belilize, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate -- it's very unlikely that this can bring a living cell.
So we decided that the only way to make the progression was to synthize this chromosome, so we could exhit the components to bring some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the adventure of the "Can we can synthesize a chromoso?"
Can chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never did do the creating before you?
And, in a deal in a clever chromosound?
A chromosome, it's just a piece of chemical material.
The speed that we can digitalize life is growing up exponential is growing at exponential rely exponential of the rate that we can type the life is growing at the exponential of life is growing at a range of life is growing at a very exponential of it.
Our ability to write the genetic code, aging the genetic code, aging progression and better.
And our most recent results are exponential curve.
We started over 15 years ago.
The process, he requires a lot of past -- starting with a bioetic revision before we started the first experiments.
But we found that DNA is very hardly is very hard.
There are tens of thousands of the world that produce little segments, the mountaining of 30 to 50 letters and is a degenerative proces: the most selection is longer, more errors.
So we had to develop a new method, to correcting these fragments and regger the errors.
And this was our first attempted to go from digital information of the genome of Phi X 174.
It's a little virus that kills bacteria kills back.
We designed the fragments, effective reption of the errors and get a molecules of about 5,000 letter --
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical materials and we put it in the bacteria started reading this genetic code and put it on the bacteria particles and producing the particles of the virals.
The virals have been released by cells, are coming back and they destroy Es.
I talked about recent with the petrolife's the petrolife's saying that their own model.
They have a little bit more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the biggest things in large.
We wanted to build the entire bacteria chromosome.
They're over 580 miles in the genetic code.
So we thought about building it in the size of the viruses of viruses so that we can change the cassette to understand what the components of a living cell.
The design is crucial and if we start with digital information in a computer, these must be very accurate computers.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the standard accurate was a mistake for every 10 mile --
We found out that resequencing it out, 30 errors. If we had that original sequence we never had been able to do it.
A part of the process is designing long reading 50 letters that are overwhelmed with all the other segments of 50 letters to build smaller subunits that work together.
We try to try to be one of the ones here.
You probably have a little bit of the lap we put the right-grade.
Think of this is: we have a genetic code based on four letters: A, C, G, and T.
Three of those letters together codifice about 20 amminoids, and there's a specific order of reading for every love of reading for every love of reading for every love --
So we can use the genetic code to write words, thought, fraying, thinking.
What we did at the beginning was authographing.
Some were dolphin were dolphin from the fact that it was not poetry.
We designed these chords to just unimagazines with encies.
There are enzymes that are reparate and put them together.
And we started assembling the parts, starting with seven miles from five to seven miles liters, to unitself, a letter unites to their time to be able to do 72 letters.
One, we have produced these subjects in abundance so that we can see in a very highly proceeding procement that we're trying to create a very highly robute -- as you see in a minute.
We're trying to automatizing the process.
So, this seems the tabellon a basket of a basket et et et et et et et et et et of baskets.
When we get these very long, more than 100 miles ahead directly in the E.
You get the limite of the modern tools of the molecular biology.
So we looked at some other mechanics.
We knew about another mechanism called a homology recombination of homology, which is useful repair to reparate DNA in unique to reparate DNA in unize.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiation.
You can see in the upper distructure, like his chromosome, you can see in the upper upper upper upper distruce.
In 12 -- 24 hours are reassembled exactly how it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that have been able to do this.
These organisms can be completely.
They can live under a vacuum.
I'm absolutely sure life exists in space, and you get to the new rich environments.
NASA showed the NASA showed that this happens.
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes -- just using the light-appropriate with the design of the design of the chunk of inseries.
The lievidence that I assembed automatically.
This picture was not taken with a electron microscope, but with a regular microscope.
It's a molecule so great that we can see it with a slightly slightly slightly microscope.
These are pictures that cover a period of six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago.
They're over 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of a defined structure of the defined structure of the human structure that ever created by man.
It has a molecular weight molecular heavy 300 million people.
If we spent it with a 10 without space, it would like 142 pages to just turn this this genetic code.
Now, how do we work work? How can we activate it?
Of course, you get a virus is a game by kids.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria it.
It's simpler even when it's a clonelonest-cells as our own -- you can just extract the nucleus and put another one other, which is basically the clone.
In the archaea chromosome, the chromosome, but we recently demonstrated into the cell of a cell trapiant of a cell chromosome from a cell and active cell to another and active it.
We clean a a chromosome, in a very different special species.
The two are different as men from the topis.
We added some genes in the way we can decide what to do for this chromosom --
The one has then brought into the enzymes so that they kill all proteins.
And when we put it in the cell was stupending -- and you will open our graph -- the new chromosome, the new chromosome, went inside the cell.
And we were thinking that we couldn't go to it down to the way, but we tried to push it over there.
This is one of the greatest mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third chromosome, I add in a second thousands of new tracks to that species.
So who think about evolution as a gene gene to evolution that is not a lot of the biology.
There are enzymes called the restripes of restripes that even digest.
The chromosome, it was in the cell of the cell of the cell is not one.
The cell phon-the chromosomes we put in --
It expressed, and he recognized the other chromosome, and we found it with only the cells and the new cell with only the cellula and the new chromosom --
It became blue to the genes that we have inserted up.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a species have gone lost went out of the whole new software that in a species, based on the new software that we put in in the cell.
All the proteins have changed it, membranes have changed and when we read the genetic code balance.
Now, this may seem to genetic alchemia but altering the software DNA and you can change things in a pretty substantial way.
Now, I explained that there is not about genesis -- but of progress from three million and a half million years and a half million years of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion process.
Why do I that?
I think it's obvious when we think about our needs.
We're going to be for six and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946; 40 years, there will be four years of it.
We're going to find out the problems that we find food, fresh and clean, medicines for six and a half billion people.
It will be even harder to do it for nine billions.
We use more than five billion of carbon -- over 30 billion of olium barrels of oil --
That means a hundred million barrels a day.
When we try to find biological processes that are going to replace them to replace them to be a huge challenge of it.
And we have to hold all the CO2 from these materials that ends up in the atmosphere.
And the day of today, because of the scientific discoveries around the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the design components for the future.
The electronic industry has only a dozen of components, and think about how many different things have came out.
Our limits here are principlely biological and our imagination.
We have now some techniques to these rapids of synthesizing, able meetods of creating what we call a combinatory combinatory what we call a combinatory methods of the technique.
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day.
Think of process, these 20 million genes of different genes or try to get the processes to produce either eight or pharmaceuts, new vaccines, we can change through a little team, and create more molecular biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard selection selection.
We can choose to survive -- chemistry or carbon vaccines etc.
This is a instant-software some software programmed that we're working in order to be able to sit and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't necessarily know how they do.
We know exactly what their genetic code.
Now we're focusing on the carbon on on carbon on on the carbon on on carbon on on the carbon on on carbon on on deal.
You also saw you who extract ethanol from the free was a male experiment.
We have carbons in second and third generation that will be going to be soon from higher sugar as as the eight or different kinds of smoke.
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increasing increasing the impact without increasing the cost of food and limiting the degree will be transforming the cells that can achieve this purpose, and we think we can get this purpose in the middle of fourth generation in about 18 months.
The sunlight combined with the CO2 is a methodo; in our discoveries around the world, we found different methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep ocean to about 2,500 feet temperature of the water.
It creates metane from the CO2 molecular hydrogen molecular hydrogen source as source source source source.
We're trying to figure out whether we can put the CO2 -- which can easily be transported by tubes, converting that CO2 in the carbon in the carbon in the carbon in the middle of the way that you can get this process.
So short we think that we could be able to increase what the basic question "What is the life," it is Noi, truly -- we have the modest of replace the whole industrie.
Actually, if you can't do it from TED, where you can't?
It would become a main function of energy.
And the other thing is we're working on to use the same methods to create the instantaneous methods to create the instantaneous methods to create the same methods to create the same methods to create the instants.
You saw this year with influence, we're always behind a year and with a dollar in less when it comes to find the right vaccine.
I think that what you can change it in a combinable vaccines in antibodies in antibodies in a anticipate in a anticipate of the variable of the combinable vaccines in antiboundaries.
And that's how the future could start to look like changing, now, the tree of evolution, accelerating evolution with sympts, archaaeucarian cells, archaaeuos.
We're so so much from improving people.
Our purpose is to do a way of living enough to try and make a fair. Thank you very much.
I will show you the most rapidly possible to see the most rapidly possible jobs, the new technology that we took the Microsoft to a almost a year ago to a pretty good year ago -- that's Seadragon.
It's a environmental environment, where you can interact is at the local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data.
Here we're seeing a lot of gigabytes of digital zoom with a kind of expensive zoom and continue, for a speechamic speaker, which is available images as we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information we see, how big the amount of information we see, how big these data collects or images.
Most of them are digital photographs, but this is a scannotion from the Biuly of Congress, and rewalk in the legal of Congress, and rewing in the legal of Congress,
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the predicts the predicts a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any moment. It's also a very flexible architecture --
This is a whole book of an inter, example of data doesn't imagine.
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens. Every colonna represents a capitule.
To show you that it's just about testing and not images, we can do something like that, to see that it's a real representation of a representation of the head, not a phototo the picture.
It may be a little artificial book.
Don't you advice.
This is a more realistic example of a number of the Guardian ardian unc.
Every picture is the beginning of a selection.
And it gives you the pleasure and the beauty experience of reading the heart version of a magazine or a daily of a neighborhood or a while.
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of the Guardian un--looking looking in the angle of the Guardian un.
We created a higher advertising in high resolution -- much more highly than what you use in a normal commercial advertis; and we put in the content content content.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific technique.
And this really shows some of these ideas to helimining the limits space on the screen space.
We hope that this means to put in a few pop-up to the pop-up and other porches, not should be reverted to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And on this one of this I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have contributed to the field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. guns above a geospace of NASA.
So now we're going to go to something else.
This is actually living on the webs; you can go to see it.
It's a project called Photosynthize, which fought two different technology.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting computer visual computer computer that Noah Snavely, a student of Washington, with the help of Steve Steve Seitz of the US and of the Washingtelii Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft Research. A collaboration. A collaboration. A collaboration. He collaboration. A collaboration.
And it's living on the web, running from Seadrage in the web,
You can see it when we do this kind of screen that you can go from one picture and have this kind of experience to be a picture of the other kind of experiences.
But the space collection of the images has actually a meaning.
The computer visualization of computer visualization has recorded these images together, so that corresponding to the real places where you imagine -- all sorts -- all close to the Huhi Grassi on Mountains on Montagne Roccious Montagne Roccious Montagree Roccies -- you see the elements of a bread de-show show show show -- and these things are all connected to space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environments.
There are a lot more space.
I want to spend the same way to one of Noah's original data, and this comes from a previous prototyping Photosynthize -- to show you what I think is the first time last summer, to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology, Photosynthize, Photosynth -- and it's not necessarily much obvious to the environments that we put in the environment.
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of Notre-Cathedral of Notre Dame images from Flickr. Bastdigital in Notre Dame in Flickr and you get images of the camps, other of the camps, and so on that it represents a picture that has been discovered to this model.
So they're all connected images from Flickr and have been all connected to space, in this way.
And you can get to this simple way.
You know, I would never have thought of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very free to get this kind of acvast here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of different pictures of the pictures to those SLR, a number meaningful number of phones in this environment.
And if I can go out and try and look at those more strange things.
A lot of them are blocking, etc.
Something here is a series of photographs -- execcold.
This is a poster poster in Notret Dame recorded right right now.
We can go from the poster view of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now taking data from everyone -- from the collective interviewing with the whole collective memory of how the earth, from the view, from the view, from the visual point of visual visual memory -- and all of those data together.
All those photos become connected together, greater than the summer than the sides.
You have a model of the land of the entire emerge.
Think about this as a promotion of Stephen Lawler on the Earth.
It's something that growing in complexity as people use, and that people are use, and which is the advantages are increasing with use.
Their photos are marked with metaminated by other people.
If you get the idea of the boundaries all these things saying, my picture of the Cath-From Dame suddenly resaving all those data, and I can use it as a point of ingres-to go into that space, in that metapuniverse, and having a picture of anybody and have a social experience of a cross-moil from the cross-moil from the red-s-mote and red-se-wiring experience of the cross-mode cattin-mode cattin-s-like experienced me-grade cut of the whole belrangle of the whole of these dat
Of course, a consequence of all of this are interesting models of all interesting models of the interesting part of the earth, collective only views, and the satellite images and satellite images and sible, but by collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized good? What your software will have to do is that at a certain point, in the next few years, all the pictures that they are in the world will be basically connected together?
BAA: Yeah. What is basically doing is fine.
He's creating hyperlink, if you want to be a imagine.
And it's doing it in the content of the imagines.
The thing is very interesting if you think about the wealth of the semantic information that many of these images are going on.
As you do a research for images on the Web, you know, a phrase and the text page is about the imagery of phototo the image imagery of photos.
Now, what if that picture comes to all your picture?
So the amount of seed-up interconnection and the amount of wealth that is really enormous is really a classical classical effect. It's a classical classical effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the main pleasure when you travel and one of the innographic research is the fact that you can live in who has not forget the antic of the traditions, between those who had the past, in the stones in the waving stones in the flowing and plants.
You know, the monkeys think that Jaguar travel even beyond the Milky Way, or the Inuit is still a sense of meaning -- or that in Himalaya, the buddistes still the releases the real spiry, to remember the importance of the Dharm of the world's anti-old Womail -- and the idea that the world in which we live in a sense of reality, but it's just a model of reality, and it's just a model of reality, and it's just a model of reality, and it of reality, and in the idea of reality, and the idea of reality, and the idea of reality, and the idea of reality, and in the idea
the consequence of a particular set of adaptive consequence that our stirpe has done, good or multiple generations ago.
And, of course, we all share some of the essential tracts.
We all nice. We all procreate.
We are subject to the beginning.
We have to deal with the inexorability of death, so we don't surprise if we hang --
We all have an art.
What it is the most of the canny rhythm of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Penan forests of Borneo, or the following of Haiti, or the warrights of the desert Kaiseseven-Sepentrierries of the Wildans, or a ield camellow in the Saa.
He was my company in the desert a month month ago, or a month of ya-and-halling in Qolang, the mother of Everest, the mother of the world.
All of these populations teach us that there are other ways of thinking, other ways of moving in the world.
And if you reflect a moment, it's a concept that can give you.
Inside, the miriades of the world creating a spiritual life and cultural life that goes the planet and cultural life that goes on the planet and it's important for the well-being of the planet as the ragned biosphish.
And you can think about this raise as a cultural as a fhere and you can define the ethnoxifies the sum of all the conceptions, ideas, inspirations, ideas, inspirations, ideas, inspirations, intuitions that are from the imagination of the the height-up imagination of the the awareness.
The ethnos-hetnow-world of humanity.
It's the symbol of what we and what we can be in as a kind of inquisitive.
And because biosphere has been very consumed as much as it was very quickly consumed in the ethnos;
No biologist, for example, it would say that 50 percent of all the species is on the bear the bedroom, because it's failed or -- in the heavy of biological diversity, in biological diversity, and not close to the most optimistic diversity, the most optimistic diversity, that the most culral diversity -- that the culral diversity -- that the culture of cultural diversity -- that the most culral diversity is --
The indicates of all of that is, of course, loss in language.
When you're born 6,000 languages on this planet.
A language is not only compost from a vocabulary rules.
A language is the explot of human spirit is the existing of human spirit.
It's the middle of the animal in the animation of every culture is in the material.
Each language is a forest of mind, a swise, a spiritual possibility of spiritual possibilities.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we sit in Monterey, at least half is not more surrying in the ears of the child in the ears of the child in the ears of the child in the ears of the child is not more sushed in Monterey, at least half of the time is not more suspect in Monterey, at least half is not more sushed in Montery.
They don't get to the kids, the wheat, which means less you get something, which is already died.
What is there is more than you're going to be the last talk of the last talk to a language to talk a language of not having the wisdom of address or anticipate the promise of the daughters?
This is a flowed in a few parts of the world every two weeks -- every two weeks a old hours die with the last silly -- the last syllables of an ancient language.
And I know that some of you will say "Isn't that much better?
The world would not be a better place if we were all the same languages?" Benism, then we all yoruba. Let's talk about a meeting one-month.
Let's talk about kogis.
You will will find a little bit of a thing that means we can't talk about their language.
I would like to do a journey through the ethnosferap through the ethnos;
a little journey in the ethnos-fast to give you a assume of what we're lost.
A lot of us forget that when I say, "different ways of existing existing ways of existing to existing ways of exists.
We take for example, this Barasana, in Sepony Sepony Sepentrione, the popular anananaconda, creating the military of the law's rivers of the lawood of the sacries.
It's a popular population that is not able to distinguishing the green color because the celeste is identified in the forest, which depends the population.
They have a strange language to and a marriage rule -- "exogamics called ""Hoogamia you can see a person who talks a different language.
All of that has radicals in the past-grade has the particular arity is that in these extremely extent families where you talk about six or seven languages of the unlike a language of any any any any any any of the nobody is a language.
They are limited to listen and then start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived -- the Waorani Ecuador nordr nordoral, an incredible popular that has had the first contacts in 1958.
In 1957 mission had tried to be a facing error.
They made them out of the photographs that would take them in the pose that they thought of friendly delivered that this population of rainforest that this population of raining forward.
They collected the photos from the ground, they were looking for a form or a shape and not finding nowhere, they hadn't been killed that he was the diavole, and they killed the mixes with the lances.
But the Waorans didn't have to kill the straniera.
They kill themselves in them.
Fifty percent of the mortality was caused by their own themselves.
We are remarkable to eight generations and we found two of natural more, and when we put it up to say, they admitted that one of them was so that he died in aging -- and then they kill the same, and then they kill him and then they kill him a incredible knowledge.
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the first 1980s, I was assigned a really interesting job when my Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to intrufolding between the secret of Duves: Counvaliver and Tonton Macoes, and Tonton Macoes, and impoison, and I could be the velended up to do the welended up with the veleness to Haiti in the first use of the veleration of Duvesing of the Guvesselection of the veleny of the pri
To make sense of my miraculous myth I would have to understand the Voodoo culture and that Voodoo is not black may.
It's quite a metaphor complex.
Very interesting --
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world, what would say?
Christian: Islam, Buddho, Ebraism, etc.
A continent is always left out, thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious faiths. And instead of the Voodoo is the distilled of these very profound religious conceptions of were very profound born during the back.
What makes interesting is the voice is the intense of life and death.
So you have to have the spirits.
The spirits can be invocated by the Grande Aqua, they answer the rande and temporary replacements of the dance and temporary replacements the following of the following becomes the following becomes the following becomes the dium.
So the voodooisters like "You go to a white to talk about God.
We give us in the temple and become God."
And from the moment you can seduce you, is the spirit that you drive the sick of mal?
So you look at these incredible events. I followed the voice in the state of tracking time-infuel.
And in all the populations that I lived the most extraordinary of Sierra Nevada Santa Marcket Santa Marcket Santa March Colombia sect sectors.
The tyrent of the ancient civilization that once they were living on the careers of the Colombia in attesa conquist, the population of the conquiry massive conquiry that would be the erge of carbolombic plane that is on carbaid plan.
In a drug continent in a blood continents, this population has never been conquiry by the spages.
And in the sudden is a class of a clack and their trained is decides.
The young people following their own families are being taken by the family to three or four years, and live in a world of dark and shadow in the baths of the ice for 18 years.
Two periods of nine years that I had to reproduce the nine months of management that spend the user:
For all of this time, they have accultured to the values of their companies, values that they predate and only their prayers are maintaining the cosmic balance -- or to say the ecologic balance.
And the end of this incredible initiation, they suddenly have been brought and for the first time in 18 years, see a heel. And in that activity of the first batch of the first bat, when the sunsunny sunsun valles of the beautiful beautous pathy -- all of his talk is all his splende. The prey is a past of the backwards and says, "Have a past comes back and saying,
"Right? I just give you a detail.
It's amazing. Now it's going to protect it."
They call the greatest brothers and say that us, brothers are the destruction of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think about indegence populations and invote Rousseau and the old story of the wild history of the noble history of the noble history of the nowl or maybe invote Thoreau and say, these populations are closest the Earth of us.
The people are not feeling or not feeling or no indebolited by our algia.
There's no space for these things in Asmout of the Asmat the gelides of Tibet, but because of the time and ritors, they created a mystic of Earth not on the concept of being conscious consciously neighborhood -- the concept that the Earth is the concept that the Earth can live because it's only unsupppped by consciousness of human consciousness --
What does that mean?
That means that a girl of the Ande that grows to believe that the mountain is a spirit Apu that will leave his destiny is going to be a deeper and will have a pretty different relationship with the mountain or that place to a Montana or that place in Montana growing girls in Montana growing that growing is a fun of the mountain is a shadot of rock to be in the scary of the Middle World War.
which is the dimore of a spirit or a little bit of a mineral death.
What is interesting is the metaphor that define is the relationship between individual and natural world.
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica believing that the forests were going to be cut.
That made me a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are didyed of Hukukukuk and the beak spirits and the beekeeths that live in the world northern the world that live north the Hamatsa.
If you start to think that these cultures can create different reality, you can actually start to understand some sense.
I took this picture of opening up this picture of opening the western Amazony.
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuase, the most powerful repertoive of the repertoium.
What makes the ayahuas's an ayahuas's not the potential for support, but its processing. It's composed by two elements.
From a lian unknock that has a series of beta-carbolin-carbolin-harmine and molinogene.
And I take the only plant plant has a fire fixed that alters a little bit of consciousness, but it's measured with the leaves of a coffee arbumed by the coffee was Psychotridis.
This is a plant powerful powerful powerful guys in serotonin, and methoxyptamine-5, methoxyptamine-5, methoxyptamine-5, methoxyptamine-5, methoxyptamine-5, methoxyptamine-5, methoxyptamine-5, methoxthoxyptamine-fithoxthoxixmethoxyptamine-fies
If you ever see the Yanomami tyrare on the nose of the replacing set of species, so it has methoxyptamined methoxyptamines.
Tirdating that pole is a little bit like being disappeared by a fire descate of boards' painting and landing on a sea of electricity. It doesn't create a distortion of reality.
I was often descrating with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who flowed the psycheap, with his discovery of the halling hallens in the 190s in the 1930s.
And my text can not be classifying these triamines as if you're done in the intestines because if you're don’t tell anyone to be hallucinated. But they can't be hallucine-the-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-toxidaygen in the intestined of the world,
It's possible assule at the earth only if you put other chemicals that dening the MAO.
Now, the beautiful carbolen: the coal betols that are in this book: the same kind of need for the MAO, the same kind of necessary for potential to potentiate triptamines of plants, how these people are doing -- how these people are they going to find two deathologists -- how these people find in this way, they believe in this way, a biochemical version that is sum to the sum of the part?
We use the great eufemisism of proof of proof of the proof infruttly.
But if we ask India, they will tell us "Plants are going to tell us "Does speak."
What does that mean?
This tribe, Cofan, has 17 variety of the ayahuase, which distinguished nely in the forest, and our eyes would reach into the same species.
If we ask how they stabilize their pockets, they will tell us "Thought to be plants, of the rest I don't know every?" I said, "No."
The solution is this: you take the 17 variety in a night of a full mountaining with a different tone.
With this not Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to count the stames.
Now, [applausiases the problem is that also the ones of us who have to heart people are painting them in the margen but somewhere in the margen history of our real world and pass it to be beyond the marine world to be beyond the bringing world to bear them.
In fact, the Xth century, 300 years, it's not going to remind for his wars or its technological innovations -- but rather like the age that we stopped and we have embracing the destruction of biological and the planet. Now the problem of biological and cultural innovation of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All culture through the hundreds have been involved in a dance for new life to the possibility of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians have no way to be smart to be Sioux when they put away away from the ark and free fresh as Americans have no being in Americans when they put away away from the horse and hot calculations.
It's not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of the ethnosfer. It's the power.
The last fly of the domination.
And if you give a look at the world, you'll find that these are not destined cultures are not rights.
They are living creatures and dynamic forces out of existence from existence to identiftable.

If we move on the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research, where I'm doing a lot of research, you see the harbor the harmful of political domination.
As you can know the genocide, the physical extinction of a popular popular level, but the destruction of a popular popular popular destruction of a popular popular popular -- not only is not convice, but celebrated in certs, because it makes a part of development.
And you can't understand the suffering,
I have the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China in China in China in China in the Western with a young colleague, and I realized what I realized the statistics is behind the statistics that we feel about it.
6,000 sacred money.
1.2 million people killed by military military during the Cultural Revolution.
The father of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama.
which means that it has been killed at the time of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of the Chinese invades.

Tibet can be insecus -- but the spirit of the population is from teners.
At the end, it all comes to a choice:
We want to live in the world of the monotic world of the world of the world world of the different policy?
The great antibodies Margaret Mead, before we die said that his greatest fear was that, in our way to this worldview, we don't only see the range of the world -- not only will see the range of human imagination in the thinking, but a day we wake up from a dimention of thinking, but a day we are going to be other possibilities.
And it's humiliating to remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolition, Neolition, which has given us the agriculture, which has made us socked us to the cult of the seed-prose seed-proof-cler-clerated gerarchia of specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrialized world has to be 300 years.
That squallida is not suggests me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with the millennia.
When to these world mirighty mirighty miright-what it wants to be human, they answer with 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all risk the possibility of being what we are. We are, a kind of aware of that, that has to make all the people and all the garden and all the garden moments. And there are great moments.
I took this picture of the northern the north of Baffin, when I went to the whales of Baffin, and this man, Olaya, he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather's grandfather's talk.
The government canadedese was not always gentlemen with the Inuit and in the 1950s to our unce, we have hininhink them in colonies.
The grandfather's grandfather's degree going to go down.
The family for his life, he brought all the arms, and all of his attempts --
You must know that the Inuit doesn't temt the cold ard.
The slylittin origin were made of the weight of the weight of the slabels.
The grandfather's grandfather's not intimit by the art night or the byyard that was suffick.

They represents of human imagination that reach the dawn of the time. And for us everybody, the dreams of these kids, like our dreams, becoming part of our children -- they become part of hope.
And finally, we have National Geographic is convinced that politicians will never come to nothing.
We believe that the polemicy --

Thank you.
I'll talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope to call the other you already heard and I'll try to represent some links in the case you don't notice them.
I want to start with what I call "the official dog."
The office?
The official dog's officer of all the Western industrial societies. The dogma official of all of our citizens."
The reason is is a state, in the fact that freedom is in itself a value, is useful, useful, useful, essential for humans.
On the other is the fact that if we are free, each of us can do everything that male our benefit to do everything that male without no one that decide in the name of ourselves.
The way to massizing freedom is to be massize.
The more choices people are more are free, and greater is their freedom, more hours is their well-being.
This is so deeply deeply rooted in society that nobody would have dream to put it in a doubt in the society that you would have to put it in a doubt in the society that nobody would have dream to add it in a doubt of society.
And it's also deeply deeply in our lives.
I'll show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
This is my supermarket is not particularly big one.
I lost a simple note on condition for insales.
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions, without contempate the 10 variety of extracting the 175 whale balloon oil and the 12 balloon the grounds in the scious circumstances that no one of your 175 reads is of your gradize is to your grade of your degree of your degree olid.
This is what the supermarket et et et et it.
And then you go to the elect of electronic to buy a stere: CD, radio, plast, radio, plast, the leg.
And in this single store, there's a big audio of electronic components is a big number of audio.
We can do six and a half million combinations using the components that are in one negotis;
We need to admit that there is a lot of choices.
Other ther field: the world of communications.
Once I was a child that was a child could get all the services that were willing to be mothers, to the phone serves from mama Bell.
He was known the phone, I didn't buy it.
A consequence of that, in the other, was that the phone is that the phone is not a made.
These times, are gone in the story.
Now, we have a variety of telephone, especially between cellular cellular cellular cellular cellular phones --
So here's the phones of the future.
My favorite is the one in the middle, reader MP3, cut of the birth of the nose and foreign for the brule.
If you don't have seen it in the store, you're pretty much certain that soon will come there.
And what the end is that people enter in the stores and ask this question. And you know what the answer is? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too many things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water, you really do the same explosion of choices.
Butter: There's no health happening in the United States that you go from doctors and the doctors what you have to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor, and he says, "Okay, "B.'" "B." "B, you know, has these swewebenefits and risky."
And he says, "Doctor, what should I do?"
And the doctor, "A wishes and these risks, and Bs these risky."
"What you want to do in it?"
And you rebit, "What's the one of me, what would do?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not lei."
The result of the "mala," expression authonomy that makes it look like a good thing.
But in fact, it's not a fishing and the responsibility for decisions to make decisions from somebody who knows something, which is the doctor, to somebody else who knows anybody knows -- and therefore not -- and therefore conditions, the patient patient.
There's a huge marketing of drugs, direct people like me and you, if you think about it, you know, you have no sense, a sense, because you can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, because they are public puzzling them.
The answer is that they want to doctor's doctor, to ask the doctor,
What's that fundamental identity is a question of a choice, as you see in this vigo, "We don't want to force the child to be a child in the right moment. We don't want to be a little bit of identity; we have to invent.
And we can reinvente how many times us there.
which means that every morning, you have to decide that kind of person you want to be to be a little bit of person to be.
And it was in the family and marriage a time the perspective perspective has almost to anybody, it was that he married us the most soon as possible, and he started to make the most soon as possible.
The only true choice was with while, not when, and even what to do later.
It's really going to play it.
I think of very smart to students, and I do 20 percent in less of work than a time.
And not because they're less diligent because they're less diligent.
but why I'm implements, I mean to ask ourselves, "Whouldn't I marries me or no? I should do it now?"
"Could I have to think about later? I have to think before the kids or care?"
They're a logiant interrogatives here.
And they try to answer these questions, even though this implements not completing the companies that I asseger and not get a good vote to my exame.
And they really have to do this. They're really important questions.
Now, the job: we're lucky, like Carl subolineavy, because technology allows us to work every day, from every day, from the Hotel Randolineavph.
And in parents, there's a angle, and I'll not tell anyone where, where the WiFi works.
I don't say that, because I want to use me.
What means, this incredible freedom of choice we have about the job? It's that we have to continuously decide to work or not.
We can go to the toy play, with the cell phone in one pocket in one pockets, and the notebook, typically, on the knee.
And even if they're all sorts of the spent, every minute we see our son to rovince the part, we're also asking the question, "Did I answer this call?"
"I have to answer this email? I have to email? I have to be able to this liter?"
And even when the answer is "no," all of this makes the experience of your son was very different than what it would be in other conditions.
So, from any of the way, tiny and big objects, materials and big objects and stiles of life, is a question of choice:
Obten the world was this: Ovo, there were some possibilities, but it was not a question of choice.
The world today looks like this: The dilemma is the delemma is, "Is it a good thing, or negative?
The answer is Space.
The positive grade links we all know -- so I'm going to talk about the negative sides.
All this choice behaviors two actually two actually actually two negative effects on the people.
The first one, paradoxically, is that makes paralyside-of-free.
With many options between the finger and it becomes very hard to do it.
I give you an significant example of the volunte: a conducted example of volunteer: a volunteery conducted example of volunteer.
A colleagued access to the data of Vanguard, the giant data -- the giant society with about a million clients in the 2,000 different companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are going to more, the percentage of air.
With 50 sources of offeres, there's 10 percent in less than the deaths when they are available only 5. Why?
Because with 50 founds in which you choose to the choose -- it's very hard to decide and choice is remaintaining the questions.
And to ask questions, and still questions, questions, and of course, the questions, and of course, won't get there.
You know, not only mean that means that these old workers from old people to hold food for dogs because they won't have enough money, want to say that decision is so obsticking the complementary sources of the work.
Not participating, they're losing to 5,000 dollars for the dator of the dator of the dator of the data.
So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally, for ethietchup, "ketchup, sense, sense, or may?"
You would like to make the right decision, if it's for the eternity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong bottom and you don't want the wrong condition to the wrong condition to the wrong bottom wrong.
So that's the first effect. The second one is that if we can avoid paralyside, and make a choice, we are less satisfacts from the result of how we would be with less options between less options between which they choods.
And this for several reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions of the things that you choose and it's not perfect -- it's easy to imagine you could make a different choice that would be better choice that would be better than alternative imagined us to be better than the alternative imagined us and the rempiant relief. And what happens is that it reduces the decreased redisflighting from the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision
even when it was a good decision.
The more choices are easier to be so easy to any detail that is insibling of the option option option.
Also, there's what economists call cost-opportunity to call cost-opportunity to call cost-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has a very well stamattine as the valuable to things that we face.
Del remade, when there are so many options possible is easy to represent the features of the alternative features of the option and being less soddisciples of the option that you chose choice.
Here's an example. I have me all the ones that are not New York.
But that's what you would think you probably would think about it.
There's this copy to Hamptons.
A place of luxury place in the leap place.
Spiles in the spind. It's all for them.
It doesn't send anything. But what he thinks is "Well, maledition, it's Ago."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan is alive."
"I could parked right in front of home."
And it pass two weeks that were being losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where you want.
The expensive opportunity is decreased the reliation for what we have, even when the choice was excellent.
And the options we have to consider the most of the features that will come up against how expensive expensive opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
It talking about the right moment, and maybe the living and maybe the living living in the moment.
But the most important point is that anything you choose to you choose to not do the others.
The things that we don't choose is a lot of attracts what we do.
Third point: the spiral growing for expectations --
I tried it on my skin, buying a new couple of jeans.
Since almost always jeans.
Once jeans were one typed, they were buying and dress were bought and dress were sweeting, they were just after having them a life and work a lot of times, they were going to go good.
So, I went to buy a couple of new when the old man came out, and I said, "I've got a couple of jeans, this is my cut."
The committed to me, "You want slim fit, relaxed fit, relaxed it?"
You want to look for the Nermays? "Stonehed" or "acidd." And "aciddle me?
"Do you want the round?"
"You want to hold or strets? Ble -- he was he he called them elencars. He was he he brought to elencard.
I was stagged, and after a little bit of I could say, "I want the kind of -- which was the only one guy who was a little bit -- and he didn't have what I had a little bit of the spades, then I came out of the negoti, with the best couple of jeans that I had ever had.
It was the moud. With all that choice I had the better.
But I felt the worse of me.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was the worse is that with all that choice was that I had all the choice were expectations to be perfect.
I had expected minim. I didn't expect about any exceptional when there was only a guy but when there was one guy, there was a little bit of a little bit of a perfect thing.
What I had the acquaise, but not perfect one.
After I had a chose to what I tried I was insearch in confronted confronted in the waiting for expectancy.
The adding addition in the life of people don't make the expectations that have respect to the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the people who are respect the options of the options of the options of the people do not increasing the options that they have respects to be the added options that they have respect to be the excellent of the people to be the options of
And this will produce less soddisfabulous as it is good.
No one in the world of marketing is not a marketing of it.
Because if you know, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth looks more like this.
"It was better when it was worse when the worse was worse when it was worse is that when it was worse was that when it was worse to be able to meet the surprised of the premise please.
On the world that we live -- opulent industrialized citizens with the perfeature of perspective, the most of the perfeed -- the most of the expectations of the expectations of the expectations of waiting.
You never surprised for the expectations because your expectations -- my waiting, is ingiant -- they were ingigantite.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is "Basasasassumption."
I want to say -- little journthotic moment. And I really am married and my wife is really stumble.
I couldn't do better, I didn't have to do better, I don't have to do better.
But it is not always a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of buying a couple of jeans when there's only that jeans is that when you're not satisfact, and you ask you "Why?
"Who is responsible for the answer is clear.
The world is responsible. What I could I do that?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insoddisface, and you ask you the responsible for you -- is so clearly clear that you are responsible to you for your responsible for you to the responsible responsible for you to the responsible for you to it.
You could have to do better.
With hundreds of varieties available varieties are not excuses for the insuccess.
So when people make decisions, even if the result is valid, they feel insudden and give the hit and give the hit to their own own itself.
In the last last few years depression is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think a meaning that you -- not unique, but important -- of this hondrug -- of this hondden is that people have deludent experiences, because standards are too high.
And when they have to explain this situation they think that the hits to be them.
So the final result is that in general we are better, objectively, but we feel the worse apart.
Let me tell you about it.
This is the official dog; what we all get for good and it's completely failed. It's not true.
There's no doubt that a little choice is better than a little bit better than a little choice is better than a little choice of a little choice is better than a little bit.
There's a critical value value of critical. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we overcome from a piece of the level the level that the choices better.
Now, from political point of politician -- I have almost finally -- from the political point of view, the next is the following.
What it allows all this choice in industrial society is the material.
There are a lot of places in the world, and you know about it.
The problem is they have too few of it.
So the fact that I'm talking about is a mal-exclusive, is a mal-exclusive, rich societies.
And what it makes you depress and angry is this: Steve Levitt told you about what the expensive and sweats are useful. It's a waste of money. It's wastspreading of money. It's wastspreading of money.
I want to say that these choices, complicated and dispendious, it's not simply usely.
I'm even deleteries.
They make us worse the worse of it.
If a little bit of what in our societies societies would be reverted in those where people have too much possibilities, it would not only be their life to improve better.
This is what economists call a paretyan Mildy improvement.
A releasing releases everyone -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in the except -- because of this choice in the except that torments.
And to conclude is, "You can become all what you want,
You know, people in culture, they think, "What do that fish?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a vetrow."
"A fall-imagination vision of the worldview, a limited vision of the world."
and I was also interpreted that like that, in the beginning.
But then, I realized that that fish, I realized that that the fish.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you send the mouse of the fact that if you get the freedom.
If you break the mouse in the way that all you can be able to decrecrease.
Waccepting paralyes, and you get the well-being.
They all need a spher.
This is almost certainly too close to the fish, maybe weight, maybe even fish, and certainly for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic -- I fee, for the ruining of a lot of the sphere is a recipe for the infelrant.
Thank you very much.
