And last year I showed these slide for demonstrate that calculate glacial calculate that for almost three million years had been restreted.
This is a lot of this subvalues of the problem because it doesn't show it in the ice.
The glacial climb, is in a certain sense, the heart of the climate system.
You expands of inver, and they returned out of the expand.
The next next slide will be a floor, it will be a floors of the last 25 years.
The other environmental lots are signed in red red red red it.
You see, you know, you go to the blue sware in the blue screen.
That's the ice, the ice, which is the windrinked.
You can see that the cosident of five years ago, five years or more, is like the blood floor.
In 25 years is spent from this --
This is a problem because the Earth's interested in the ocean in the ocean -- where there are huge amount of carbon of carbon of carbon and floors -- they turn out to the microbic meters are mosts.
Remempt to the totality of the atmosphere.
In some of the deployees in Alaska little foot is already rebooks from water.
The professored Katey Walter of the University of Alaska has recated team a team in a team in the winds.
Video: Wow! Al Gor: She is well. The question is if we will be a hundred not.
A reason is that this scenes of the growth of the north.
This is a glacial regime glacial regime
The leveled was never reached levels.
This is the River, Kangerlusuaq, in the sound of the Groenland of the Groenland of the Groenland of the Groenlands.
If you want to know how the level of the level of the level of the level, here is where the mare.
These are are increasing increasing.
An the other part of the planet: Antarts, the bigger block of the planet.
The scientists have dichiared that the walking of the ice, and the balance, and that the Earts, and that the Antarts, which is particularly a little bit of the isole of a brows.
It is a six-simeters of water in the water of water, as in Groenland in Groenland in Groenl.
Himalaya, the bigger of the bigger block of ice, you see new side of the hot years ago were icai.
One 40 percent of the world was received half the point,
On And, this ice is the source of the water of this city.
The carried is increased.
But when he diminished, the same actors of the water point.
In California is about 40 percent.
The rips are in crisis.
The predictions, like you have a basic sket,
The growing security in the world door a remarkable autiful increases of incended incended in the world door a remarkable news.
The environmental disaster is increasing a room and without precedenting out of the normal and no precedent.
Four times more number in the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the previous 75.
This is a whole thing of instant.
If you look at the context of the story if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70-million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the top of the orient, the oriental Pacific America, and on the west, and on the subject parts of the continent of the continent in the oceans.
The most causes of global warming deforestation, together in deforestation, which is the use, is the usually use.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is lost of the oil is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries with the more emissions, together at Cina.
And it proposed to build a lot of other horrow of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of the carbon of the carbon
But we're seeing a change of direction.
These are the annulled in the last years, and some of the reverse of the green years.
All the way, there is a political lots.
The carbon and oil industries of oil have 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon and the carbon and the carbon and the carbon of the carbon and oxium in the last year year for a charbonds.
This image is a remind of something --
Nath Natal, in Tennesse, where I live was a 3.8 billion literal charbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of the Tennessee,
Maybe you saw him on the news.
This is the second largest floor,
It's happened around Natal.
The audiencity natalizes of a carbon industries was thy.
Video: Mr. Frosty the carbon is a kind of a balleum and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty carbon is more and more bigger clean.
It's a good price, lovely and the workers and the workers are hydrogen the stypending.
Al Gore: Da is a lot of the carbon of the West Virginia.
The bigger society in the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his friend.
Video: Don Bland Sarch, I'm going to be a -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelogic -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Allance for Proteon the Clim has launched two campaign.
This is a part of it, a party.
Video: All right, All right, let's see the climate changes as a minm of a minm of a minm of our business.
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a sformation to make public and confuses the real audience, and confuses the carbon of carbon the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the car
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it's a good -- it also has a good profum.
So not predictatevents of climate change.
Let me do now.
Video: Actually, you know, I heard -- you heard about a lot of talking about a lot of it.
So let's do a game of a framework in a structure of the carbon of the carbon the clean up.
Straordinary -- the carbon is a little room of the carbon technology of the carbon technology carbon the carbon of the carbon technology carbon technology.
The carbon is between the main the principal causes of global charbons of global charball of the carbon that you see change.
Do you have a charbon technology of carbon technology of carbon the clean hol.
Al Gore: Infinally, the positive alternative and the economic question and the economic security and the national security and the national security of the national security of the national issue.
Video: Here is in crisi; the economy, economy, the economy, the national security climate climate climate climate climate climate climate in climate climate climate climate of nations,
The move that college all the time.
Now, there's a new audience, there's a new audience.
Repower America, 100-house energy in diech dies.
They like to put the America, to work in the work, making sure -- and help the global scale of global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
Repower America. Scoprint.
Al Gore: This is the ultim.
Video: You know, it's about to America.
One of the faster of the faster dependence from the combustics that kills killing our planet.
Even talk: The future is here.
Even number 2: Novi investment investment for the jobs.
Ement: Reption: Reption, it's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old old old you you, "If you want to go to the speed -- you go to the fast, and you get from money to them.
If you want to go away to the move together."
We need to go away --
Thank you very much.
The year at TED phecech in the LHC.
And I promise to get to the machine.
So I gave it here. And for those who are not going to be the bigger experiment of the bigger experiment of the scientific experiment.
Her is to recognize the conditions that were less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second.
Everything is just environment.
This is the car below Gineva.
We photographing these mini-Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Bigh. .
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is a 44 feet and has a diameter of 22 feet of 22 feet --
This is a picture of ATLAs in the ATLAS in building so you can see the proportion of it.
The 10 sets of the scored year we accesption.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immense festate in the health health in the health health of control.
It's a picture of the first of the first particles that had done all of the LHC, sentencing in collision, with a part of the LHC, and difficult particles.
In other words, when we see that image 10 of the 10 10 september 10 settemployees, which is a great liftype that is a great liftremendous life.
I don't know if it was to do it extarch more op, when somebody went to Google and saw that the beginning was this thing.
That means we had a cultural impact of the scientific impact of what scientific impact.
About a week later, it was a problem with the machine, it had to these movies -- these movies -- these movies.
These mounds are 13,000 printing when the machine works at the massive powerful of power.
Now, the technical of you look at the movies and say, "It's not true. They're too under too much under there.
And they can do it because when they're very fast, they become the cosident cosident of the surface.
So, at less 271 degrees, a did, a hot inferior to that of spaces can bring that corrent.
In one of the most of the most of the most innovemila magnets in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the movies are surrisis to read forward, and 13,000 printed meeting a resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is more impressionate if you think these magnets are more than 20 tons in the tons -- and that came out of about 30 centimeters.
They're damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to get a touch of it, what we did.
We have repristinated and advanced.
Now they're now now now now in their place under place in the ground.
Entruthy the end of the LHC will be new integrated new integrated intes.
We acceptemate and ways, and we expect the data or he was a jug, and continue so our wind to discover whatever the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain the way, these accidents reacception, these accidents on the science and engineering of the engineering. It's easy to confuture.
I think that the fact that it is so difficult to go over the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the words of a scientist, Humphrey Davy, which is the imagine, in the inuses of inuseful experiments of his pullum was Michael Farad, he said, "No much dangerous is so dangerous as a dangerous science, "No much dangerous ideas that we don't have a remarkable science that our tries are completely instancestors, which is not a whole new new conctiontion.
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about here, by children, by children, you play cool matter to the morning.
While you understand how to realize them and realized them and move them and move them and move them and resolve them to think and solve them to think and solve the relationships.
The space is propattering is properly connected to the way that we understand part of the world around us.
So, from information information informed by our interaction with physics, and I was a consult of my consults, and my collaboratory collaboratory Kalanith, I started to ask myself as a computers, and he was a computer-information information as well-droom digital digital digital -- we could actually have a lot of information with a little bbital information with bottom.
and the system, it will be a food?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided we decided to exploring the answers.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a big discovered computer as a discovered.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a big discovered computer as a discovered.
You can move with the hands, they can move the hands, but they feel the motion and a skery and a floor, and a further wireless.
But the most of physics, as the battons, as the matton, you can move to be a remarkable to realize it.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of information information system,
And as they become more physics, consciously, of the other hand, of the other things, and as more physics, and as more physics, and the other other other things, like the other other people, as we can explore new and different tents and different tuns and different tuns of interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This is the Siftable is configurated video -- if you including it including video it in a direction, if I including the other part of the other part of the other part of the other parts in the other part of the other side of the other part of the other side of the video gund.
These interactive ritical ritritics.
If they are interesting them in the way.
If they come circumbs, and they can get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
If they come circumbs, and they can get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
They also also have their movement and inclination.
We then realized that one of the interesting of the interesting of the interaction was the power to use the data, as a color, "See a color, as if it was a boquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurates like a seck of the color, and I can use them to the color, where they missing them in the central centry, where they misse.
and I can use them to be to use them to the color, where they missing them in the central central and I can use them to be a mix.
If we can true, we can reput a little bit of a little bit of place.
These are also beautiful chance of apples, as the languages, the mathematics and games where people can try and see the things quickly, and see the things quickly, and see the resultype of the resultype of the immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonact of Fibonactic that I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a game of words that is in the Scarabeum and Boggle.
Pratically, to every turn in the Siftable, in every Siftable, Pratically, in every turns a literally received a letter in Siftable, and as you try to understand words of a ditionary.
Then, after about 30 seconds remissing a new set of lects, and you have a new chance to skill.
Thank you.
Here is the Media Lab, Media Lab, I did it in a video and I gave them and I gave a video.
They are a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of apply is that you don't have to give people a lot of education.
You just say, "He's ponones of words, and they know what to do.
Here's the other people who tries.
This is our most extest head, there is a deal.
It was actually wanted to impigs.
They just were basic basic for him.
Now, this is a apply apply apply apply apply.
We wanted to build a tool for the appreciate English is Felix.
It can inserve new personages in the scenes, sofect evating the Siftable to their associates.
It can inserve new personages in the scenes, sofect evating the Siftable to their associates.
So it's doing the sunch the sun.
Video: The sunging is sould.
David Merrill: He's brought a treat in the scene.
Video: The treatment is a basic treat.
Bel work!
So schooling Siftland and put them up closes can make the personages --
Video: Bau!
-- when I inventing the story.
Video: Cao!
DM: It's a final story with the open, and it can decide as you know.
DM: It's a final story with the open, and it can decide as you know.
Video: Video: I live it.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, realized to field and existed to exhibition, to existing music.
is a tool, realized recently, to exhibits, and exhibits.
The Siftable here is the basic like the basic and the bacteria.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what use.
You can get these sound these sound in a sequence of comport to your floor.
And it was just doing a touch of sound and a "sound "sequence."
These are effects that you can control of the movie.
And what a particular sound to a particular and then including to be true.
And then there are the general effects like time and volum, which is apply to the sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to put a base in two Siftless of "sequence," we system, the system, we bedrop up in a series, we add other base.
Now put a basic line.
Video: DM: One is to add the top of the percent.
Video: So I'm going to put the movie to the batteria, so I can control effect from living.
Video: DM: I know fast to figure out the whole sequence of time from a side or on the other side of the other side of the other side.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the movie to the based to the basic expression.
Video: DM: I can recombining the sequence of the flight to the flight of the flight of the flight of the sequence.
So I didn't have to planning it before, but I can suddenly make it more sentence.
And now, finally, I can see the whole sequence inclinking the whole sequence inclinking the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new man-machine is more more more more more than our brain and the brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the result of this percord, and also some possibly possibly that we try to bring out of the laboratory.
The concept I want to transmit is that is coming this new generation of objects to interact with the digital media and information in our world that leaves to information in our world that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the hour of talking to all of you.
They're a write screen.
Scare about books is my profession, but it's more than that, of course.
It's also love and the love and the fash.
And I didn't expect that can change me to change me to change me to change me that can change me to change me that I can't change me to change me that I can't change me to change me that can change me to change me.
But as I saw this particular is a recently successful in my life and my careera, that he took me to realibring me to the whole whole report with this work.
The particularly is I recently written this biography called "Mangia, Pra, Ama," the qualally, different from my previous -- for some reason for a big sense of the world and became a big sensational, bests, for a big sense of interaction, best,
And the result is that everywhere they were all the people treating me as if they were condent as well as if they were condent to me as well as if they were condence.
It is true -- condence, condence.
They are now all worried and says, "You don't have to be able to well as you could not be able to do better?
You don't have to write to write to write for all life could be able to create a book that can be able to create somebody that can important?
that can be to matter somebody els?"
It's rashyth, you know.
But it could go worse about the worse I remember 20 years ago, when I started to say -- I was a adolescent -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a write writing.
I met it to the same reaction of the same reaction of the country.
And people said, "Don't you have a time to be success?
You don't have to paury that the human human refurther than today?
You don't have to do this mester for all of life in the life without any of life that has never come out and die on a heart of a heart of skin with the eye of the flight of the enought?"
So you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "S."
I have a little bit of all these things.
I always had a pain.
And I also also have a lot of other things that people could not have to inate.
As the algas and other things --
But it was about about this is a write of what I thought I was a very close is because why why is?
Is it ration?
It's logical that anybody debate to be expect to be slowed by a job.
But what is a particular of that particular creative to make us nervous about the mind of the mind of the minds?
How my father for example, he was a engineer and I don't rememstriction and I don't remember a time in his 40 years of activity that was asked if it had been asking to be engineering capit?
It never was -- that it never -- that block John, like well as well as well as well as well as well as well on the engineering.
It didn't work.
Onestly, the engineering engineering group as group of the broken of being alcolized in the reputation of being alcolized maniacs.
We have a reputation, we have a reputation, and not just writers but creative growths of all generates of all the reputation of being huge to be enormous instable.
And it doesn't rest it is to look at the tristes of the diaths of the magnitude of the magnitude of the windition of the winds, and often to hand a lot of hand often hand.
And even the ones that don't have sound seemed to be really disappeared by their woms.
Norman Mailer, before I did, in the last interview said, "Or I killed a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a life extraordinary records.
But we don't have a lot of the way we heard about because we heard these things that in some way we completely interiorized and accepted the notion that the creativity and the environmental creativity and the arts, finally, it will always be a wind, finally, it will always be a windance.
And the question I want to bring all of this ideas?
It comes well this -- because it also looks like a centimeter of distance to me not to be good for anything that supposed to do not this supposition.
I think it's odiose.
And I think it's a dangerous and I don't want to see it in the next six.
I think it's better encouraging our great minds creative minds of living.
And I know that in my case -- in my case, in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to that I had a lot of supposed to be a deal of supposed to be in my careera.
Of course, it's a little bit of a year -- I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very likely to write that any thing write is going to be right from the world as the work that used to be the jobs that used to be a very last book.
It was just a sket, because we are all more or less friends here -- it's probably the most successful is to my big successful to my should.
Oh, Gesus more, you know, OK!
You know this is the genuine of thinking that brings a person to begin to the morning.
I would keep holding this work that we have.
So, the question becomes to the question become to the question becomes to the question becomes to the question become to the question becomes to the question become to the question become to the question become to the question become to the question becomes to to the question become to the question become to the question becomes to the question become to the question of the question become,
And so I seeding, after a lot of reflections, that the way to work to keep it to create a psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psynological cookey to do is to create a psychological psycholog
I have to find a distance of security of me, I am writing, and my natural reaction is that I written to the E, as I was trying to get E, as I was trying to look through the time, trying to see if I started looking through the time, trying to find other societies to see if they could see if they could have been a better ideas and see if they could have the more and I have a better ideas and I could have been a lot of the best ideas and write of the best ideas and I write --
As people like to help people to do emotion, inerents of creativity.
And that research was at the ancient Grecia and Roma.
Seguitems because it was a certain and then back.
In the ancient and the ancient Rome -- people don't seem to believe that the creativity came to the creativity came from humans, OK?
It was thought that the creativity was a deal of the divine and that was inspired by a few explain a few surgery and skill and spread -- to reach and spread and spread and spread and spread to the divine and spread and souldn't be a kind of the divine dive.
They called the gression of the demonstrate watching the demone."
Socrates, wonderful of course that has been a demon that elate sagency sand.
The Romans were in the same idea, but they called the kind of spirit without body of a genius.
The one is great as a lot of smart because Romans didn't think a kind of smart.
They believed that a genius was this kind of divina that has been live in the walls of a artist, a little bit like the efo Dobby, a little bit like the work of the work of the around, which came out of the work of the artist of the arms of the artist of the result of that work.
Every extremely -- exceptic is the distance of which is the psychological psychological that psychological results.
And everybody knew that was so that it works -- right?
So the antic artists were protects from certain things, like for example too narcism, right?
If your work was exceptional was not going to take all the market, everything knew that was helped that I was helped by this incorporary genius.
If your work work was not a lot of the work, it wasn't a whole bunch of your just?
They knew that was your genius.
And so people han concept the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then Rinascises came and all of change, and I put this big idea; we put the human human being; we put the human beings and no more leave and no more leaving space, and no longer space, and no longer to details from the divinity.
This was the principle of human existing and people began to think that creativity came to think that creativity came completely from ished.
And for the first time in the history, you know, it began to this artist as a genius, as a genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error herror.
I think it allowed somebody to create somebody to believe of being as a recipiently as the foundation, and the surprising of all my own own own own sides, creativity, inconnection, inconnect to a move filterm, or too big drop is a mostly too big droom or too big damones to be a fracgisterness of human beings --
It's like to ask somebody of an ingoid the sun.
Deform and histor, and creates all these ingestible exibitable expectations on performance.
And I think it was this pressure that I distroy the artists in the past.
And if this is true, and I think it becomes and now, and now, and now?
Can we can do it different?
Maybe to a more understanding understanding more ancient understanding of the relationship.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cancelling 500 years of rational thinking about a 18 minutes.
And there is probably people in the audience that would be live packets on the notion of the notion of the notion of the notion of the news of the fashion.
I probably don't really convince you all about this thing.
But the question I want to bring is -- why is we know?
Why don't don't think it in this way?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that I ever heard to explain the explain the process of creative process of creative process of creative process of creativity.
A process that as anyone who ever tent, as a lot of doing something -- so much of course, all of here -- you don't behavior to reactionally.
And, in fact, it can seemed to seeming a completely paranormal seeming paranormal seemed to be completely paranormal sometimes seem to be completely paranormal seemed to be completely paranorm.
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poet, who has been a poet, but it was a little bit for life, but it was a little bit for life and he said that during his infancial infection was a walks, and I heard the wall, and I heard the wall, when a poeter weren.
I said that it was like a fragorom tren.
And that was coming round to the landscape.
It was hearing to get to the Earth, because he had to get the earth in his pids.
It was a solid thing to do to that point and it was says, "Do you know, to run as a matta."
And so it goes to home and was insequarter, and he wouldn't have to do another one piece of paper, and a mathemates a piece of paper, as the translate and and a fastic and I would have to pay it on the pay and I would have to get it on the pain.
Some I couldn't be enough, so it was fast, so correct and the record and the record and the poety and the rolled rolled through the rolled and she would continue to roll and she would continue to roll the exactly goes through the exploit."
Then there were those times -- this piece of -- this piece of time -- there were no time that was allowed to perdent -- OK?
So, he was cording to home and was trying to stand was trying to charge and the poety was a mathemthem, and then he was a matheme in the past was a ball, and then he said, he was like it was a hand the hand and the off.
He was a poeter of the codle and the reputs and the reputting in his body and the payer.
And in these floor, the poety would be presented on the perfect page and intacross the last word to the first earlier to the first primal word to the first primal word to the first primal word for the first word of the last word of the perfect word for the last word of the last word to the last word to the last word for the last word to the last word for the last word to the last word of the last word for the last word of the last word of the last word for
So when I heard -- is a path, it's a broken exactly the process of my creative process.
Not my creative process -- I'm not a condute.
I'm a mul, and my way to work is to walk is, I can see it in the same orary every day and work on and work on and go to and go to the floor.
But even I wish in my head, I skilled against that thing,
And I imagine a lot of you have a lot of you have a face.
You know, even if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas I could not have to know that.
And what is this is this thing?
And how we can relate us to do not do us to lose the head, mapiration, that mapirate that hands are it?
And as I reduce the best example of the best example of Tom Waits, which I interview.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the major the major of the artist of the artist of the artor of control -- to control these species of a creative creative ines.
But then I was a hot -- and a day day was a day as he was he was driving on the authrow on the authrow of Angeles, he changed all for him.
It was going to go fast, and all of a skin this little basic framment of the heads as the inspiration, elusive elusive and the wish and you want to get it.
It has no piece of paper, it has no mathemates, it has no recorator.
So it starts to hear this kind of old old old old old old old him in him, "I'm going to be, and I'll bring it to this song, and I'll bring this song.
I'm not enough -- I can't do it --
And instead of going to stop up.
I'm going to put the whole process and they did something completely new thing.
And he looked at the sky and said, "Scusa, you don't see that I'm driving that I'm driving that I'm not going to see that I'm driving the sky?
"To seems that can write a song?
If you really want to exist, you know, it comes back to a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
Other you have to matter somebody else else anything else.
You go to the Leonard Cohen."
And his process of the working changed after that.
Not the work was still as a seedless as seeds.
But the process, and the fish that was released when the genius, the genius, the genius, the genius, the geniusing and it was a remajor the remad of where I was a whole thing that was a whole thing that was a whole thing that was a whole thing that was a whole thing that was a whole thing that was a whole thing of it.
but well this piece of piece of piece of pieces of a conversation between Tom and this strange and this strange and extremy that he had not Tom.
So I heard that story to change a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a time.
This idea, he save me when I was writing "Mangia, Pr, and he was a lot of those of those class of the disperation of those disperation of the disperation of something and we couldn't start thinking about something and I couldn't think that that that that that is going to be a piggly book.
Not just -- not the worst book.
And I began to think of design.
But then I remember the Tom who talked about the air and trills.
So I was my face in the handless and I saying, and I saying, I saw my bements to a room want.
And I said, "You're head, "Yeah, what do we know if this book not going to be brilliant not be brilliant to be brilliant not be brilliant to my?
Because as I see a little bit of what I do do I haven't more than that.
So if you want it to be better and you have to get you and do your parts.
Okay. But if you don't know what I don't know about it.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I want to want to be recorded that I today, I recorded to me to do my park, because I was -- the end is there, it's like OK -- secools in the deserts of North Africa was a broad, and the sacred of the mountil dances and sacross the basic dances and hours to the favor and hours to the albe.
And they were always magnific because the ballers, they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic.
But every tas, it was something happened, and one of these artists was actually transly.
And I know what I know about it, because I know that the view of course, a certain point, a lost of it.
It was like time you stopped and the ballery walking through a kind of brings and weren't doing nothing of different from the sun, as the 1,000 night -- but all of the 1,000 night --
And suddenly not appeared as a human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human
But it turns out of the dident, and under the divinity of divinity.
And when this happened, I was a time -- I knew what was, they were what he called her name.
They were in the hands and began to cant, "Ah, Allah, Do God, God, God.
That's God, you know.
She had a nice namic nately -- when the Mors invased the sound of Spain with their and pronuncil changed in the century changed in the century of "Aah, Allah, "Oh, oh, oh, "Oh, you can still hear in the float.
In Spay -- when a artist did something impossible and magic "A, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, hoh, hoh, a skyet, a skyet, a skyet,
And it's great because we need.
But the problem is the day down, the ballery of the stame, when you wood, and discovered that are 11 of Marteds and I was the 111 of Marteducation is not further there.
It's just a death, with a death, and maybe it will never be able to ascend to that alteze.
And perhaps no one will less the name of God even as I gave it with the rest of his life?
It's very difficult.
This is one of the most dolorous listations from making creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so ancient to be so ancient if you can not create believe, which the most extraordinary expects of your being from you to you have come from you to yourself.
But it has been given you get data in prestly prested by a inimaginable, of your life that is a part of your life that you have to spend somebody else when you find.
And, you know, if we think about this is all change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it is sure as I thought of a different months during the work of the book that I could prest, the dangerous book that I was a floor, exism, atter exist of my big deal of my big deal of my big deal of my big deal of my big book that I was a little bit of a book that I was a little bit of a book
And what I have to keep tell me when I feel when I feel feel in the wall.
Don't sware of your work.
He represented you to the light for your parts, any of any of any possibly can be.
If your work is ball, ball.
If the divine, you know, I measure a decide of left to leave some kind of wonderful time through your square in your sforces, then "Ole!"
Other today, you have the same dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself it.
I think I think and I think it is to teaching.
"Ole!" to yourself the being, even for human belove and head, and head to get you to get you to representing the connectable.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I talked about some of these projects on human genome on the human genome of new genes.
Now we're starting a new lost of the biology and we started digitalizing biology and now now to that code the digital code and synthetizing and synthetic sketizing and synthetically.
We always tried to bring a big questions.
"What is the lifesty?" is something that a lot of biological biologists have been taking a various levels?
We tried to have a different approaches, reducing it in terms.
We are a digitalizing almost 20 years ago.
When we sequenced the human genome is the human world was treating from the world of the biology of the computer.
Now we can regenerate the life, we can regenerate new life from this universe to digit?
This is the maps of a little organism, the Mycoplasma genome of the smallest genome of those who can authoreplasure in the laboratory.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit of a little bit more than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit more than a little bit of a little
We are able to eliminating a hundred genes about 500 of the field of the 500 of the field of the field of the hundred genes of the size of the field of the hundred genes of the 500 of the hundred of the 500 of the hundred genes of the size of the 500 of the field of the hundred
But when we look at his map, his map, it's relatively a mouse of the now.
And this is simple -- this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimind, one to the time, it's very improbably that this can bring to a live.
So we decided that the only way to progress to progress this cromosomes in a way to bring this crows to the components to bring some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the wind of the "Possing a cromother?"
It can make the chemistry of producing these big molecule that we never got to create before?
And, in case case, we can make a cromoma?
A cromosome, is just a piece of inerts.
The speed that we are able to digitalize the life is growing exponential growing exponential exponential that we are able to exponential degrees.
Our capacity to write the genetic code, instead of genetic disappeared.
And our more recently recently recently the door to a exponential curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has requires in a lot of puts, starting with a biothic review.
But we found that synthetize of DNA is very difficult.
There are thousands of thousands of the world that produce are machines of DNA of the mountain the mountain and it's a 30 to 50 leck and is a degenerative process is a degenerative process is a degenerative process is a degreater to the world that are a lot of the moonround of the world that are a degenerative degenerative deca
So we had to develop a new metom to assembling these framments and correct the errors.
And this was our first tent, particularly parts, particularly from the digital genome of Phi 174.
It's a small virus that killed kills.
We designed the framments, effect of the errors and I had a molecule of DNA of a lot of DNA of about 5,000 liters.
The interesting thing is when we took this piece of inergenetic material and we insert it in the bacteria started reading this code and cutting this genetic code and produce these virals.
The virals are then released by the cell phones, are back back and they distroyed the Ecouple of them.
I talked about recently with the oil industries of oil industries that they tried to that their own own own behind this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation that software can really build his hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the bigger things in big things.
We wanted to build the whole cromosome.
They're more than 580 miles of code code code of genetic code.
So we thought of built it in the size of the virus, so that we could change the cassets to understand what the cassets are components of a living cell.
The design is crucial information is crucial information in a computer, these are these have to be very accurated.
When we sequence, we sequence, in 1995 to 1995 the ethish of a standard for every 10 miles for every 10 mistay.
We discovered, 30 error squence, 30 error squence. If we had never been able to do it in a deal of doing it work.
A part of the process is to design segments that are wrong in the walls that are with all the other segments of 50 leck to build under the small working together.
We can exactly the element here.
You probably have read that we read in the phylig.
Think of this is a genetic code genetic code on four liter: A, C, GT.
Three of those lects together with about 20 friends, and there is a specifids, and there is a specific order to every mine of the skin every minoid.
So we can use the genetic code to write code of words, frather thousands.
What we did about the beginning was autiful time.
Some of the fact that was not a poek.
We designed these segments for a ter-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-half designed segments.
There are employees that reparts and put them together and put them together and put them together and put them together and put them together and put them together and put them together and put them together and put them together and put them together and put them together and put them together and put them together and put them out and put them together and put them out and it in them and put them up.
And we started to assembling the parts, starting with five to seven by five to seven the literally of 24 miles in a way to 24 mildle leck of 24 miles.
At every step we produced these segments in the abundance so that we can sequence, we are now trying to create a procept extremely robostop -- as you will see in a minute.
We are trying to automatizing the process.
So, this seems the tabellon a basic players.
When we look at these very long segments, more than 100 mile of 100 miles -- they don't growing more directly in Ecouple of Ecool.
You get to the limbing tools of the modern biology of molecular biology.
So we considered other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called recombination called recombination of a biology to repeak DNA to repart DNA in the centers.
Here is an example of an example of an example of example
This organism, called Deinococcus radioduring the three million radiation.
You can see in the square in the sound as his cromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was primary.
They were thousands of organisms that are in a lot of doing it.
These organisms can set out of it.
They can live under it.
They're absolutely certain life exists in space, and you get new environments of water.
In fact, the NASA showed that this aven.
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these process, just using the liview with the design approaches of the segments of inserious seatments.
The lievih lievised automatically.
This is not been taken with a chrooscope with a chrooscope with a microscope of rules.
It's a very big molecule that we could see it with a very well.
These are pictures that cover a six seconds.
This is the audience, we did a little time ago.
They're more than 580,000 lects code code of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of a structure that has ever created by the man.
It has a fish molecular of 300 million hons.
If we were going to passit a carefully carefully to transck this genetic code to transck this genetic code this code code of a code carefully --
Now, how do we work that work? How can we active it wors?
Of course, it is a virus is a game is a game play.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria.
It's just a simpler cells as a cell cells as our red: you can just extrare the nucleum and insert a nucleum and insert.
In the bacterium of a cromosome, it's integrated in the cells, but we recently have showed that we are able to do a complete trapic trapier of a cromosome.
We can make a party cromosome.
The two different are different as different as the men of topis.
We added some genes in a more way to decide that we could decide that to choose for this cromom for this cromom
The one has then scientists in a way to kill all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cell phone is stuff -- and you will appreciate our challenging softwo, the new cromosome.
And we started thinking we couldn't go to the beginning of it, but we tried to be a lot of a lot of the time.
This is one of the most experience mechanisms of evolution.
We discovered that a lot of species have added a second or a third of a second or a second of new thousands of new thousands of new trately.
So who think about evolution, as a gene of a gene of the biology.
There is a restrial of the restrial restrion is that addictions of the DNA.
The cromosomes that was in the cell phone is not a good thing.
The cromosomes that we inserito--ha.
And it was expressed and it recognized the other hand, as a crowds, and we recognized with only the cromom and the new cromom and the new cromom and the new cromom and the new cromom as a cromom as a crowd of the cromom as a cromom as a cromom and the new material.
it became blue because of the genes we insert.
And in a short of time, all the carefully of a kind of a kind of game, and it turned out of the new species, and it turned out to the new species, which we put in the new software that we insert in the cells.
All the protein are changed, the members are changed, and when we wood, and when we wood, we transfer what we transfer to you have transfer what we transfer with you.
Now, this could seem to look at the genetic software the software in DNA we can change the things in enough.
Now, I explain that you don't talk about genesis -- but I was a lot of evolution, and I said that maybe we have been a new version of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the explosion of this digital process of this digital process of this digital process of this digital process of this digital process of the genese.
Why do I think about this?
I think it is enough obvious when we think about our need to be the necessity.
We are going to spend six billion people at nine and a half billion in the next 40 years.
I was to give a example -- I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one of the planet for a year, in 40 years, there will be four year.
We are having problems now to find food, water food, water and clean and banity, medicinal and a half half a half billion people.
It will be more during it for us billion.
We are more than five billion carbon of carbon of a billion barbars.
That means a million bark holds a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to repirrate -- will be a challenge of a huge challenge of a huge challenge of a challenge of a huge challenge of a challenge of a challenge of a challenge of a challenge of a challenge of a challenge of a challenge of a challenge of a huge challenge of a huge chally.
In the most of the connect of CO2 emission of CO2 from these materials that finished in the atmosphere.
At the day, thank you very much, because of scientific discovered in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the designed components for the future.
The electronic industry is just a dozen of a components, and think about how many different things are coming out.
Our limites are data main the biological reality and our imagination.
Now we have a techniques, thank you very much, of synthetic synthetization, in a lot of creating what we call genomic genomic genomic combined.
We are able to build a big robots that can produce a million crobots that can produce a day.
Think of the processing these 20 million different genes or to try to get the processes to prove the processes to make a little vaccines, new vaccines, we can change a little team, and making more biology theory is a little bit of a little bit of science.
And it's just a standard.
We can chemices to chemical chemical for the chemical chemical devices, prodution or chemistry of vaccines.
This is a few software of some software programmed on that we're working for a lot of people to set us and designing species to the computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily as well as they would.
We know exactly coming out of their genetic code.
Now we're concentrate on the carbon of the generation.
You saw you even saw you that you experiment from the grate was a finish.
We have a lot of second and third generation that will using enough pretty soon as a zuccherero-burant fun or different kinds of bururders or different kinds of butanol.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without major major major the coest of food and limiting the disadddle is to transformation -- to be transforming the CO2 in primary materials that can be reach to design, and we could have a little bit of a generation in about 18 months.
The sunlight with the CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discovered in the world, we found different metodies.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean depth of 200 feet of the water perature of the water peratures of water.
It remakes the CO2 using hydrogen molecular energy as a source of energy.
We are trying to figure if we can instead of CO2, that can be transported tramount of the CO2 in the carbon -- to drive this process.
So that short we could be able to increase what the basic question is the very basic -- we have the real life, evidence is the real -- we have the fashion the oil.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where you can do?
It would be a major of energy.
And yet, we're working for the same metodds.
You saw this year with the influence, we're always behind a year and a dollar in less when it treatment.
I think that it can change building vaccines in the anticipate vaccinable.
That's how the future could began to change it seeming change, the tree of evolution, acceling the evolution, and infinally indeed, and infinally cellum and infinally cell.
We are so much of the best people.
Our discover is to live enough to try to do it very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
I will see the most of this is the more faster as possible, some work of the new technology that we took to Microsoft in the Microsoft in a year ago to a year ago -- this is Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon.
It's a environmental that you can interact is a local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data of visual data of visual data that you can interact with a huge amount of data that you can interact with a huge amount of the local amount of data that you can interact
So we're seeing a lot of gabytells of photos with a kind of garm, and continue for a fast bread, delivering the images as we want it.
And it doesn't matter how much the amount of information that we see how big these data or as a lot of these data or images.
Most is a digital photographs, but this for example is a provision of the Congres-old photographer of the Congress of Congress in the gamm of 300 megapixel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limiting the prestations of a system as this is the number of a system in any moment. It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a book book, for example of data not images.
This is the Casa desolated of Dickens. Every couple of a capitor.
So to show you that it is a head of tex, and not images, we can do a general thing to see that it is a representation of a representation of the head, not a photos.
It may be a little bit of a little bit of a electronic book.
You don't look at it.
This is a more realistic example of a number of Guardian.
Every big image is the beginning of a section.
And it will really give you the beautiful experience of a read version of a read version of a view or a lot of a very quotidian experience.
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of the Guardian.
We created a public advertising advertising -- much more higher than what it used in a normal public -- and we had you insert the content of the content of the content of the content of the extraordinary -- and we had inserve in a normal audience.
If you want to see the carefuistics of this auomobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific specific specific and it will be a techniques.
And this really really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space.
We hope that that means to put a little bit of a cheries and other porcheries and other porks, not remotic to be necessary.
Of course, the maping maping is one of the most obvious apples for this kind of technology.
And on this is not to lose the time, if not to say that we have contributed to give it in this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. S.
So now we're going to go to something else.
This is actually the websk; you can go to the webs; you can see it at it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which combined two different technology.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research, a very interesting research, a student, a student, a student of the U.S. and the Steve Seeadly Rick Seliski Szeliski Research.
And it is from the web, gestrate from Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen that we can past from another image of the image of the experience and have this kind of experience resolution.
But the collocasting of the images here has actually a meaning.
The gorithms of visualization of the computer have recorded these images together, so that they records to the real-ligion that imagines -- all the neighborhoods. The Grashi Grashi Roccic -- have been taking of a slide-viewable stable, and these things are all the space.
I don't know if I have to show you some other environment.
And there are a lot more spaces.
I want to spend a directly of the nest data of Noah-- and this is from a previous prototynthy prototosynthy -- to show you what we did worked for the first time -- to show you what I think is really the key technology is really the key technology, Photosynth. And it's not necessarily evident in the samazing environment.
We had to worry about the legal expects and saying it.
This is a rebuilding in the catter of Notre--digitlickr. Basta digitate Dame in Flickr and you get images of the field of the field of the field of the field of these connections and saying that is a picture that is discovered to this model.
So I'm all pictures pretty well as Flickr and were all colleged in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I never thought of finished to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratificive this kind of accool here.
I think you can see that it is a lot of different kinds of foth photoamer: from those cell photos in the SLR, a number of SLR, a number of these environmental photos together in this environment.
And if you can go to looking for those strangers.
Many are block from fact, except --
She got a lot of photographs -- except of photographs -- except of photographs -- exacts.
This is a Notregistrated place.
We can go from the places to the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do with social environmental environmental -- from the interact collective of how to appears the Earth, from the point of view -- and collect all those data together all these data together.
All of those pictures become together, most of the slights.
You have a model of the Earth, which is going to be there.
Think about this as a long as a long hard work of Stephen Lawler on Earth
It's something that grows in complexity as people using it, and the people usually using it for those us.
Their pictures are marched with other people.
If somebody is the idea of contransporting all these ses saying that name is my picture of Notare a crural Notare of Notare suddenly recchips of all these data, and I can use the point of engineering the space, in that universe, using the experience of the cross--us-s-usering social experience.
Of course, a consequence of all these are virtual models of every interesting part of the earth, not just a view. It doesn't just just just a view.
Thank you very much.
CA: I understand that is the one is that your software is going to be going to be a certain point, in the next few years, all the photographs in the world will be practice.
BA: Yeah. What is doing in practice.
Se's creating hyperlink, if you want to be in images.
And it's doing it in the base of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the reck of information that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images.
As when you do a research of images on the web, and the head of the web has a lot of information about the web images of the pictures.
Now, what happens if that pictures to all your pictures of your picture?
So the amount of interconnection, and the amount of the reccheactic that is really enormous effect of the rett. It's a classic effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible. It is really incredible.
BAA: You thank you very much.
One of the principal place when you travels and one of the ethnic research is the power between who didn't dementically the anti-traditions, between those who have the past, top the past, top the past, top the place of the place pleasant and loating the plants.
Bast's thinking that sciamans Jaguar is still over the Viia is still the Lattea, or that the mites are still cools of meaningful significant -- or who in Himalayaa, the world is still the respired of the respired Dharmal is a remind of the importance of the amount of the amount of the idea that we live in sense that we live not exists in a sense of the world that we live in a sense of the world of the world of the world in the world in the world that we are a reality.
the consequence of a particular choices of choices that our stirps of a lot of generations or mal, a lot of generations ago.
And, of course, we all share of the essential trately.
We all all all of it. Everybody procrey.
We are dreams in the beginning of beginning to began to the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the begins.
We have to deal inexorsability of death, so we don't surprised us and ballous --
We all have a art.
What the range is the particular of the chang, the ritical range of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Earths of the Borneo, or the Voodoo of Haiti, or the Design Kair in Kair Saw's Kair in Kenya settrial field of the Sahara.
He was my journey companies in the desert of a month ago, or a hyak in the vallenge of the Qomolangma, the demomother of the world.
All these people teaches us are other ways of existing other ways of thinking about it, other ways of thinking about move in the world.
And if you get a float, it's a fall, it's a concept that can give you hope.
Insieme, my own cultures of the world create a ragnatela of life and cultural life that has been the planet and cultural biosphering the planet, as the raignatela as a biosphers.
And you can think about this ragnatees as a hours like a hours and you can definition and you can definitive the ethods, dreams, dreams, myths, inspirations, mythized, inspirations, intuitions of consciousness.
The ethnossphere is the fantastic patrimon.
It's the symble of what we can be in as a inquisist of what we can be in as a inquisist of what we can be in a kind of what we can be in a kind of inquisisish symb.
And because of the biosphere was floor, it was floor, it was a further and pururtroop, much more faster than the etnight.
No biologist, for example, it would say 50, it would be on the extinction of the extinction is a falk, or -- in the most advances -- in the most address -- in the most of biological biologic -- and not neighborhoods.
The indical of all is, of course, the persent language.
When you're born in the countried to this planet.
A language is not just by a vocabolary or a series of rular rules of rules.
One is the language is the spray of human spirit human spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit.
It's the mean with the animation of every culture is in the world in the material.
English is a forest, a forest, a thinking of the inspiritual system of the spiritual system of the spiritual system of the spirituals.
And of those 6,000 language, as we sat Monterey, at least the half of the half is not sussurgery in the earth of the children.
They don't have to come teacher children, which means that it means no feeling something, which is already death.
What is more than the tristers of being flight from silence, of being the last to talk a language of the wisdom of the wisdom of the wisdom of the daughter?
This is a fashion is somebody in some part of the world every two weeks of a weeks and brings a woman and leads with slavery in the tombs of a anthic.
And I know somebody who will tell you "Is it "Is it not better than this?
The world would not be a better places if we talk about all the same language?" Benism, then we all talk yorub. We are all working cant.
We talk about kogi.
You're going to tell a track thing that you want to talk about their language.
I would like to do a journey to do a journey through the etner --
a little journey in the etnesses of what we're lost of what we're loying.
Most of us forget that when I say "different different exister." I mean a very different exister."
We take for example this bimbo Barasana, in Amazon the settenters, the population of the anaconda, that creates to the milk of the hand-hand-hand-hand-hot delivers of the sacric sacric sacric of the sacridge of the bo sacrill.
It's a population of a population that is not to distinguishing the blue color, because the chelests is identify in the forest, from which is identify in the forest,
They have a strange language and a rule, "examply language, "examply language, you have a person who talked about a person that was a different language.
Everything has radicated in the past, all the particularity is that in these family family is that in these family family seven language because of the mathemthemes of the mathematics of a language.
They listening to listening and then they began to speak.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived with the Waorans of the Ecuador in the earth of the incredible that has had the first contact in 19588.
In 1957, five missionary missionary mission of a commercial contact of a face.
They made up up from the high photographs that were running them in a few few that they were involved that this population population of the forest, which is never seen anything that was never seen anything that was never seen anything to see about bi-dimensional forest.
They collect the photos from the earth, they have a research of a form or a figura -- they have conclums that was the diving, they killed the did, and they killed five with the sive milarge.
But Waorananans don't just killed the strangers.
They killed in them.
Five percent of the mortality was because of their own death was because of their death mortality was because of a floor.
We are risalitites to eight generations and we found two household, and when we insisted that one of them was instead of them was insteady, and then they killed it was a mind of the same.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope I hope to be a lot of the college of college in the case not notaste.
I want to start with what I call "the dogm dog.
The offical dogm of thing?
The offical dog, the offices of all societies in the Western West: "If we want to male the well-being of our citizens."
The reason is that the liberty is in the fact that liberty is in the same value, is precious, it's precious,
Another in the fact that if we are free, each of us can act to do everything that massimizes our well-being, without no one that we decided in none of our well.
The way to massimizing the liberty is myzing choice.
More people choices people are free, more freedom, more is their freedom, it's their freedom, it's their well.
These are the range is so foundly radicated in the society that nobody would be doub.
And it's also a fundamental in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress.
This is my surmarket. It's not particularly very big things.
I put a simple named a simple named sounds for inheaven.
In my surmarket is 175 conditions, without contains, without contains 10 varietes of olive and 12 acets of the balsh of a big balsamic falsky's growing the skills of the instead of the instead of your degraded.
That's the surmarket.
And then you go to the snegotio to buy a stere: cassroom of CD, radio, fast, printing --
And in this single snegotial of electronic components is a big number of holds.
We can make six million different than a million different combinations using the components that there are in a negotial.
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Other than the world of communications.
One fly when I was a child, you could get all the services of the phones wish phones -- the path of mam.
He wood, you didn't buy it wouldn't buy it up.
One consequence of that, in the other one was that the phone is that the phone is not broken most.
These are these are gone of the time.
So we have a variety of phones almost illitted with the phones, especially between cells.
Here's the future.
My favorite is in the middle, MP3, the tape of the basic and the hind for the crash of the bule.
If you have never seen in the negotid, you know, you're well looking at certain you who predict up.
And what happens is that people are in the negozes in the negozes and does this question. And you know what the answer? The answer?
It's not possible to buy a cell phones that not do too much too much of it.
So, in other ways, in other ways.
She knows health health in the United States that you go from doctor and the doctor and the doctor what you have to do.
And I mean, you go to doctor, and the doctors, "Okay, we could do A, or B" "A, you can do A, "As these wells and these wells and these well?"
You know, "Dr, what would I have to do you do?"
And the doctor says, "As these wells and these risks, and it has these well-well."
"What do you want to do you do?"
And you can get to me, "Dr. if she was me, what to do you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not lei."
The result is called the autonomy of the malato," expression that it seeming it seeming a beautiful thing.
But it is not a swop and responsibility and responsibility to take decisions to somebody else that anything else, somebody else that doesn't know anything -- and so certainly it's a disease, and so it doesn't have to be a condition, and so it doesn't have the patient.
There is a marketing marketing products of making drugs, I direct people like me and you, if you think about you, you know, if you think we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy them -- why do they publish?
The answer is that they want to deal with the doctor, we call the doctor.
Something of that is our identity is our identity of the choice, as you see in this view of the just, "We don't want to force the right moment of the right moment of the right moment of the right moment of the right moment of the right now is a more identity?
And we can reinvented us to agree us aggreat.
The means that every morning, to the risk of the risk, you have to decide that kind of person.
And I respect to the family and mathematrimon, a time prospective for a few few of time, it was that it was that you could get the pretty much as possible, and he started the most pretty possible.
The only choice was with choice, not here, and even what do later, and even what do later.
Ogame, everything is really to play.
I mean, in a lot of smart students, and I do 20, at less than a time.
And they don't think they're brilliant less because they don't think they're less than hard diligents.
but why I would have a charge to ask to ask me I would say, "I would have to do it now?"
"I would have to think about it before I think before I did I think before I do it before I do that?"
They're interrogatives --
And they are trying to answer these questions, even if this imply doesn't completely compity, not to get a lot of the vote vote to my example.
And they have to really do that. They're important.
Now, the work: we have lucky, as Carl technology -- because the technology we enjoy to work every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, trans that from Hotel Randolph.
To parents is a corn, and I'm not going to tell anybody where the Wii work.
You don't say that I want to use it.
What meaningly, this incredible liberty liberty liberty of the work? Is that we have to decid, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our best broads in a task in a task in a task in the other, and the news in the other, and the nest ness of the eye and the nest news --
And even if they're all spent, every minutes that we see our boy wind the parents, we're also asking this called called "Do I have to answer this called the ata?"
"I have to answer this email? I have to abbozar?"
And even when the answer is "now, all this makes experience the experience of your best bad in other conditions.
So, from any part of any part of it, things like this, little bit of a lot of the phostils and life is a question.
One time the world was this: One was a few choice, but it didn't all have a choice.
The world today: The dilemma is a positive thing -- "Is it is a positive thing.
The answer is She's Sat.
The positive is a positive of the negative -- so I'm going to talk about the negative negatives
All this choices two effects negative effects on the people.
The first one is that it has been working on the early instead of freezed.
With a lot of options that choice, it becomes very difficult to do it.
You want you to offer an example of meaning a significant conduct the plans of the involunteers.
A college of my colleagues of Vancial Vancial of thought, with about a million deployees of a million clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are going to come offered in the more, the percent.
With 50 founds, there is 10th less than the adesions when they are available to only 5. Why?
Because with 50 foot foot that choice, is maledetail, and the choices is remaking a choice.
And the question and still questions, and the questions, questions, and of course, is not going to be mained.
You know that it doesn't mean that that these works from wind well-well foot for cancer, because they don't have enough money because they don't have enough money to even even the complete data of the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator work.
Don't shot up to 50,000 dollars a year of work, that would be well disposed to the dator of the drink them to the drink of the dator of the drink of the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator of the data of the data of the dator a lot of work, that would be a well disorder.
So the paralysized is a consequence.
And I think that makes the world like that.
"And finally, for the eternity: ketchup, or major majores?"
You would take the right decision is to take the right decision, if it's for the age, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong wrong the wrong condition.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we could evitate the paralysis and do a choice, we end up to the result of how we were going to be with less options of how we were going to be a choice.
And this is a different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of these is that with the choose, and you know, if you buy a and it's not perfect that you could have a choices that would be better to do a choice, which happens is that the alternative imagined us induce and the choice, and the choice, and the received the choice, and the received the received by the decision of the choice, and the receiving.
even when it was a very good decision.
More choices us -- more easy dispiacive than anything details that insoddddispic of choice.
And yet is what economists call the opportunity is the opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asked a very well stamates as the value of what we confront of what we confront with what we confront with it.
In the case, when there are many options, it's easy to represented the careistic careful carefully and being less to be less soundddiscovered in the options that you have choice.
Here is a scusual scusing for all of the ones that are not New York.
But that's what probably probably thinking about it.
There's this copy to Hamptons.
A place of susside.
Spids. It is splendies. It's all a day. It's all for them.
Not nothing about hands is "Well, what he thinks is Austo."
"Everybody all my neighbors in Manhattan are vie."
"I could talk about it in front of home."
And it past two weeks away from the idea that is persent -- every day -- every day -- every day -- the possibly of parking where you want.
The cost-opportunity diminishes the soddddiscovered that we have, even when the choice was excellent.
And more is the opportunity we have to consider the most of the carefully attrootic carefully as expensive to the opportunity.
Here is another example.
This views says a lot of things.
It talks about the moment, and maybe of the living of live live slowly.
But the importantly, is that any of whatever you choices -- you choices not do the others.
The things that don't choose have a lot of four that can make less less attrootic what we do.
Ter: spiral growing growing of the expectancy.
I tried on my skin, and I tried a new jeans.
At almost always jeans.
One time time the jeans were a guy, they were a lot of a guy and wind were comfortable to have them a lot of a life and worked a lot of times, they started well.
So I went to buy a couple of new when the old old old old old old old me a couple of jeans, this is my cuteans, this is my cute."
And he said, "You want you to seem fitch, "Deasy fit?"
He wants to do with the cernier of the bottony? "Stones?
"Let you want to extrain the room want?"
"Soth them want to be a broken or strettles? Bla blak -- Continy
I was slowed to say, "I was a little bit of a little bit of a charg, which was the only one guy -- that it was a little bit of a jeans, so I tried all of the negotio, and then I got the best jeans, and then I had been a best jeans that I had never been doing it.
It was the masside. It was a choice had a basic had a basic hold.
But I heard I was worse about it.
Why? I wrote a book of interor to understand it.
The reason I was worse is that I was that I was that choices were expectations were altis; the jeans had to be perfects.
And I began an expectts. I didn't expected. I didn't existed when you existed a guy, but when you go in 100 different thousands of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of being perfect.
What I had water was good -- but not perfectly well.
After that was working on what I was trying to get to insoddddisplayed in confront of it.
The add of options in life of the people don't have to increase expectations that these are respective of the options.
And this will produce less soddddiscovered when the results are good ones.
None in the world of marketing if you make it content.
Because if you know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
"You was better when he was worsed when he was worsed when he was worse when you were worsed when he was worse when he was worse was a lot of encounterms was still possible to meet of surprised floors.
Ogunner in the world that we live -- opulents, industrialized citizens with the perfection -- the male that we can hope is that the things are things to the treatment.
You never have to resources to be expectancy because of your expectancy expectancy are ingigant.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is "Baspect."
I mean, little bit of a authobiographic moment -- which is really wrong and my wife is really stuff is very stuff.
I could not have a better better better hand, I don't have been accounted.
But I don't always have a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of a couple of jeans of jeans when there is just that kind of jeans is that when you don't have to ask yourself, "Why you don't have to ask "Why you know, "You're going to ask a couple of a couple of jeans of a couple of j
"Who is responsible to here?
The world is the responsible to us?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insoddddisor, and you ask you who is responsible, is a responsible that responsible is a lot of a responsible yourself there.
You could have a better better better better.
With hundreds of varieties, there are no choices for insuccess.
So when people are taking decisions, even if the result is valized, and they sented the reddundate and damage their own own own own stand they live their own own own own their own own own own own their own own own own their own own own own their own own own own decisions,
In the last years the last years the depression is exploded in the world industrialized.
I think a meaningful factory -- not the unique -- not the unique -- of this depression is that people have experiences to the deluddent is too further because the standard standards.
And when they have to explain this situation thinking that the colp,
So the final result is that in general -- we are a basic -- but we feel worse about it.
Let me tell you that remember it.
This is the office, what we all take a good and it's completely false.
There's no twice one of a little bit of a choices is better than I haven't have a lot of choice.
There is a critical value of a critical value of it.
But I'm sure we have super-found that we have super-piece of the level that choices our life.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost finished -- from the polic, the crowd is the follow.
What it allows all this choice in the industrial society is the recheactic material.
There are many places in the world, and you know excharges, which is not that have too much choice.
The problem is that they too much further fall.
So the face of the face that I'm talking about is a burclusive modern, rich societies society.
And what does it down, and arrabbing is this: Steve Levitt talked about iers as a hyesterday's set and comfortable to be involved in monkeys to money for money to money.
I mean, that these choices, complicated and dispendose, it's not just inuseful inuseful --
They're deletters.
They do a worse of worse.
If a little bit of what our society perhaps lometed was reversated in those where people have too points too points -- it would not just be better for their life to be better --
This is what economists call a better pareties.
A redistribution, it's not just about -- not only of the poor poor -- not only of this choices in this choices that returns out there to us to us.
And he said, "You can become all of what you want, you can become everything that means --
You know, people are culture, you think, "But what the weight is what the fish issu?"
"It's obvious you can make anything in a bought in a bought of vetrow."
"As the floor, a light view of the world."
and I was the interpretated thing, at the beginning of the beginning of the beginning.
But then, I think about that, instead -- I realized that that the fish of that fish know.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you eat the frank of the bouth of the liberty. You can't get the freedom. You don't have a paraly.
If you rops the mouse of it all become possible to be the defect sodddddiscovered.
You touch the parals, and you reduce the well.
Everybody need a sphere.
