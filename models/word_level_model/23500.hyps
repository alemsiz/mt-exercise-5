<unk> year I showed these <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> this <unk> of the problem because it doesn't show the <unk> of ice.
<unk> <unk> is, in a way, the <unk> <unk> <unk>'s heart system.
It's <unk> and <unk>.
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
You see, it's <unk> down to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which is <unk> summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years or more, it's like the blood here, which is <unk> from the body.
In 25 years it's been so, in 25 years.
This is a problem because the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that, <unk> are <unk> in <unk> by <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, <unk> this point of not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> from the water.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: She's good. The question is if we're <unk> it.
And it's a reason that <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk>, here is where the sea.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the other hand of the planet: <unk>, the biggest <unk> of ice on the planet.
<unk>, scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk>, and that <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> at <unk> feet of the <unk>, as in <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the third largest <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which a few years ago were <unk>.
40 percent of the world's population <unk> water from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of this city.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, the same happens to the <unk> water.
In California <unk> on <unk> <unk> is 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, as you read, they're <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in the world is <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and not <unk>.
Sometimes, it's over the last 30 years to <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk>.
If you look at it in the <unk> context, they can see the <unk>.
In the last five years we've been <unk> 70 million <unk> -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day.
Look at the <unk> <unk>, from <unk>, to <unk>, and both of the <unk> <unk>, and both of the <unk> <unk>, where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean.
The <unk> of global <unk>, <unk> <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk>, together to China.
And they're <unk> to build a lot of other <unk>.
But we're <unk> a <unk> of the <unk>.
These are the <unk> projects over the last years and some <unk> <unk>.
And anyway, there's a <unk> policy in our country.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
<unk> image me something --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> billion <unk> of <unk>.
Maybe you saw on the <unk>.
This is the second largest flow in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> â™« <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and grow our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is <unk>.
It's <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: From this is a lot of <unk> <unk>.
The biggest <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> is <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is one of them, one part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk>: <unk> we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> in our business.
So, for our <unk> is <unk> a lot of money in a public <unk> <unk> and <unk> the truth in <unk>.
In fact, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it's got a good <unk>.
So we don't know about climate change.
We should be doing it.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of it.
So we're going to <unk> a <unk> <unk> structure for <unk>.
<unk>! <unk> are a little bit, but this is the sound of the technology of <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global <unk>, but the <unk> technology <unk> that you see changes everything.
Let's look at this: <unk> technology's <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: America is in the crisis; the national <unk>, the <unk> crisis.
The <unk> that <unk> all of it: our <unk> <unk> <unk>, like <unk> and <unk> oil.
Now, there's a new <unk>, <unk> solution to <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy in 10 years.
A <unk> plan to <unk> America to work, <unk> more <unk>, and to help <unk> global warming.
<unk>, a solution that we're going to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more. <unk> more.
<unk>: This is the last one.
<unk>: It's about <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> to <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, sun, a new network.
<unk> <unk> 2: <unk> <unk> for jobs well.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: A <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go to <unk>, you go for themselves.
If you want to go far, you go together. "
We have to go far, fast.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED, a <unk> on <unk>.
And they're going to try to <unk> it about how the machine works.
So, I'm <unk>. And for those that were not, the other time, the <unk> is the biggest scientific experiment -- <unk>.
<unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were in the less than a <unk> <unk> from the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second.
All of this is just <unk>.
This is the <unk> machine.
We <unk> these <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
This is what I work on. It's <unk> <unk> feet and it's <unk> feet and a <unk>.
This is a picture of <unk> <unk> in construction in construction, so you can see the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the machine for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was <unk> <unk> in the control <unk>.
It's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had all done the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles inside the <unk>.
In other words, when you <unk> that picture, the <unk> <unk> that the <unk> machine, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to <unk> us more or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and I knew that the <unk> page was this.
That means we've had a <unk> impact beyond the scientific impact over to that.
And we had a week later, there was a problem with the machine, had to be <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works in the <unk> of <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you are <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. I'm <unk> too <unk>."
And they can do that because when they're very <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, <unk> degrees <unk>, at the <unk> temperature <unk> to the space between stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, there was a <unk> <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and that <unk> are <unk> about 30 <unk>.
It's about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
Now they're <unk> all <unk> to their <unk> place.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be again.
We <unk> it, and we hope to get data <unk> or <unk>, and continue so our <unk> to discover what the universe is.
Now, of course, in a way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering engineering <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think the fact that it's so hard, the fact that it's the value of things like <unk>.
I'd like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> of <unk> experiments of his <unk>, his <unk> was <unk>, he said, "No <unk> so <unk> for the <unk> of the human mind as the <unk> that the ideas of science are, that there are no new <unk> in nature, that there are no new <unk> in nature,
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> when, from children, <unk>, <unk>.
As we <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, actually to think and <unk> problems.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> most of the world around us.
So, as a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects, together to my <unk> <unk> <unk>, and I started <unk>, and I started <unk>, "And if we use a computer, instead of having the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk>, hands.
and we <unk> <unk>?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer, building the <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> big as a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> big as a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with their hand, they can <unk> their <unk>, and they have a screen and a <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, like <unk>, you can just <unk>.
<unk> are the example of a new tools to <unk> information.
And as they become <unk>, <unk> of the <unk>, of the <unk>, of others, and as they become <unk>, <unk> of its movement, <unk> of the other, of how we <unk> them, we can explore new and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Let's start with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you some video: if you put it in a direction, the other <unk>, the other <unk>, you'll get the other <unk> back.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others.
If you <unk> them, they're <unk> what they're going to be <unk>.
If they're <unk>, they're <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit.
If they're <unk>, they're <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit.
We also <unk> their <unk> and <unk>.
We've then realized that one of the interesting <unk> was the <unk> that we could use common data on data, for example, "<unk> color as if it was a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> color in the <unk>, where they <unk>.
and I can <unk> to <unk> of color in the central one where it is.
We can <unk> too much, we can <unk> it up a little bit.
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk>, like <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and games where people can <unk> to try things where people can <unk> things, and <unk> the results immediately.
Now, I'm --
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a <unk> of words that is in the middle of <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, <unk>, every <unk> <unk>, every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, and as I was <unk> in <unk> words, he <unk> on a <unk>.
Then, after about 30 seconds, you're <unk>, and you have a new chance to try.
Thank you.
Here we have children in <unk> at <unk> <unk>, I did so that I <unk> them and <unk> a video.
They're very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of <unk> is you don't have to <unk> many <unk>.
I just say, "<unk> of words," and they know exactly what to do.
Here we go.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, there on the right.
It actually wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
We wanted to build a tool for the <unk> of <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
Here, it's the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now, he took a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! Yes! Yes!
So, <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with <unk>, and can decide how it <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with <unk>, and can decide how it <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> away, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, <unk>, and <unk> music.
it's a <unk>, which is <unk>, to <unk> and <unk> music.
<unk> here from <unk> as you're <unk> as a <unk>, low and <unk>.
<unk> of these four different <unk>, and you can choose what to use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence from <unk> to your <unk>.
And we just <unk> by doing a sound and a sequence.
These are the effects that you can control from live, like <unk> and <unk>.
We're going to <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> it up to <unk>.
And then there are the <unk> effects of time and <unk>, which is <unk> to the whole sequence.
It's going to be like this.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>," the <unk> in a series, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
Now, we're going to take a <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: Now, let's <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk>, so I can control the effect of live.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> the whole sequence of time on one hand or on the other.
<unk>: <unk>: And now we're going to <unk> the bottom to <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> the <unk>.
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the whole sequence on the left <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain works.
And today, I've had time to show you one of the results of this <unk>, and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept that I want to <unk> is that it's <unk> this new generation of objects that we're going to <unk> information in our world in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the <unk> with all of you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more than that, obviously.
It's also the love and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't expect that can change.
But, he said, something particular has been <unk> in my life and my life, who brought me to <unk> the whole relationship with this job.
The particular thing is that I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that everywhere we're going to be <unk> now, people <unk> me as they were <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to <unk> all of <unk> and say, "You don't fear to be able to do it more?
You're not afraid to write for all life without being able to create a book that can <unk> to someone? "
that can <unk> to someone? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could be worse, except that I remember over 20 years ago, when I started to tell people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I <unk> the same <unk> by fear.
And people said, "Don't you know you don't know you're not going to be able to have?
You're not afraid that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> you?
You're not afraid to do this <unk> for all life without <unk> anything comes out and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk>? "
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is, "Yes."
Yeah, I fear of <unk> all of that.
I've always had fear.
And I also fear of many other things that people couldn't <unk>.
How <unk> and other things happen.
But, as it is to write what I was and <unk> <unk> is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel in order to do.
But what is so <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don't do?
My father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I don't remember one time in his <unk> years of activity in <unk> that he asked if she was asked to be <unk>?
There was never -- that <unk> of <unk> John, how does it go?
<unk>'t <unk> it so, <unk>?
<unk>, the engineers as a group of <unk>, in <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not only <unk>, but <unk> of all kinds, we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
And they're not going to be looking at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, <unk> young people and often for them.
And even the ones that they're not seem to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before he died, in the last <unk> said, "Every book my book has <unk> me a little bit more <unk> about the work of their own life.
But we don't know when we <unk> it to say why we've heard these things so far as we have all <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some <unk> way <unk> and the art, at the end, <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> all here is, you know, I agree with this idea?
It's good for this thing -- because it's going to be <unk> by a <unk> away, and it's not good at all.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better to <unk> our great <unk> <unk>.
And I know that, in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that I'm going to be in my career.
<unk> -- <unk> look, I'm pretty young, I've got 40 years.
I have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything that's going to happen in the world like the job that <unk> after the world's success of my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all <unk>, and it's <unk> that my biggest success is <unk> to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, <unk>, that thinking!
You know this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to start <unk> at nine at <unk> in the morning and I don't want to do that.
I should continue doing this work that I love.
So, the question is, how?
And so it seems to me, after many <unk>, that the way to work to do is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk>, OK?
I have to do it some way to be able to find a distance of <unk> between me, and the natural <unk> on which is <unk> to get more <unk>. And as I was <unk> for this last year, trying to find other society. And as I'm going to see if you're going to be better ideas and see if you're going to be better ideas and <unk> ideas to see if you're going to be better ideas to see if we're going to have better ideas and
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research has taken me to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
It's because they're going to <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that creativity <unk> creativity from men, OK?
And he thought that creativity was this <unk> <unk> and <unk> to <unk> men somewhere in <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> reasons <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far.
<unk> were the same idea, but they were the <unk> species of the spirit without a <unk>.
which is <unk>, because <unk> didn't really know that a <unk> was somebody particularly smart.
And I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, a little bit like the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> out the <unk> of <unk> the artist, and <unk> the result of that work.
<unk> <unk>, here is the distance of which I'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work.
And everyone thought it was so that he was <unk>, right?
So, the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like the too <unk>, right?
If your work was <unk>, you couldn't <unk> the <unk>, everybody <unk> that was <unk> by this <unk> <unk>.
If your <unk> work, it wasn't all your <unk>, right?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people are <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
And then the <unk> and everything <unk>, and we <unk> this big idea; we put the human center over the universe above all of the universe, and <unk> and not leave and leave and leave and not <unk> space to the <unk>.
This was the <unk> <unk> and people began to think that creativity is <unk> from <unk>.
And the first time in history, it <unk> to <unk> to this, or that artist as a rather than a person with <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think that was a big <unk>.
I think that somebody, a simple person to believe that it's like a <unk>, <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's like <unk> somebody <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> the <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure to have been this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years.
And, if that is true, and I think it's the question, it becomes, and now?
Can we do that <unk>?
We're going to go back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between human and <unk> <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> <unk>'s talk.
And there are probably people in the public who <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, <unk>, you know, people <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects.
You're probably not going to <unk> you on this thing.
But the question I want to <unk> is -- why not?
Why not <unk> in this way?
Because it has more sense of anything that has ever heard to explain the <unk> of the <unk> process.
A process that, as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so, basically, all here -- knows, all here -- knows, you don't <unk> <unk>.
And in fact, it can sometimes look completely <unk>.
I did this <unk> <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years old, but that was a <unk> for all of life and said that during his <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> it, within a <unk> <unk>.
He said he was like a <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> to her from <unk>.
We <unk> it up, because he was <unk> the earth under its feet.
We decided to have one thing to do to that point and was of, words, "<unk> as a <unk>."
And he came to the house and he came from this <unk>, and he shouldn't have to take a piece of paper and a <unk> <unk> enough, and a <unk> <unk> and <unk> on the page.
And we couldn't be enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without being able to get to home to <unk> through the <unk>, and she would <unk> through the <unk>, looking, and she said, "another <unk>."
And then there were these times -- this piece of the time I had ever -- there were <unk> moments when he was almost <unk>, right?
So, he was <unk> home and was looking for paper and the <unk> through, and he <unk> a <unk> right in the <unk>, and he was <unk>, and he said, that was as if he <unk> with the other hand and <unk>.
We <unk> the <unk> from the tail and <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page, but in the last word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first.
So when I <unk> him -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not the whole process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; I'm going to <unk> the same <unk> every day and <unk> and <unk> on the <unk>.
But even I was in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I think many of you <unk> the <unk>.
You know, even if the job job and ideas <unk> me from a certain source of I couldn't <unk> <unk>.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it in it so that we don't lose your head, but rather, rather, what does it <unk> us?
As it is to me, the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I've been <unk> <unk> several years ago for a <unk>.
I was talking about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life has been the <unk> of the <unk> artist, trying to control, <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then <unk>, he was <unk>, and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk>, he was <unk> up for him.
<unk> fast and everything of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk>, which is coming into his head as the <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and it wants, you know, it's wonderful, and the <unk>, but it doesn't know how to <unk>.
It doesn't have a paper, it doesn't have a <unk>.
So it starts to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> <unk> in him, "I'm going to lose, and <unk> <unk> <unk> from this <unk> song.
I'm not <unk> and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of going to go to the <unk>, they <unk>.
He <unk> the whole process and did something completely new.
He just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>, you see I'm <unk>?"
"Do you like to write a song now?
If you really want to <unk>, you're going to be <unk> when I can take care of you.
<unk>, we're going to <unk> more.
<unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his <unk> process after this.
Not the work, the job was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that came from him, and he <unk> it back where he was, he was <unk> that he <unk> that he had no thing that <unk> and <unk>.
But <unk> this <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that's <unk> and <unk> that's not <unk>.
So, how I <unk> that story to change a little bit even the way I <unk> and already <unk> me once and I've been <unk>.
This idea, I was <unk> when I was <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and I <unk> it into one of the <unk> that we're all working on the time, and you're not going to do that, and you're not going to do that, and you're not going to be a <unk>, which is going to be a <unk>.
Not just <unk>, right the <unk> book.
And we started thinking about <unk> this project.
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> and <unk>.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of the room.
And I said high <unk>, "<unk>, what, we know, we know that if this book is not going to be <unk>, right?
Because as you see, I'm <unk> everything I have, I don't have this.
So if you want it to be better, you have to <unk> and do your part.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know, I'm not going to <unk> it.
I started writing the same because it's my job.
And I would like to be <unk> that I've been <unk> to do my part. "Because at the end is so, OK -- <unk>, <unk> is the way, OK -- <unk> is in the <unk> of the moon, <unk> and <unk> music that <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> and <unk>.
But every once a lot, <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know what I'm talking about, because I know that you've all seen, at some point, a <unk> <unk>.
It was as if time <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was going to be doing anything different from the <unk>, as the <unk> <unk> before, but it <unk>.
And all of a sudden we don't just <unk>.
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
And when this <unk>, at the time, people <unk> what was, he <unk> him.
<unk> your hands and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, I <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>
In <unk>, when an artist did something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's <unk> because we need it.
But the problem comes up to the next day, for <unk> itself, when you <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> God's <unk>.
It's just a <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and maybe not <unk> to <unk>.
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still <unk>, and what does it have to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But perhaps it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you can't believe, <unk>, that the most <unk> of your being you have to yourself.
But you just <unk> that you have data in <unk> from a <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that you have to <unk> the other when you're finished.
And, you know, if we think it's all the way.
And so I started <unk>, and it's what I've been <unk> for several months during the <unk> <unk> that I was going to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> of my <unk> success.
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel like this is, not <unk>.
You don't <unk>. You're just <unk> your job.
<unk> to <unk> for your part, any can be.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, <unk> <unk> to you <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for just one moment through your <unk>, then "<unk>!" <unk>! "
<unk>, you're doing the same your <unk>.
And "<unk>!" You're going to do it.
I think it's <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk> "to you, even for <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk>: <unk>!
You know, as I've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome, what can <unk> and discovery of new genes.
Now we're <unk> a new <unk> here: we started <unk> our biology and now starting from that digital code, we're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always tried to <unk> big questions.
"What is life?" It's something that many <unk>, I think they're going to be able to understand at various levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to <unk> terms.
We're <unk> over 20 years now.
When we <unk> the human genome to <unk> from the <unk> world of biology to the computer biology world.
Now, what is we can <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> one even smaller.
We can <unk> a <unk> of genes about 500 than about 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than here.
But when we look at the <unk> map, it's <unk> simple than our.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at the time, it's very <unk> that can bring a <unk> cell.
So I thought that the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so we could <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of the "We can <unk> a <unk>?"
Can the <unk> chemistry of produce these big molecules that we've never been able to create before?
And, in case, can we make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material.
The speed we're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk>.
Our ability to write the code, instead, <unk> rather slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We've <unk> over 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> experiments.
But we found that DNA <unk> is very hard.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and it's a <unk> process. The <unk> is the <unk>, the <unk> is <unk>, the <unk> is <unk>.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, starting from information digital information genome of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a little virus that <unk> bacteria.
We designed the <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA about <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material and we <unk> it into the bacteria, bacteria have <unk> to read this <unk> code and <unk> the <unk> particles.
<unk> particles have been <unk> by cells, they're <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I've been talking about recently with members of the <unk> industry that they certainly <unk> this model.
They have more than you.
I think this is a situation where the software can actually build his <unk> in a <unk> system.
But we could do the biggest things in that.
We wanted to build the whole <unk> of <unk>.
They're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> code.
So we thought of <unk> in the <unk> of size, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell.
<unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> information in a computer, they need to be very <unk>.
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk> was in a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We've discovered, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If we were using that original sequence never <unk> that original <unk>.
One part of the process is to design <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> with all of the other <unk> <unk> to build smaller than <unk> together.
<unk> elements here.
You've probably read that <unk> us from <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: We have a <unk> code on four <unk>: A, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and there's a <unk> order for every <unk>.
So we can use the code for <unk> words, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did at the beginning was <unk>.
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started <unk> of parts, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
At every step, we've produced these <unk> in <unk> so that we're trying to create a very <unk> <unk>, as we're going to create a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
When we started these <unk> very <unk>, more than 100 <unk> <unk>, not <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> biology.
So we've <unk> some other <unk>.
We're going to <unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA that we can <unk> the <unk>.
Here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk>.
You can see the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk>.
In 12 -- 24 hours, it's <unk> exactly how it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can <unk> completely.
We're going to live under <unk>.
I'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and you're <unk> to find new <unk> of water <unk>.
Actually, NASA showed that this is happening.
This is a picture of the <unk> that we built using these <unk>, just using the <unk> with the <unk> design of <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's such a <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we've done a little time ago.
They're more than <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's the biggest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by the man.
It's got a <unk> <unk>.
If we're going to <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk>, we're just going to <unk> pages to <unk> this code.
Now, how do we work? How can we <unk> it?
Of course, of course, there's a <unk> <unk>.
It's a little bit more <unk> when you're using bacteria.
It's <unk> simple when it comes to the <unk> cells as our <unk>: you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is basically the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell, but we have <unk> <unk> that we're able to do a <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> cell to another and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> by a species.
<unk> are the two different <unk> men from <unk>.
We've <unk> some <unk> in a way that we could decide which is going to have a few <unk> in a way that we could decide which is going to be able to decide which is a few <unk> in a way that we could decide which is going to have to <unk>.
He <unk> it with <unk> so that they <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell.
And <unk> <unk> that we couldn't go beyond, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> <unk> to that species.
So who think about evolution as one <unk> at a time that <unk> has not <unk> a lot of biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that was in the cell, we didn't have one.
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk>, <unk> it, and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk>.
It's become blue because of the genes we've <unk>.
And in a short <unk> of time, all of the <unk> of a species have gone <unk>, and it <unk> of all of a new species, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, and the <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the code that we've <unk>.
Now, this may seem <unk> <unk>, but we <unk> the software, we can change things quite <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that there is not about <unk> -- but of progress starting three million years and a half years and a <unk> of evolution, and I already said that maybe we're going to create a new <unk> species on this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk>.
We're going to go for six and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Right to give one example: I was born in <unk>.
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in the <unk>; there's four years.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> for six billion people.
We're going to have to do it for nine billion billion.
<unk> more than five billion <unk>, more than 30 billion <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it's going to be a huge challenge.
We have to <unk> the whole <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere.
At the day, with the <unk> of <unk> around the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like think it's <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry only one <unk> about <unk>, and think of how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from the reality of the <unk> and our imagination.
Now we have <unk>, <unk> to these <unk> <unk> <unk>, able to create what we call the <unk> <unk>.
We can build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think about <unk> these 20 million genes or to try to <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, with a little team, and create more <unk> biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard <unk>.
We can <unk> to <unk> <unk>, chemistry or <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species on the computer.
Well, we don't know how they're going to be.
We know exactly what their code is.
Now we're going to <unk> on the next generation.
You've seen that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> as soon as soon as they <unk> as soon as they <unk> as <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that biology can be a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter before, so we're working to design cells that can reach that purpose, and we think we can get the first <unk> of <unk> generation in about 18 months.
<unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> of <unk>, but our <unk> of <unk> in the world, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we've <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the deep ocean, about <unk> feet deep at the temperature of <unk>.
We're <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2, which can easily be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So short, we think that we could be able to <unk> what life is, we <unk> the basic question, "What is life is, we, we <unk> the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole <unk> industry.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where can you?
We're going to have a <unk> of energy.
<unk>, we're working for the same <unk> to create <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we've always been back a year and with a dollar in less when it comes to find the <unk> right right.
I think that you can <unk> by building <unk> <unk>.
Here's how the future could start looking <unk>, now, the tree of evolution with bacteria <unk>, <unk> the evolution with bacteria <unk>, <unk> cells.
We are so much about <unk> people.
Our purpose is to do it in a way to <unk> it. Thank you very much.
First of all, I'm going to show you, the <unk> possible, some <unk> work, a new technology that we brought to <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk>.
It's a environment in which you can <unk> is at local level that you can <unk> a huge amount of data.
We're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a fast <unk>, <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big these data <unk>, how big these data <unk> or images.
Most of them are photographs, but this is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a book, data <unk>, of data not images.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And so we're just <unk> that's text and not of images, we can do something like this, to actually see that it's a real <unk> of the text <unk>, not a picture.
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a <unk> book.
I don't <unk>.
This is a more <unk> example. This is a number of <unk>.
Every big picture is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the <unk> and the beautiful experience of the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is a <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> kind of a <unk> kind of a half a <unk>.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of <unk>.
We've created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much higher than what you use in a normal <unk> and we've <unk> the <unk> content.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or some <unk>, or even the <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
We knew that this <unk> <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> like that, not <unk> to be <unk>.
Of course, <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this is not going to lose time, if not to say we have <unk> to <unk> from this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> above a NASA <unk>.
So now we're going to do something else.
This is actually actually live on the web; you can <unk> it.
This is a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> research computer computer very interesting <unk> made by <unk> <unk>, a student of <unk> in Washington, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive on the web, <unk> by <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of images here has actually a meaning.
The <unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> have <unk> these images together, so that they <unk> to the <unk> <unk> all close to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk>. Here you see some <unk> of a <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk>, and these things were all <unk> on the <unk> level.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are much more <unk>.
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that we've done for the first time, I <unk> to show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology, the <unk> technology. And it's not <unk> so <unk> <unk> the <unk> that we've put in the website.
We had to <unk> some <unk> and so forth.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> images from <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and <unk> images of the types of <unk> and so on. <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, they're all <unk> images from <unk> and you're all <unk> on the <unk> level like this.
And it's possible to <unk> in this <unk> way.
You know, I never would never be <unk> to work.
It's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think we're going to see that it's a lot of different kinds of <unk>: from those cell phones to the <unk> <unk>, a <unk> number, <unk>, <unk> number together in this environment.
And if I can, I can <unk> out and <unk> those <unk>.
There are a lot of <unk>, etc.
<unk> there is a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> to view of this environment.
The <unk> point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is <unk> data from the whole memory of <unk> as <unk> the earth, from the whole memory of <unk> and <unk> all of that data together.
All of those pictures become <unk>, more than the parts.
You have a whole model of the entire <unk>.
Think about this as the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on Earth.
It's something that's going to <unk> <unk> that people are <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk> with the use.
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> all of these <unk> <unk>, the name, my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of that data, and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space, in that <unk>, using the <unk> of anybody else, and have a social experience.
Of course, a <unk> of all of this is <unk> models that is extremely <unk> of every interesting part of the earth, <unk> not only by <unk> <unk> and <unk> images and similar, but from <unk>.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized? What does that your software <unk> us to do is that at some point, in the next few years, all the photographs <unk> from anybody in the world all of the <unk> together?
<unk>: Yes. What is doing is actually <unk>.
It's <unk> by <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's doing it on the content of images.
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about <unk> information that many of these <unk> images.
As you do a <unk> of images on the web, you <unk> a <unk> and the page on the web has a lot of information about images.
Now, what happens if that picture is <unk> to all your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that's <unk> is really enormous. It's a <unk> effect.
CA: <unk>, it's really incredible. <unk>.
<unk>: I'm going to <unk>.
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that that we can live in the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> of plants.
You might think that <unk> <unk> <unk> even beyond the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and that the idea that the world we live in in <unk>, to remember the <unk> <unk> of <unk>, and that the idea that the world we live in a <unk> sense, but it's only a reality model, but it's just a <unk> of reality,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done, or bad, a lot of <unk> it.
And, of course, everybody <unk> <unk>.
Everybody <unk>. Everybody <unk>.
We're <unk> <unk>.
We need to <unk> the death <unk>, so we don't know if we <unk> and <unk>.
We all have a art.
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song, the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they're the <unk> of <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the heart of <unk>.
He was my <unk> <unk> in <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> <unk>'s <unk>'s <unk>.
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of to think, other ways of moving around the world.
And, if you <unk> a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of the world <unk> create a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and is important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk>.
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk>, dreams, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as <unk> species.
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> to <unk> and <unk> much faster.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk> simply because it's <unk>, or -- in the <unk> of <unk> diversity -- and you don't even <unk> to <unk> <unk> -- that's not <unk> <unk> -- that's the <unk> of diversity.
The <unk> of all of this is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A language is not <unk> only from a <unk> or a series of <unk> rules.
One is the <unk> of the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the middle of which the <unk> of every culture is coming in in the material world.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we are here in <unk>, at least half is not <unk> in the <unk> of children's <unk>.
They're not <unk> to children, which means less than <unk> something, which is already death.
What's more <unk> than being <unk> by the <unk>, of being the last one of the language, not to <unk> the language of <unk>?
This <unk> <unk> has been the <unk> of somebody in the world's <unk>. Every two weeks, a <unk> <unk> and <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know that somebody of you know, "<unk>'t it much better?
The world would not be a better place if we <unk> all the same language? "<unk>, then we're talking about <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> of a <unk> thing means not to talk about their own language.
And I'd like to make you a journey through the <unk> --
a little trip to <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us <unk> that when I say, "" I really mean, "I really mean a different way of <unk>.
So, for example, this <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, which <unk> to <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that's not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> of the forest, which <unk> the <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule, <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>": you have to <unk> a different language.
All of this has been <unk> in <unk>, though the <unk> is that in these <unk> families that they're talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> no <unk> language.
You're going to listen and then <unk> to talk.
And I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived in, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
They did <unk> by photographs that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> <unk> forest <unk> had never seen anything <unk>.
They <unk> the picture of land, they <unk> it to <unk> a form or a <unk> and, not <unk>, <unk> nothing, they <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk>.
But <unk> don't just <unk> the <unk>.
It's <unk> between them.
<unk> percent of <unk> was <unk> by themselves.
We came to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> and found two <unk> of death and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was so that he died <unk>, and then <unk> it <unk> it. And so, they <unk> it was <unk> knowledge of it.
<unk> could recognize the <unk> animal from 40 <unk> and to <unk> species.
<unk> years old, it was <unk> a very interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> between <unk> society at the basis of <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
For a sense of <unk>, I should have to understand the <unk> culture, and the <unk> is not <unk> <unk>.
It's pretty much about a <unk> view of the world.
Very interesting.
If you're going to <unk> the <unk> of the world's great <unk>, what would I <unk>?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent has always been left out, thinking that <unk> Africa has not <unk> <unk>. And instead of <unk> is not anything that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes interesting about the <unk> is the <unk> relationship between life and death.
So <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the live in so that for a short moment the <unk> becomes the <unk>.
So, in fact, in the <unk> <unk> go to talk about God.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And since you're <unk>, is the spirit that you're <unk>, how can you <unk>?
So, you're <unk> to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a pretty strong <unk> of the power of the mind when it's <unk> in a <unk> state of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> all the <unk> that I've lived the <unk> <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a blood continent <unk>, this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk>.
In <unk>, I've been <unk> by a <unk>, but their education is extraordinary.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> away from <unk> to <unk> <unk>, and they live live in a world <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years.
Two <unk> <unk> <unk>.
For all this time, they're <unk> to <unk> values that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk>.
At the <unk> of this incredible <unk>, they're <unk> <unk> out and for the first time in their lives, they see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk>, everything that they've learned in the <unk> <unk> <unk>, everything that they've learned in the <unk> <unk>. The <unk> does a <unk> <unk>. <unk> does a <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>? <unk> as I said.
It's <unk>. Now it's at you <unk>. "
They call <unk> <unk> and they say that we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world's <unk>.
This <unk> level is extremely important.
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> to the Earth.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk>.
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>, but <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, but <unk>, <unk>, created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk> on the concept of <unk> <unk> <unk>. But a <unk> <unk> <unk>, the concept that the Earth can only live because it is <unk> by the human <unk>.
What does that mean?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> its <unk> is going to be <unk> different. And it's going to be <unk> different with the mountain or the <unk> of <unk> that a mountain <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
which is the <unk> of a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
That made me a human being <unk> by my <unk> friends that <unk> are <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk>.
If we can <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different <unk>, we could start to understand some of them <unk>. We're going to be this <unk>.
I <unk> this picture in <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you've heard about the <unk>, the most powerful <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the <unk> potential of <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On one hand, this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> has a <unk> that <unk> a little bit that <unk>, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>'s family <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you're going to see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk>, the <unk> that's <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. It doesn't create a <unk> of reality; it creates the <unk> of reality.
I often <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with his <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> to my <unk> you can't <unk> these <unk> as a <unk>, because if you can't tell anybody to be <unk>. <unk> <unk>, but they can't be <unk> because they're <unk> by a <unk> that's <unk>, of course, in <unk> <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> only if we <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk> is the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk>, the same kind of necessary to <unk> the <unk>. <unk> question: in a <unk> of plants, how these <unk> <unk> <unk>, how these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, they make these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if we <unk> <unk>, we <unk> "<unk> talk about it."
What does that mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, who <unk> <unk> in the forest, and our eyes <unk> in the forest, and our eyes <unk> in the same species.
If they <unk> them as they <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>" <unk> "<unk>" -- "No."
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> in a night night, <unk> <unk> <unk> with a different <unk>.
And with this is not <unk> to <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk> <unk>.
Now, the problem is that even those of us who have heart <unk> <unk> them, but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of the history of the real world's history, and <unk> it goes beyond.
In fact, the <unk> century, in 300 years, not <unk> <unk> <unk> or its <unk> <unk>, but rather as the was that we <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the diversity and <unk> and <unk> the planet's mass <unk> of the <unk> diversity and <unk> and <unk> of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> don't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put up <unk> and <unk> as they <unk> don't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put up <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the technology or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And if you look at the world, we're not <unk> that these are not <unk> <unk>.
They are <unk> and <unk> <unk> from the existence of <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> capacity.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has been <unk> in the forest to a generation of <unk>, and now <unk> to the <unk> <unk>, and we're going to <unk> <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>,
We started <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in <unk>, are disease that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery.
If we're going to <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> <unk> of politics.
As a <unk>, the <unk> physics of a <unk>, is <unk> at the <unk> level, but the <unk>, the <unk> of life <unk>, not only is not <unk>, but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's part of the development <unk>.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you go away from the beginning.
I've got the <unk> miles from <unk> in the Western <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only <unk> to <unk>, I realized what's going on.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
which means that it's been <unk> at the time of the Chinese <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that brought the <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk>.
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at age age two <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn't have live without him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>, for this <unk>, was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> pain of <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
At the end, everything is <unk> to a choice.
How do we live in the <unk> world, or we want to <unk> the world's <unk> of diversity?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk>, before he died said that his biggest fear was that was that, in our <unk> to this <unk> view of the world, not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of thinking, but a day we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> years old.
<unk> <unk>, who gave us agriculture, which has <unk> us, that <unk> us to <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
<unk> <unk> world has <unk> 300 years.
That <unk> story I didn't know that we have the answers to all the challenges that we could <unk> in the <unk>.
When these <unk> <unk> of <unk> the world is asked what it means to be human, we're going to be human, we're <unk> with <unk> <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibilities of being, sort of <unk>, which has to make all <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there's great moments of <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the north of <unk> <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and this man, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The <unk> government wasn't always <unk> with <unk> <unk> and in the '<unk> to <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man is <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, family, <unk> for his life, <unk> all the <unk>, and all of his <unk>.
You should know that <unk> don't <unk> the cold, we're going to be <unk>.
<unk> <unk> were made of fish <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> from night or <unk>.
It's <unk> away, it <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand. When I did it <unk> it, he <unk> it <unk>, he <unk> it <unk> it up, he <unk> it up and he <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> a <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> to talk about <unk>? [[<unk>] and that, in different ways, [<unk>] is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> the government <unk> <unk> to <unk> the total area of an area of <unk> bigger <unk> in California and <unk> together.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. We <unk> all the <unk> resources.
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, finally, I think it's pretty <unk> at least at the <unk> of us has been in these <unk> areas of the planet, we realized that it's not <unk> at all.
For somebody is home.
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that we <unk> to the <unk> of the time. And for all of us, the dreams of our children, as they become part of the <unk> of hope.
And so, we <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> never <unk>.
I <unk> <unk> --
<unk> are not <unk>, but we think stories can change the world, and perhaps we're the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our job is <unk> in <unk> to <unk> our public in <unk> <unk>, and we have to <unk> <unk> from which <unk> away from <unk> how they saw and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and we have to find a <unk> <unk> <unk> in a world and we need to find a <unk> <unk> world.
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I've written in this book that I hope is you've already heard and <unk> some <unk>, in case you don't <unk> them.
I'd like to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk>."
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens." The way to do that is <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. "
The reason is, on one side, in fact that the freedom is in itself, it's <unk>, it's useful, <unk>, <unk> for humans.
On the other one is in fact that if we're <unk>, each of us can act to do everything that we <unk> our <unk>, without no one that we're going to <unk> our <unk>.
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk>.
More choices people, more <unk> are, and more choices is their freedom, the <unk>, the higher one of their <unk>.
This is <unk> <unk>, <unk>, in a society that nobody <unk> to <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I <unk> a simple <unk> on the <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there's <unk> <unk>, without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that nobody of <unk> already in your <unk> <unk> that nobody's already <unk> your <unk>.
Here's how the <unk>.
Then you go to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk>, <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> store, there's a lot of <unk>.
We can do six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are only a store.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk>.
<unk>: the world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a child, you could get all the <unk> <unk>, to <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
You <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
One <unk> of that, between the other, was that the phone <unk> never.
These are gone.
We now have a <unk> <unk> <unk>, especially between phones.
Here is cell phones from the future.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you don't have the <unk> yet, you're <unk> that soon as you're <unk>.
And what happens is that people <unk> into the <unk> and does this question. And you know, what is the answer? The answer is, "No."
You can't buy a mobile phone that doesn't <unk>.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk>, they're <unk> the same <unk> of choices.
<unk>: It's not going to be in the United States that you're going to go from <unk> and the <unk> you what you have to do.
Instead, we're going to go from <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we could do it. Or, we could <unk>," A, "or <unk>," A, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>. What do you want to do?"
You <unk> him: "<unk>, what do you want to do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you said, "<unk> if she was me, what did I mean?"
And the <unk> said, "But I'm not her."
And the result, we call the <unk> <unk>, <unk> that makes it look look like a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not a <unk> the <unk> and the responsibility of making decisions from someone knows something, <unk> the <unk>, to <unk> the <unk>, to <unk> something that doesn't know -- and it's certainly <unk> -- and so it's not about <unk> to make the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk>, <unk> to people like me and you, if you think about it doesn't make sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why we can't we <unk> them?
The answer is that they want you to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> so fundamental as it is our <unk> now is a question of choice, how you see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> kids. We don't want to <unk> the <unk>." We don't <unk> a <unk> <unk>. We have to <unk> it.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
which means that every <unk>, you have to decide that kind of person you want to be.
We <unk> to the family and <unk>, a common time perspective, <unk> almost for anyone, was that there was that <unk> the <unk> as possible, and they <unk> to <unk> the as possible.
The only real choice was with people, not when, and even what to do after.
<unk>, it's really to play.
We're going to be very smart, and they <unk> the 20 percent of work on a time.
And not because they're not <unk>, not because they're less <unk>.
But why they're <unk>, <unk>, "<unk> <unk> or not?"
"<unk> <unk>." <unk>. "<unk> <unk>."
They're <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even though this <unk> doesn't get the <unk> that <unk> and not get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk>.
And they really need to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work is <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, because technology allows us to work every minute, every day, every day, every <unk> of the planet, <unk> that's <unk> from the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I'm not going to tell anybody, where the <unk> works.
I don't tell you, because I want to use it.
What does this incredible, this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the job? That we need to decide, <unk> at any time, if we need to work or not.
We can go to see our son to play <unk>, with the <unk> in a <unk>, the other way, and the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And even though they're all <unk>, every minute we see our son, we're also <unk>, "I've got to <unk>," <unk> to this call? "
"<unk> I have to <unk> this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And even when the answer is, "not," it's all of your <unk> son very different than what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of us, we look at, little objects and <unk>, life is a question of choices.
One time the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibilities, but not everything was about choice.
The world today's going to <unk> this: <unk> is, "Is it <unk>, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
<unk> <unk> we know we all know, so I'm going to talk about <unk>.
We're going to have this choice is two effects of people.
The first one, <unk>, is that it <unk> instead of <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> between which you have to be very hard to do.
I'll give you an example of <unk>: a <unk> study on <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> has <unk> access to the <unk> data, the <unk> <unk> <unk>'s <unk>, with about a million <unk> <unk> in different companies.
What she found was that for every 10 solutions that are <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
With 50 <unk>, there's 10 percent less than when they're only available to be five. Why is it available.
Because with 50 <unk> between which you have to <unk>, and <unk> is <unk> <unk>.
And <unk>, and still <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk> <unk> never comes.
<unk> that doesn't mean just means that these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don't have enough money, it means that the decision is so <unk> that you can also <unk> the decision is so <unk> that we also <unk> the decision <unk> of work.
They're not <unk>, they're <unk> to <unk> <unk> for year from work, which would be well <unk> to <unk>.
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices.
And I think we're going to be the world.
"And finally, to end up, <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
You're just going to be the right decision, if it is the <unk>, isn't it?
You don't want to choose the wrong <unk>, and <unk> the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice, at the end, we're less <unk> from the result of how we <unk> <unk> from.
And that's why we're going to be different reasons.
One of them is that with many <unk> of which is that <unk>, is not perfect, it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you could have been done a different choice. And what's happening is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> of choice, and the <unk> <unk> by <unk>,
even when it was a <unk> decision.
<unk> choices there are, it's easier to <unk> than <unk>.
<unk>, there is what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> as the value that we give things to things that we give things that we <unk>.
<unk> rest, when there are a lot of <unk> possible, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and being less than the <unk> <unk>.
Here's an example. I <unk> with everyone that's not in New York City.
But that's probably <unk>.
There's this <unk> <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk>. <unk> day. It's all about it.
<unk> nothing. But what he thinks is, "Well, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are away."
"<unk> <unk> right in front of home."
And it goes two weeks, we're going to go to -- every day -- the chance to <unk> where it wants.
<unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when the choice was <unk>.
And the more are the <unk> that we have <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about living the moment, and perhaps life as slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you're going to be, you're going to be <unk>,
The things that don't know many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>.
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk>.
It's going to be <unk>.
Once the <unk> were just like, we <unk> them and <unk> <unk>, were <unk>, only after <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> of life and <unk> a lot of times, I started to go well.
So, I started <unk> a couple of <unk> when the <unk> <unk>, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
The <unk> said, "<unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
Do them want to <unk> or <unk>? "
"Do them want to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> them wants to <unk> or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after some of it, and he was <unk>, "I want the <unk> guy that was the only guy." He had no idea what was, so for a time, I <unk> all of <unk> <unk>, then I <unk> all of <unk> <unk> that I had ever had.
It was the <unk>. With all that choice had <unk> the best.
But it <unk> me.
Why? I wrote a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
At the beginning I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't <unk> anything about <unk> when I only had a guy. But when I had 100 different, it had to be a perfect <unk>.
And what I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After I <unk> that we <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the lives of people don't do that <unk> the <unk> that these are <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>.
And this <unk> <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk> <unk>.
Because if you <unk> it, I'm not going to talk about it.
The truth is more to this.
"It was better when you were worse," The reason why he was was even even when he was worse was when he was worse was possible to <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world we live in -- <unk>, <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to the <unk>.
You've never been <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>" Yes, "<unk> <unk>."
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- that I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I didn't <unk>.
But <unk> not always is a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there is just that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you're not <unk>, and you're <unk> "?"
"Who is <unk>?" <unk>, "the answer is <unk>.
The world is <unk>. What could I do?
When you have hundreds of <unk>, and you're going to <unk> a <unk>, and you'll <unk> who is the <unk>, it's clear that the <unk> is <unk>.
You could have done better.
With hundreds of <unk> <unk>, there are not <unk> for <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even if the result is <unk>, they're <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> them.
In the last few years, it's <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is just that people have <unk> experiences because the standard are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think that <unk> is them.
So the <unk> result is that we're in general, we're better, we're going to get worse.
Let me show you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we're going to take for it and it's completely <unk>.
There is no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all, but it doesn't <unk> that much choice is better than <unk>.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we've been <unk> by a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our lives.
Now, from a <unk>'s point of view -- I almost finished -- from a <unk> point of view, <unk> is the <unk>.
What allows all of this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you're <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice.
The problem is that they have too <unk>.
So the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> society.
And what <unk> and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you've talked to you yesterday about how much those <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, is not that they're just <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk>.
They're worse.
If a little bit of what in our society <unk> <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people have too few possibilities, it would not just be their life to <unk>. But also, it's our lives.
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of income does good at all -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we're <unk>.
And so, you can become everything you want to be --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>, "What's going to <unk> that fish?"
"It's <unk> that you can't make anything in a glass <unk>."
"A <unk> imagination, a <unk> view of the world --
and I <unk> it like this, at the beginning.
But then, <unk>, instead, I realized that that the fish knows it's long.
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk>, so that "everything is possible," you can't <unk> the freedom.
If you <unk> the <unk> so that it's all possible to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
Everybody needs a <unk>.
This is almost certainly too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and, <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you very much heart.
