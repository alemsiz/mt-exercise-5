You can see that the <unk> <unk>, of five or more, it's like the <unk>, which here <unk> from body.
In 25 years is <unk>, so it's like.
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> in the ocean <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, they're <unk> in <unk> <unk>.

One reason that's this <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk>.
This is a <unk> river in <unk>.
The <unk> never <unk> <unk>.

The <unk> <unk> in the world, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the <unk> and without <unk>.
<unk> times in the last 30 years of the <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the <unk>.
If you look at the <unk>, if you can see the <unk>.
In the last five years we've <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> every day. <unk> million <unk> in every day.

And every way, there's a <unk> <unk> in our country.
The <unk> of the <unk> and the oil <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year for <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.

<unk>: So the <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk> has <unk> two <unk>.
This is a <unk> of them, a part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> <unk> to our <unk>.
So our <unk> is <unk> a big <unk> of money in a <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> and <unk> the truth.
In fact, the <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it's also a good <unk>.
So we don't <unk> of change.
We do it.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> -- you know, you know, you know.
So, I <unk> a <unk> <unk> to a <unk> for how to <unk>.
<unk>! The machines are a little bit of <unk>, but this is the sound of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the

Thank you very much.
The last year I did a <unk> on <unk>.
And we <unk> to <unk> <unk> on how it works.
So here. And for those who's the other time, there were, the <unk> is the most <unk> of <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
All of all that's just <unk>.
This is the car <unk>.
We <unk> these <unk> <unk>.
This is what I work. It's called <unk> -- is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a picture of <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
The 10 <unk> of the last year we've <unk> the first time.
And this picture was <unk> from <unk>.
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
It's a picture of the first <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with a part of <unk>, and <unk> <unk> the <unk>.
In other words, when you <unk> that the picture of 10 <unk>, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if I know if I was to <unk> <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> that the <unk> was this.
That means that we've got a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And in a week later, there was a problem with the car, it was a problem with these <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works in the <unk> of <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you <unk> <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, "It's not true."
And instead can do it because when they are very <unk> <unk>.
So, in <unk> <unk> <unk>, to a <unk> <unk> that of space between the space, these <unk> can bring that.
In one of the <unk> between the most of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, there was a <unk> of <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is more <unk> <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and that are <unk> of about 30 <unk>.
They are <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what then then we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
We're <unk> all at all of them.
And the end of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, and we <unk> to <unk> data to <unk> or <unk>, and <unk>, and we <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, and we <unk> to find that <unk> the <unk>.
Now, of course, in a way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and <unk>. And it's easy to <unk>.
I think the fact that is so hard, the fact that is so hard to go to the <unk>, I think it's the <unk>.
I'd like to <unk> with the words of a <unk>, which, which, <unk>, <unk>, his <unk> <unk>, his <unk> was <unk>, his <unk> was <unk>, he said, "No," No, he said, "No <unk> to human mind as <unk>.
Thank you.
I want to <unk> <unk> to <unk> when, they <unk>, <unk> with <unk>.
And as <unk> as <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, actually, in fact, in fact, <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> <unk>.
So, from <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk>, and I started <unk>, and then, when a computer <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
and we <unk> to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer.
You can <unk> them with the hand, they can <unk>, and they're <unk> with them, and a <unk> <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, as <unk>, you can just <unk>.
The <unk> is the example of a new <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> the information.
And they're <unk>, as as a <unk> movement, <unk> <unk>, other, other, other <unk>, <unk> that's <unk>, of the <unk>, of the <unk>, we can <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> for the video: if you're going to show it in a <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, if we <unk> the other <unk>.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> of other other.
If you <unk>, you're <unk> to what they're going to be around.
If they're <unk>, they're <unk> and <unk>, and they can <unk> it.
If they're <unk>, they're <unk> and <unk>, and they can <unk> it.
We also also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We're <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> of the data, to <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> a color of how if it was a <unk>.
In this case, we three <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
and I can <unk> for <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, where you can <unk>.
If you're too too, we can <unk> a little bit to be a bit of the place.
And I'm also <unk> to <unk>, like <unk>, the <unk>, and and <unk> of <unk> where people can try and <unk> things, and <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
Now I'm --
This is a <unk> of <unk> that I do with a program of <unk>.
We have a game of the <unk> that is to half between <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, at every <unk> <unk> a <unk>, <unk> a <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and as <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And then, about 30 seconds, and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> to <unk>.
Thank you.
Here's the children <unk> in <unk> <unk>, I did that I did it in the way that I <unk> and <unk> a video.
They are very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things of this <unk> is that that's not to people.
I just say, "<unk> of the words, and they know what to do.
Here's other people who's <unk>.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In fact, it's just <unk>.
They just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is an <unk> <unk>.
And it's <unk> to build a <unk> for the <unk>.
It can <unk> new <unk> in the <unk>, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new <unk> in the <unk>, <unk> their <unk>.
So, it's doing it.
<unk>: The <unk> is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now, he has a <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work!
So, <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk>, and you know, and you can understand how it's <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk>, and you know, and you can understand how it's <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have the time that I have the time to show you a <unk>, for <unk> and <unk> music.
It's a <unk>, <unk> <unk>, for <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> <unk> here from <unk> as the <unk>, and the <unk>.
And they're four <unk> <unk>, and you can <unk> them.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk>.
And I just just do <unk> a sound, "I just <unk> a <unk>."
These are actually that you can <unk> from <unk>, as the <unk> and the <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> a particular <unk> and then <unk> for <unk>.
And then there are the fact, as time and <unk>, which is <unk> to the entire <unk>.
<unk> like it works.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> in two <unk> <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk>, the other <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
Now, <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: Now, <unk> <unk> --
<unk>: <unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk>, so I can <unk> the <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a side of a side of the other or another.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the <unk>. "
So I don't have to <unk> before, I can <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And now, I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> <unk> on the left <unk>. "
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
And today, I've been time to show you one of this <unk>, and also some of this <unk>, and also some of the lab.
And the concept I want to <unk> is that's <unk> this new generation of objects <unk> with the <unk> <unk>, which we're going to be <unk>.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the right now with all of you.
I'm a <unk>.
And I'm more to my <unk>, but it's more than this, of course.
It's also the <unk> and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't know what can change.
But, I said, that, something particular of this life and my life and my career, who has me to <unk> the entire <unk> with this work.
The particular thing is that I <unk> <unk> this book, this book called <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "The <unk>, which, I <unk>, I'm going to be a big <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that <unk> now, people are now, people like if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to be now, and they say, "You don't know, I don't want to do better?
You don't know that to <unk> all the life without <unk>? "
What can you say? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could be <unk>, I'm going to be more than 20 years ago, when I was a <unk>.
It's <unk> to the same <unk>.
And people said, "I said," I don't have to be <unk>?
You don't know that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>?
You don't know that <unk> to do that <unk> for all the life without nothing to <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> of <unk> <unk>?
So, you know,
The answer -- the next answer to all these questions is, "
And I'm sure of all those things.
I've always always always <unk>.
And I also have to <unk> many other things that people can't be <unk>.
As the <unk> and other things.
But, as I'm going to say what I was and <unk> <unk> is why?
Is it it?
It's <unk> who who <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> from a job that was <unk> for a job.
But what's so particular of this particular <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk>, they're not going to do it?
How my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I don't know about one time in the 40 years of <unk>, where they were asked if they were <unk>?
And there was never -- that <unk> <unk> <unk>, how do it?
You don't know, <unk>?
<unk>, the <unk> <unk>, as they don't know, in <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not only <unk>, but <unk> of any <unk>, we have this <unk> of being <unk>.
And not else that look at at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, <unk>, <unk> and often often for them.
And even those who are not <unk> to be <unk> from their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before I was <unk>, in the last <unk> said, "Every book," Every <unk> a little bit more <unk> of their life.
But I don't <unk> when you're going to say because we heard these things so so long, we've <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that of <unk> and <unk> are in some way and <unk> and <unk> that art and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> all here is: you're going to be <unk> with this idea?
And it's well what -- because it's also <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of me not well for this <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's <unk> and I don't want to <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better <unk> our <unk>.
And I know that, in my case -- in my case -- it would be very <unk> to <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> in my career.
<unk> -- look at, I'm pretty young, I've been young, about 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that any <unk> now in the world, then it's going to be <unk> from my <unk> world as the <unk> of my last <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, because we all more or less to the <unk> here -- is that my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, who <unk>!
You know that, that <unk> <unk> that <unk> a person to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to go to <unk>. And I don't want to do it.
I'm going to do this work.
So, the question is, how?
And so so, so I'm going to be, which the way to work to <unk> and <unk>, OK?
I've been in some way to find a <unk>, and my <unk>, and my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> to <unk> all the last year of how to look at the year, and then then, and find more <unk> to find them to find more and more ideas to find more ideas to see, and <unk> and <unk> ideas to see if you have more ideas to <unk>.
how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And that <unk> me to <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> because they <unk> in <unk> and then <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- people don't believe that the <unk> of <unk>, OK?
It's <unk> that human <unk> was this <unk> <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, for <unk>, for <unk>, for <unk> and <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>. "
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> were the same idea, but <unk> that species of the <unk>.
The <unk> that is <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really know that a <unk> was a <unk>.
And I think a <unk> was this species of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. And I was a artist in a artist, a little bit like <unk> <unk>, and <unk> out of <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> of the work of that work.
<unk> <unk> here, that's the <unk> <unk> that -- that's the <unk> <unk> that -- that's the <unk> of your work.
And all of that was so that <unk>, right?
So, we <unk> <unk> things, like to <unk> things, like to the <unk>, no?
If your work was <unk> <unk>. <unk> all the <unk>, all <unk> that <unk> was <unk> by this <unk> <unk>.
If your work, it was not all <unk> your work, right?
All of your <unk> <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk>.
And then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk>, and <unk> this great idea; we put the human <unk> in the universe, all of the universe, and they <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>.
This was the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and people to think that the <unk> of <unk>.
And for the first time in the story, you're <unk> to <unk> this or that <unk> as a <unk> <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think that was a big <unk>.
I think I would be <unk> to someone, a simple person to be like a <unk>, and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's like to somebody of somebody <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> all these <unk> <unk>.
And I think it's been this <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think it's, the question, and now?
Can we do it?
We go back to a more <unk> <unk> of the <unk> between human <unk> and <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> it <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And there's probably people between the audience that <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, <unk>, you know, you know, people <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
You don't <unk> to <unk> all about this.
But the question I want to <unk> is -- why?
Why don't you think that?
Because it's more than any other other thing that's ever heard for <unk> <unk>.
One process, as everybody who has ever <unk> to do something -- so, all here -- so, everybody -- it's not, you know, you know, it's not <unk>.
And, in fact, it can be completely <unk>.
I did this <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which has been a <unk> <unk>, but that's a <unk> for all the <unk> and said that in his life and said that in his <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I was like a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> to her <unk>.
I <unk> it, because he was <unk> the Earth's <unk>.
And I'm going to be one thing to do that that point and it was, his <unk>, his <unk>. "
And so I was going to <unk> from this <unk>, and it didn't have to make another <unk> that to make a piece of paper and a <unk>, as <unk>, as <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> on the <unk>.
<unk> times, not <unk> to be enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without <unk> and <unk> without <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and she would <unk> to <unk> through the <unk> and <unk>, and she would be <unk>, and how she said, "<unk>."
And then there were those times -- this piece never -- there were the <unk>. And there were <unk>, OK?
So, he was <unk> to home and he was trying to <unk> the <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk>, and he said, and then he said, and then he was like if you know, and then he was like if you <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> in his body and <unk> on the <unk>.
And in these <unk>, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk>, and <unk> to the last <unk>, from the last last <unk>.
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it's exactly <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my process.
I don't all my process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way to <unk> is; it's <unk> to the same <unk> every day and work and <unk> on the same <unk>.
But even I, in my <unk>, I <unk> with that, I <unk> with that, and times.
And I think that we're <unk> for you the fact.
You know, if the work and the ideas and the ideas I could be <unk>.
And what is what?
And how we can we <unk> it in it way to do it, but it's pretty, you know, we do it?
So how I'm going to be the best example that I have is the <unk> <unk>, which I <unk> different years ago for a <unk>.
And I'm talking about this, and you know, for the <unk> of life was the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then, you know, <unk>, and a day as he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> all for him.
And I'm going to be <unk> and a <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> of <unk>, which is <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, but it's not like <unk>.
It's no piece of paper, it's not a <unk>, it's not a <unk>.
So I'm going to feel this species of <unk> <unk> in him, "I'm going to <unk>, and <unk> <unk> from this <unk>.
I'm not enough to <unk> and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of go in <unk>, <unk>.
We have the entire process and <unk> something new.
You know the sky and said, "<unk>, you know, you know, I'm <unk>?"
"You're going to say that you can look at a song?
If you really want to <unk>, you're going to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his process <unk> <unk> after this.
I don't work, the work was still <unk> as always like.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that was <unk> when he was <unk> when he was <unk> when he <unk> out of him, the <unk> that's out, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk>.
but I'm going to be <unk>, <unk> a <unk> <unk> and this thing, and <unk> that's not <unk>.
So how much story to change that story to change a little bit of <unk>, and I <unk> me and I've been <unk> and me.
This idea, I was when I was <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "and <unk> in a <unk> of those <unk> that we're working on on something and not on something that's going to think about something that's going to be a <unk>, and we're going to be a book.
Not just <unk>, just the <unk> <unk>.
And I think about <unk> that project.
But then I <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
So I <unk> my <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room.
And I said, "<unk>," <unk>, what, I know if this book, I'm going to be <unk> <unk> my <unk>, no?
Because how you see I'm <unk> all that I'm <unk>, I don't have more than this.
So if you want you to <unk> and you want to do your part.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what, I don't do it.
I'm going to <unk> it because it's my work.
And I want to say that I'd like to do my part of my part of my part, "Why is -- to the end is so, in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk> <unk> and <unk> to <unk> hours and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> hours and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> hours.
And they always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every much, <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> <unk> in fact, actually <unk>.
And I know you know what I know, because I know, I know, as a <unk> point, a <unk> <unk>.
It was like if the time, and the <unk> <unk> through a species of <unk> and a species of <unk> and it was doing anything of the <unk>, as the <unk> <unk>, but all <unk>.
And at all of the <unk> not only as a human.
But it's <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
And when this <unk>, to the time, people who was, and the <unk> with his name.
And I <unk> the hands and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God, God," God. "
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> this <unk>, <unk> this <unk> with them and their <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>, and <unk>, and you can see it.
In <unk>, when a artist has done something to be something something to <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's because we need.
But, the problem is the day later, for the same time, when you <unk> and <unk> that are the <unk> and <unk> <unk>. And they're the <unk> of <unk> and <unk>.
It's just a <unk> with <unk>, and maybe maybe <unk>, and maybe maybe you've never <unk> to that <unk> <unk>.
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God, as you know, and what is to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But maybe it's not to be so <unk> if you're not <unk>, <unk>, which the most <unk> of your own <unk> are from you.
But I just just just that's <unk> data in <unk> from a <unk> of your life that part of your life that's <unk>, and you have to <unk>.
And, you know, if the think that's all the way.
And so I started <unk>, and it's <unk> as I <unk> for different months in the <unk> of the book that <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> my <unk>.
And what I have to <unk> when I feel with this is, I feel for this is, I'm not <unk>.
<unk>. I don't just <unk> your work.
And I <unk> to <unk> your part, any of your <unk>.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If you <unk>, <unk> <unk> to you <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, for a moment through your <unk>, then your <unk>! "<unk>!" <unk>! "
<unk>, you do it same <unk>.
And "<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>.
I think and I think it's <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk> to you. It's just for <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
As you know I've talked about some of these projects on the human <unk>, and that's <unk> of new <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
Now we're <unk> a new <unk>: we're going to <unk> the <unk>, and now now we're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always tried to <unk> <unk>,
"<unk> is the life?" It's something that many <unk> I think they're <unk> to understand.
We've tried different <unk>, <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
We're <unk> from almost 20 years.
When we <unk> the human <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> the world of biology in the world of our computer.
Now we <unk>: We can <unk> life, or create new life from this universe?
This is the map of a <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the species of the <unk> <unk>, which can <unk> in the lab.
And we tried to <unk> <unk> the <unk> for <unk> a <unk>.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
But when we <unk> to the <unk> <unk>, is <unk> <unk>, is <unk> <unk> to our <unk>.
<unk>, that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, a <unk> that this can take a <unk>.
So, I think the only <unk> <unk> was <unk> this <unk> in <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> for some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of the "We can <unk> a <unk>?"
Can you the <unk> <unk> of these great <unk> that we never've never been able to create before you?
And in case, we can make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that we're able to <unk> life is <unk>.
Our ability to <unk> the <unk> <unk>, instead, instead, <unk> <unk>, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We've <unk> more than 15 years ago.
The process has a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> before <unk>.
But we found that <unk> of the DNA is very hard.
There are <unk> of thousands of <unk> machines that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> of DNA, <unk> <unk> and a process of 30 <unk> and a process, the <unk> is the <unk>, there's <unk>, more <unk>.
So we had to create a new <unk> for <unk> these <unk> and <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, to <unk> information, to <unk> information.
It's a little <unk> that <unk>.
We <unk> the <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
The interesting is when we've got this piece of <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in the <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> from cells, they're <unk> from cells, and they <unk> <unk>.
I talked about the <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have been <unk> with this model.
They <unk> more than you.
And that's a <unk> that is a <unk> that the software can actually build its own own <unk>.
But I'll do the most things in the big.
We're going to build the entire <unk>.
I'm more than <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought of <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>, so that we can change the <unk> for what are the <unk> of a <unk>.
The <unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> <unk> information in a computer, these are very <unk>.
When we <unk> this <unk> for the first time in the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> <unk> for 10 <unk>.
We found, <unk>, 30. If you're <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>.
One of the process is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with all other <unk> of 50 <unk> <unk> to build more <unk> <unk>.
We're <unk> <unk> here.
You know, you know that we're <unk> <unk>.
<unk> so: we have a <unk> <unk> <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
And we <unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk>, and there's a <unk> <unk> of <unk> for every <unk>.
So we can use the <unk> <unk> for <unk>, <unk>.
What we did it at the beginning was <unk>.
Some of the fact that it was not <unk>.
We <unk> these <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk>.
There are <unk> that they <unk> and <unk> them.
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> from five <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In every step, we've got this <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk>, and we're <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> as you see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems the <unk> of a <unk>.
When we're going to <unk> these <unk> very <unk>, <unk> <unk>, not more than 100 <unk>.
It's <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of biology.
So we've <unk> to other <unk>.
And we're going to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is in our <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> the <unk>.
Here's a example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> <unk>.
In 12 hours is <unk>. It's just like that.
<unk> thousands of these <unk> who are able to do it.
These are <unk>.
We live in <unk>.
I'm sure that life <unk> in space, and you get to find new <unk> <unk> of water.
And the real, the <unk> <unk> has <unk>.
This is a picture of the <unk> that we've built using these <unk>, using the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> them.
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> so great that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are <unk> that <unk> a time of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we did.
I'm more than <unk> <unk>.
It's the most <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>, we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now, how do we do it?
Of course, through a <unk> <unk> is a game.
It's a little bit more <unk> when they use <unk>.
It's more <unk> when it's <unk> cells as our <unk>: you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> a <unk> process.
In the <unk> <unk> is <unk>, because we <unk> it in the <unk>, but we're able to do a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> from a <unk>.
The two different as men from <unk>.
We <unk> <unk> some <unk> in the <unk> way that we could <unk> to do this.
The <unk> <unk>, then <unk> with <unk> <unk>.
And when we put in the <unk> was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk>, and we <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
And I'm going to get to go to go to <unk>, but we've tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the <unk> <unk>.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> <unk> a second or a third <unk> from some of a second <unk> of new <unk> <unk> to that species.
So who think about evolution as a <unk> <unk> to the time you can't be <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that was in the <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk>.
It's <unk>, and it's <unk> the other <unk> like <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and we <unk>, and the new <unk>.
It's <unk> to the <unk> because of the genes that we've <unk>.
And in a <unk> <unk> of time, all the <unk> of a species species of a species of a species, <unk>, <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> on the new <unk>, we <unk> in the <unk>.
All the <unk> are <unk>, <unk> are <unk>, and when they're <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now, this could be <unk> <unk>, but <unk> the software we can change the DNA <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that here is not <unk> -- but of <unk> -- but of <unk> million years and a half million years and a half years of evolution, and a new <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> in this <unk>.
Why do do what?
I think it's enough to our <unk>.
We're going to go from six billion and a half people to <unk> billion people to <unk> billion people in the next next years.
<unk> for a example: I'm <unk> in <unk>.
Now there are three people on the planet for <unk> <unk> in the <unk>; it's four.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, water and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> for six billion and a half half half half half billion and a half people.
We're more <unk> to do it for five.
<unk> <unk> billion billion billion billion <unk>, <unk> billion billion billion <unk>.
That means percent of <unk> <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process for <unk>, it's going to be a huge challenge.
In more to <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And in the day, because of the <unk> in the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like that the <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry only <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and think about how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> are <unk> data from the <unk>, and <unk> from our <unk>.
Now we have the <unk>, because of these <unk> <unk>, and we can create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk>.
Think of these 20 million genes or <unk> of these 20 million or <unk>, new <unk>, new <unk>, new <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, and create a little team of science, and create more <unk>.
And it's just a <unk> <unk>.
We can have to <unk> to <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
This is an <unk> of some software software <unk> that we're working for being able to be able to <unk> and <unk> species to <unk>.
Well, we don't know how they're going to be.
We know what they're like.
Now we're <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> generation.
You've seen you know you know that <unk> was a experiment.
We've got to <unk>, and the third generation that <unk> enough from <unk> <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that we're working a big <unk>, without <unk> the <unk> of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which we're working working working for <unk> cells that we're working working working for <unk> to <unk>, and we think, and we think we think we're working working with this,
The light <unk> with the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> but in our <unk>, in our <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the ocean, in <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of water.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> as <unk>.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> the <unk>, which can be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, to <unk> this process.
So, we think about a long that we can be able to <unk> what the question is the <unk> of the <unk>, "We have the <unk> <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> <unk> the entire <unk> industry.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it.
It's <unk> a <unk> of energy.
And, we're working working for <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with the <unk>, we're always going to go to a year and with a year in a year, when it's going to be <unk>.
I think what you can change can change <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
Here's how the future could be <unk>, now, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> evolution, <unk> evolution, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and the <unk>.
We're so so so from the <unk> people.
Our <unk> is to do in a way to live enough to <unk> to <unk>. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
So, I'm going to show you, the <unk> <unk>, some <unk> job, some of the new technology that we have to <unk> a year ago. It's <unk>. This is <unk>.
It's a <unk> environment that you can <unk> it's <unk> to the <unk> of data that <unk> with an <unk> <unk>.
Here we're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> with a species of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the images like we want.
And not matter how much much of information that we see, how are are these great <unk> or the images.
Most of the <unk> <unk>, but this for example is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
It's not not one difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system as this is the number of <unk> on your <unk> on the screen in any time.
This is a whole book, example of data.
This is the <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, it's just about <unk> and not <unk>, we can do something like that, to see a real <unk> of the <unk>, and it's not a real <unk> of a real picture.
It's a way to be a little bit of <unk> to read a book.
I don't show you.
This is a more <unk>. It's a number of a number of the <unk>.
Every picture is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it's really a really <unk> and the <unk> experience of a <unk> <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature of a <unk>, which is for nature.
We also did something with the <unk> of this number in this number of this number in the <unk>.
We've got a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> and we <unk> you have to <unk> <unk>.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or other <unk>, or even the <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of these ideas to <unk> space.
And I think this <unk> to <unk> and other <unk>, not <unk> to other <unk>, not <unk>.
Of course, the <unk> is one of the most <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this is not want to <unk> time, if we don't want to say that we <unk> to be in this <unk>.
These are all the <unk> in the United States on a picture of <unk>.
So now I'm going to <unk> something else.
This is actually from the <unk>, you can see it.
It's a <unk> project called <unk>, which is <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk>, one of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
And it's from the <unk>, <unk> from <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from an image of the <unk> and have this kind of experience to <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of images here has actually a <unk>.
The <unk> of the computer have <unk> these images, in the <unk>, where they're <unk> to <unk> places where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk>. And you see here, you see this <unk> or <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and they're <unk> <unk>, and they're <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I don't know if I've got to show you some other environment.
There are some more <unk>.
I want to go to a <unk> of <unk> data and this <unk> <unk>, and this <unk> <unk> <unk> that we did it for the first time to show you what it's really the first time to show you what it's really <unk>. And it's not <unk>. And it's not <unk> <unk>. And we have to <unk> it.
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>. And then on the <unk> and saying, other <unk> and saying, and <unk> <unk>.
So I'm all <unk> from <unk> and <unk> are all <unk> to <unk>.
And it's possible to <unk> this way.
You know, I would never be <unk> to work for <unk>.
It's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you see that that's a lot of a lot of different different different <unk>: from those <unk> <unk>, a <unk> number, <unk> together, <unk> together, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can <unk>, I can <unk> to <unk> those <unk>.
Many of them are <unk> from <unk>, <unk>.
And the part here is a series of <unk> -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> of this environment.
The point is that we can do about things with the social environment. This is now <unk> data from the entire <unk> of <unk> as <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> all of <unk> and <unk> all data.
All those are <unk> together, <unk> together, <unk> <unk>.
You have a <unk> model of the entire Earth that <unk>.
Think about this as a <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth.
It's something that <unk> in the <unk>, who are <unk>, and the <unk> that you <unk> <unk> with the <unk>.
They are <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people.
If somebody is the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk>, my picture, my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. And I can use these data, and I can use how to <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that, and then I can use a <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of all that are <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>. It's not just from <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, but <unk>, <unk>.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I really really really good? What do your software is that to do is that to do is that in the next years, all the <unk> of the world, all the <unk> of the world are <unk> <unk> <unk>?
<unk>: Yeah. That's doing it in fact.
It's <unk> of the <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's doing <unk> in the <unk> of images.
The thing is very interesting if you think about <unk> information information that many of these images.
As a <unk> <unk> of images on the <unk>, you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk>, a lot of information about the <unk> of the <unk>.
Now, what happens if that picture is <unk> to all your picture?
So the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> is really huge. It's a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
CA: <unk>, it's really amazing.
<unk>: I'm very much.
One of the <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, or that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and that's a sense that <unk> <unk>, and it's not just a sense of <unk>, but it's a a <unk>, but it's <unk>.
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that our <unk> has done, or very <unk>, a lot of <unk>.
And of course, all of the <unk> <unk>.
All of all. <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death, so you're not <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the <unk>, the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter that the <unk> of the <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk> or a <unk> in the heart.
He was my <unk> of my <unk> <unk> a month ago, or a month ago, or a <unk> of <unk> in the <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world.
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of <unk> to think, other ways of them to get in the world.
And, if you <unk> a moment, it's a concept that can show you.
<unk>, the <unk> of the world of the world <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> that <unk> the planet and important for the planet as <unk>.
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and <unk>, and you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>,
The <unk> is the <unk> of <unk>.
It's the <unk> of what we're and what we're in how <unk> species.
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was happened to <unk> and <unk> much more <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all the species is <unk> or the species is <unk>, because it's <unk>, or -- in the <unk> <unk>, or -- and <unk> <unk> -- and you don't <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of all that is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
One language is not just <unk> from a <unk> or a <unk> of rules.
One language is the <unk> of human.
It's the half the which the <unk> of every culture is in the world.
Every language is a <unk> of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk> thinking, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we're here to <unk>, at least least, at least the <unk> of children.
They're not more <unk> to children, which means, <unk>, less than they're <unk>.
What there's more <unk> of being <unk> from the <unk>, to be the last <unk>, of the <unk> <unk>, of the way to <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>?
This <unk> <unk> was a few few few few few weeks, in some of every two weeks: every two weeks, a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> a <unk> language.
And I know that somebody of you <unk>. "It's not better?
The world doesn't be a better place if you're all the same language? "<unk>, then we're going to <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
And I think it's <unk>, I don't talk to your language.
I'd like to do a <unk> <unk> through the <unk> --
a little <unk> in the <unk> to show you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us <unk> that when I say, "I say," I really mean different ways of <unk>.
<unk> for example, in <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that is not in the <unk> of the <unk>, because the <unk> <unk> <unk>, because it's <unk> in the <unk>, which <unk> the <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk>, "You have to <unk> a different language.
All of all that has <unk> in the past, <unk> is that these families or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven or seven <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> one language.
You know, we <unk> and then <unk> to talk.
And I'm going to be interesting with the <unk> that I was, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has the first <unk> in the <unk>.
In five <unk> <unk> have a <unk> <unk>.
They've done from the <unk> <unk> that they <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> <unk> had never seen nothing of <unk>.
They <unk> the picture from the <unk>, they <unk> to <unk> a form of a <unk>, or a <unk>, they're <unk>, they <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> <unk> with the five <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> not only the <unk>.
They <unk> <unk> in them.
<unk> percent of the <unk> <unk> was <unk> from their own.
We're <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> of death and when we've got to know, they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that's <unk> <unk>, and then they <unk> it's <unk>. And then they <unk> the same.
The <unk> were able to <unk> the animal from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species.
<unk> years years, I was <unk> a really interesting <unk> when my <unk> <unk>, I wanted to go to <unk> <unk>, if I wanted to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
And to give a sense of <unk>, I had to understand the culture and that the <unk> is not <unk>.
It's pretty pretty a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's interesting.
If you're going to <unk> to <unk> the world, what me?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
A continent is always always <unk> out, thinking that Africa is <unk>. And, "<unk> is not another. And the <unk> is not another that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes it interesting is the <unk> is the <unk> between the life and the death.
So the <unk> do <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> from <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
So, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We <unk> in <unk> and God.
And from time you're <unk>, is the <unk> that you can <unk>, like you can <unk> you know, as you can you <unk> it?
So, you're <unk> to these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's <unk> a <unk> of the power of the <unk> of the <unk>.
We all the <unk> with the <unk> that I was the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. And I <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a continent of <unk>, this <unk> never been <unk> from <unk>.
And I'm <unk> by a <unk>, but they're <unk> by a <unk>.
The young young <unk> are <unk> from <unk> or four or four years, and they live in a world world of <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> for 18 years.
Two of five years of five years of <unk> <unk>. And I'm <unk> in the <unk> of the mother, I'm <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>.
So, they're <unk> to <unk> values, they're <unk> to <unk> values, and only only their <unk> and only only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say, <unk> <unk>.
And the <unk> of this incredible <unk>, they're <unk> out and for the first time in their <unk>, in their <unk>, and the <unk>. And that's a <unk> <unk>. And that's <unk> when the first time <unk> <unk>, and then the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. And it's <unk> <unk>. The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>? I said, I said.
It's <unk>. Now it's at you <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk> and they say that we're <unk>, <unk>, we're <unk> <unk>, and they're <unk> <unk>,
This level of <unk> is extremely important.
When we think about <unk> and <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> story of the <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> <unk> or <unk> and <unk>, and we're <unk> to <unk> the Earth.
The <unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
There's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or in the <unk> <unk>, but to the <unk>, to the time and <unk>, they <unk> <unk>, they <unk> <unk> <unk>, but to <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, it's just <unk> to be <unk>.
What do it?
I mean that a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> that the <unk> is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> a human <unk> and <unk>, it's a different <unk> and <unk>, which is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that's a <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
That's the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
What is interesting the <unk> that is the <unk> between the <unk> and the world.
I'm <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for being <unk>.
And that's a human being different from my friends who believe that the <unk> are <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you're <unk> to <unk> that these <unk> can create different <unk>, to understand some of them <unk>. <unk> this <unk>. <unk> this <unk>. <unk> this <unk>.
I've <unk> this picture of <unk> in the <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk>, the most <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes it <unk> is not the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk>, but his <unk>.
And the side, this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. But it's <unk> with the <unk>, but it's <unk> with a <unk> of the family <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> has <unk> <unk>, very <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you're going to see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> that they do a different <unk> of species, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like to be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> of the <unk>. It's <unk> <unk>. It's actually a <unk> of the <unk>.
They were often with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> <unk> <unk>, with his <unk> <unk>.
My <unk> <unk> don't <unk> <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you're not going to tell nobody of being <unk>. <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>, but they can't be <unk> because they can't be <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
It's possible <unk> <unk> if you're <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk> <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> <unk>, the same <unk> of the same kind of <unk>, the same thing for <unk>. The <unk> <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, but they're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>,
We use the big <unk> of the <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if you're <unk> to <unk>, we're <unk> <unk>. "
What do it?
This <unk>, the <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, and that we <unk> in our eyes in the same species.
If you know how they <unk> their <unk> <unk> us, "<unk> <unk> of plants, of the plants, of the rest of plants, I said," No. "
The solution is: you <unk> <unk> <unk> in a night, and <unk> <unk> <unk> with a different <unk>.
And so, you're not <unk> to <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk>.
Now, <unk> the <unk> is that also the problem is that also the heart <unk> <unk> them, but in some way to <unk> the <unk> of our world of our world, and <unk>.
In fact, the <unk> century, in the <unk> century, not <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk>, but as the <unk> was in which we <unk> and we <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>. Now, and <unk> <unk>. Now, and the <unk> is the <unk>. Now,
All the <unk> through the <unk> are <unk> in a <unk> for new <unk> to new <unk>.
And the problem is not the technology.
The <unk> <unk> don't <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> to be <unk> and <unk> as <unk> <unk>, they <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> <unk>. It's the power of <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And if you look at the world, <unk> that these are not <unk> <unk>.
They're <unk> and <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> that are <unk> in their ability to <unk>.
<unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has been <unk> in the <unk> to a generation, and now <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, where the <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
We <unk> to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk>.
Or in the case of the <unk>, they are <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk>.
If I'm going to <unk> on the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of <unk>, you'll see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
As <unk> the <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, is <unk> to <unk>, but the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> of a <unk>, the <unk> of a <unk>, not only <unk>, but <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, but <unk> <unk> in some <unk> of the <unk>.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and you can't understand the beginning.
I've got the <unk> miles in the <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, but only we just just <unk> to <unk>. And I've been <unk> what's the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
The father was <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that was <unk> to say that was <unk> to the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that has <unk> to <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk>.
It was <unk> to <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> in the age of two years of two <unk> <unk> because it was not to live without <unk>.
The <unk>, who did the same, it was <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
A day has <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> and, for this <unk>, was <unk> to work for seven years.
The <unk> of <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> of the <unk> is from <unk>.
And then, all of the <unk>, all of a choice.
Do we live in the world of the <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> world?
The big <unk> <unk>, before he said that his most <unk> <unk>, in our <unk> <unk>, in our <unk> <unk>, in our <unk> world, not only <unk> the world, not only <unk> the world, but a day, a day, a day, but we have a day day, we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's <unk> that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, which has to <unk>, which has done <unk> to the <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, and we talk about <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world has to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
That <unk> story I didn't <unk> that we have to <unk> all the challenge that we <unk> to go.
When these <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> is asked what to say to be human, <unk>, <unk> with <unk> <unk>.
And it's in these <unk> that all <unk> to be what we all are: a <unk> species, which is a <unk>, which is to <unk> and all the <unk> <unk>. And they're <unk>. And there are great <unk>.
I've <unk> this picture of the <unk> <unk>, when I went to <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and this man, and this man, and this man, I <unk>, I <unk> the <unk>, and this man.
The government <unk> is not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the years for <unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>, we have <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> all the <unk>, and all the <unk>, and all of his <unk>.
We know what the <unk> is not <unk> the <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> were <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> from night or <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk>, <unk>, it's <unk> <unk> and <unk> in their hand. When I did it, I <unk> up, the <unk> has <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> on <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> has <unk> a <unk>, has <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> talk about <unk>? <unk> <unk>. And this, in different ways, in different ways, <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> the government <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk>. <unk> all the <unk>.
One example of how a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with his <unk>.
And, to go, I think it's pretty <unk> at least who's been in these <unk> of the planet, <unk> that are not all <unk>.
For somebody is home.
<unk> <unk> <unk> of human <unk> that <unk> to the <unk> of human <unk>. And for all of these children, like our children, they're part of our children, they're part of the <unk> of <unk>.
And we <unk>, we're <unk> <unk> that <unk> are <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> are not <unk>, but we think that the stories can change the world, and maybe we're the best <unk> to tell the world of the world. Every month. Every <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
We're <unk> from <unk> million people.
Our work is <unk> in the <unk> for our audience in places of <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from what they've seen and, and <unk>, <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and we have to find a world, and we have to find a world, and we have to find a world and find a <unk> world.
where the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> can <unk> to our <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I've been doing other things that I'm going to <unk> and <unk> to <unk> some <unk>, in the case, in the case, in the case, in the case I'm going to be <unk>.
I want to know what I call "<unk> <unk>."
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all the society <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our <unk> <unk> <unk>." The way to do it is <unk>. "
The reason is, from a side, in fact that the <unk> is in the same <unk>. It's <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to <unk> human beings.
And another other other is that if we're <unk>, each of us can <unk> to do that that <unk> our <unk>, without no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no one.
The way to <unk> the <unk> is <unk>.
<unk> people have, more people have <unk>, and more <unk>, and more, the <unk> is their <unk>.
This, <unk>, it's so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> in our lives.
And I'm going to show you some examples of what the <unk> has to be.
This is my <unk>. It's not really great.
I'm going to be a simple <unk> on <unk>.
In my <unk> <unk> there are <unk> <unk>, without <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
Here's what's what's <unk>.
And then you go to the <unk> <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> of <unk>, there's a big number of <unk>.
We can make six million <unk> and a half different <unk> using the <unk> that are in a <unk>.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: The world of the <unk>.
One time, I was a child, you could get all the <unk> <unk>, and they were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> the <unk>, you don't <unk>.
One of what, between the other, it was that the <unk> <unk>.
These times they went.
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk>, especially between the <unk>.
Here's the <unk> of the future.
My <unk> is what in a half, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> for the <unk> <unk>.
If you're not <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk>, you're <unk> in the home, you're <unk>.
And what is to the end is that people <unk> in <unk> and it's the answer? The answer? The answer is the answer? The answer is. "
It's not possible to buy a phone that doesn't <unk> things.
So, in other other people who are much more than the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the same <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: It's not more in the United States that you're going to <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you.
Instead, <unk> from <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we could do it, or" <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk> <unk>, and these <unk> and these <unk>. What do you want to do? "
You know, "<unk>, what do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk>, and these <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> it."
"What you want to do?"
And you say, "<unk> if she was, what do?"
And the <unk>, "But I don't she's."
The result of the <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> thing.
But actually it's not that one <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> to make it out of their own own own own <unk>, <unk>, to <unk>, and they don't know -- and they don't know, and so it's <unk> to <unk>.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk>, <unk> to people like me and you, and you, you think about it's not <unk>.
But if we don't <unk>, why do we're <unk>?
The answer is that they want to <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
And so so much as a <unk> is our <unk>. It's a <unk> question of choice, like this <unk>, "We don't <unk> their <unk>." We don't <unk> to <unk> them. "We have to <unk>." We have to <unk>.
And we can <unk> them.
The means that every <unk>, to <unk>, you know, you know, you want to be.
<unk> <unk> to the family and <unk>, a time the <unk> <unk>, almost almost for anyone, and they <unk> to all the most <unk>, and you get to kids.
The only <unk> <unk> was with who, when, I don't know what after.
<unk>, all it's really to play.
And they're <unk> to <unk>, and they <unk> their 20 percent in the work less than work.
And because they're not less <unk>, because they are less <unk>.
but why I'm <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> or not? "
"<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>? I have to think before I before I want to be <unk>?"
I'm <unk> <unk>.
And they try to be to <unk> these questions, even if this <unk> <unk> <unk> that and not to get a <unk> <unk>.
And they really have to do it. I'm important questions.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, because the technology <unk>, every day, every day, every day, every day, <unk> that's <unk> from <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I don't tell you nobody, where the <unk> works.
I don't tell you, because I want to use it.
What means, this incredible <unk> of <unk>? It's what is about about work?
We can see to see our <unk>, with the <unk>, with the <unk>, the <unk>, the other, and the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, on the <unk>.
And even if they're <unk>, every minute that we see our <unk> <unk>, we're <unk>, "I have to be <unk>,"
"" I have to be <unk>? I have this <unk>? "
And when the answer is, "No, it's not, all this is the experience of your <unk> of your <unk> of your <unk>.
So, from any other other look, and small things, and <unk>, and <unk> of life, life is a question of <unk>.
One time the world was this: <unk>, there were some of the <unk>, but it was a <unk> of choice.
The world of today today today, <unk> is, "It's a <unk> thing, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> them, so I'm going to talk about those <unk>.
And this <unk> <unk> two two two two two <unk>.
The first, <unk>, it's that <unk> <unk>.
With many <unk> in which, it's very hard to do it.
And I'll show you a <unk> example: one <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> my <unk> has <unk> to data, <unk> <unk>, with a million <unk> <unk>, with a million <unk>.
What she was that for every 10 <unk>, which is that <unk> are <unk> in the most of <unk> <unk>.
With 50 <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent in less than <unk> when they are only five. Why do they are only five. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> in the <unk> that, is <unk> to <unk>, and <unk> is <unk> to <unk>.
And at <unk>, and again, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, and of course, you can't be.
And it's not just that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food for <unk> <unk>, because they don't want to say that the reason is so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They're not <unk>, they're <unk> to five <unk> <unk> for a year of work, which would be <unk>.
So the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> to <unk>.
And I think that <unk> the world so.
"And for the <unk>, for the <unk>: <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
You know, I just want to do the right right, if it's the right <unk>, right?
You don't want to be the <unk>, and <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
So this is the first <unk>. The second is that if we can <unk> to <unk> the <unk> and do a <unk>, to the end of how they're <unk> from the <unk> of how they're <unk>.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with many <unk> <unk> in which, if you're going to <unk> a <unk>, is easy, it's easy to <unk> that would be better. And that's better. And what's what happens is that's what happens is that's what's what happens is what happens is that's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk>.
And when it was a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there are more than <unk> <unk>.
And, there's what <unk> <unk>.
It's a lot of well as the <unk> <unk>, we <unk> things that with things that <unk>.
And then, when there are many <unk> <unk>, is easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> to be <unk> and <unk>.
Here's a example. I'm going to be <unk> with all of New York.
But it's what you're <unk>.
There's this <unk> to <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk>. <unk>. <unk>. It's all for them.
I don't know anything. But that he's, "Well, <unk>, <unk>, is <unk>."
"All my <unk>." They are on. "
"<unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of home."
And two weeks from two weeks from the idea that's <unk> -- every day -- every day -- every day -- the <unk> of <unk> where you want.
The <unk> <unk> for that we have, even when the <unk> is <unk>.
And the most <unk> that we have from <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> says there is a lot of things.
It's about the time, and maybe in the time, and maybe it's <unk>.
But the most important is that any thing you're going to be <unk>, you're <unk> to do.
The things that they don't have many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
I've tried on my <unk> a new <unk>.
It's almost <unk>.
One time the <unk> were a kind of <unk>, they were <unk> and <unk> from <unk>, just after <unk> <unk> a lot of life and <unk> a lot of times, <unk>, <unk> to go.
So, I <unk> to <unk> a new when they were <unk>, and I said, "I said," I said, "I'm my <unk>."
The <unk> <unk> said, "You want to <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
You want to <unk> or <unk>? "
"Do you want to you?"
"<unk> <unk> them or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk>? <unk> <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little bit of <unk>, I want to say, "I want the only kind of <unk>." It was the only kind of <unk>. And I was so for a <unk> <unk>. And then, then I've got to <unk>, and then, with the best <unk>, and I've ever <unk>.
It was the <unk>. <unk> all that <unk> the best.
But I'm going to be <unk>.
Why? I said a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was <unk> with all that is with all the choice of my <unk> were <unk>.
And I was <unk>. I didn't get nothing when I'm not going to get a kind of <unk>, as a few different <unk>, at least one kind of of being a <unk>.
And I was <unk> good, but not a good.
After <unk> what I was <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in life in the people don't <unk> that these are <unk> <unk> that these are <unk>.
And this <unk> less <unk>, even when the <unk> are good.
<unk> in the world if you're going to get.
Because if you know, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth <unk> <unk>.
"It was better when he was <unk>," The reason that was better when it was better when it was <unk>, when he was <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world we live -- <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to the <unk>.
You've never never <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, my <unk>, and my <unk>, and they're <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>," Yes, you want. "
I mean -- I mean -- I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I don't have to do better, I'm not <unk>.
But I don't always always always, it's a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk> of your <unk> <unk> when there's just that kind of <unk>, when you're not <unk>, and you're not <unk>, and you're not <unk>, and you're not <unk>, and you say? "
"Who is <unk>?" "" ""
The world is the <unk>. What I could you do it?
When there are hundreds of kinds of <unk>, and <unk> a <unk>, and you <unk> a <unk>, is <unk>, <unk>, is <unk> that the <unk>, is <unk> that the <unk> is <unk> you.
I could be better.
With hundreds of <unk> <unk>, there are <unk> for <unk>.
So when people are <unk>, even if the result is <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> and <unk> to them them.
In the last years, the <unk> is <unk> in the world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but -- I'm going to be that people have to be <unk> because the <unk> are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this, they think that <unk> is them.
So the end of the <unk> is that we're better, <unk>, but we're going to be <unk>.
I'm going to be <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we're going to do for good and it's completely <unk>. It's not true.
There's no <unk> <unk> that a little bit of choice is better better than it's not better than a little bit of a little bit.
There's a <unk> <unk>, <unk>. I don't know what it's.
But I'm sure we <unk> from a piece of a piece of the <unk> that the <unk> <unk> our life.
Now, from the <unk> <unk> -- I've been <unk> -- from the point of <unk>, the <unk> is the <unk>.
What you get this choice to the <unk> is the <unk> <unk>.
There are many places in the world, and you're <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not that they have <unk>.
The problem is that they're too <unk>.
And so I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> society.
And that's <unk> and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. And it's <unk> about how those <unk> <unk> and <unk> to <unk> are <unk>.
I mean that these <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, it's not that are just <unk>.
I'm <unk> <unk>.
They do it.
If a little bit of what in our society is <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is what the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
One of the <unk> <unk> <unk>. And everybody -- not only to the <unk> of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us.
And I said, "<unk>, you can be all that you want to be --
<unk>, people, <unk>, <unk>: "But what is going to do," What would you be that fish? "
"It's <unk> that you can't make nothing in a <unk> of the <unk>."
"One of the <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk>."
And I <unk> I <unk> so, I <unk> so, at the beginning.
But then, I, I'm going to me that that fish is the long thing.
Because the fact of the fact that if you're <unk> in <unk>, in the <unk>, and that's possible. "You can't <unk> the <unk>. It's <unk>. It's <unk>.
If you <unk> the way that everything <unk> <unk> as <unk>.
<unk> the <unk>, and <unk> the <unk>.
They need a <unk>.
This is almost too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and <unk> for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and, <unk>, for <unk>, for the <unk>.
Thank you.
