<unk> year, I showed these <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years had the size of the United States had <unk> dimensions of the United States <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn't show the ice <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is, in a certain sense, the heart of the climate system.
It <unk> <unk> and <unk> in summer.
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
You see, they <unk> up to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which is <unk> summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years or more, is like the blood, which here <unk> from the body.
In 25 years it was spent 25 years old.
This is a problem because the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean where there are enormous <unk> of <unk> that, <unk>, <unk>, are being <unk> in <unk> by the <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, <unk> this point of not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> from the water.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> has <unk> with a <unk> team <unk> a <unk> <unk> last <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: <unk>! <unk>: She's OK. The question is if you <unk> it.
And that's a reason that this <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north.
This is a river in <unk>.
<unk> had never <unk> levels.
This is the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> of <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the sea level of <unk>, here is where the sea.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
On the other part of the planet: <unk>, the largest <unk> of ice on the planet.
<unk> month, <unk> scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk>, and that the <unk> <unk>, which <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk> at <unk> feet of the <unk>, as in <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which a few years ago, they were <unk>.
40 percent of the world's population will <unk> half of the water <unk> from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this <unk> is the source of water <unk> of this city.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, the same happens to the water.
<unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> is 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, as you read, they're <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in the world is <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> outside the normal and without <unk>.
<unk> times over the last 30 years, <unk> <unk> to the <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk>.
If you look in the context of the <unk> can see the <unk>.
In the last five years we've been <unk> 70 million <unk> -- 25 million <unk> -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day.
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk>, from <unk>, to <unk>, and on both parts of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean.
The <unk> of global <unk>, together to the <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk>, together to China.
And they're trying to build a lot of other <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> of direction.
These are the projects <unk> in the last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And so there is a political <unk> in our country.
The <unk> of <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
<unk> picture me something --
<unk> <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
You may have seen it on the <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk> in America.
It's going around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and it makes our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> is a lot of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
The largest <unk> society is <unk> <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So the <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> has <unk> two <unk>.
This is one of them, one part.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> we see the changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
That's why our <unk> is <unk> a lot of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth.
<unk> is, actually not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it's also a good <unk>.
So we don't know about climate change.
We want to do it.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of it.
So we <unk> a turn into a structure to the <unk> as much as <unk>.
<unk>! <unk> are a little <unk>, but that's the sound of the <unk> technology.
<unk> <unk> is between the major global <unk> of global warming, but the <unk> technology that you see changes everything.
Let's look at this: the <unk> <unk> technology.
<unk>: <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and national security.
<unk>: <unk> is in the crisis; America is a national security, the <unk> crisis.
The <unk> that <unk> all of them: our <unk> <unk> <unk>, like <unk> and the <unk> oil.
Now, there's a new thing, <unk> <unk> solution.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy in 10 years.
A <unk> plan for <unk> America to work, <unk> more <unk>, and help <unk> global warming.
<unk>, a solution that is <unk> to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more.
<unk>: This is the last one.
<unk>: <unk>: That's about <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> to the <unk> that <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, sun, a new network.
<unk> <unk> 2: <unk> <unk> for jobs well.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: A old <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go, you go alone.
If you want to go far, you go together. "
We have to go far, fast.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on <unk>.
And I'm going to try to <unk> how the machine works.
So, I'm there. And for those who didn't have, the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk>.
<unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were in the <unk> of a second from the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second.
All of that is just <unk>.
This is the <unk> machine.
We <unk> these <unk> <unk> into the <unk>.
This is what I'm working on. It's called <unk> -- it's <unk> <unk> feet.
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in <unk> in the construction, so you can see the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> of last year we <unk> the machine for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the control.
It's a picture of the first <unk> of particles that he had done everything around the <unk>, <unk> in <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles inside the <unk>.
In other words, when you <unk> that <unk> the <unk> <unk>, I <unk> that the machine <unk>, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to <unk> us more or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page <unk> was this.
That means that we've had a <unk> impact over to the scientific.
<unk> a week later, there was a problem with the machine, had to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of the <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you are <unk> the <unk> and <unk>, "it's not true. I'm too <unk> too <unk>."
And they can do that because when they're very <unk> become the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, <unk> degrees <unk>, at a <unk> temperature <unk> to the space between stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, there was a <unk> of <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> over 20 <unk>, and they've <unk> about 30 <unk>.
They <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
They're now <unk> to their <unk> place.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be again.
We <unk> it, and we decided to get some data to <unk> or <unk>, and continue so our <unk> to find out what the universe is.
Now, of course, in a way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering of <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think the fact that's so hard, the fact of going beyond the <unk>, I think it's the value of things like <unk>.
I'd like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, who, <unk> <unk> of the <unk> experiments of his <unk>, his <unk> was Michael <unk>, said, "No, <unk> so <unk> about the ideas of science are <unk>, that there are not <unk> in nature, that there are no <unk> in nature, that there are <unk> <unk>, and that there are no new <unk>."
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> <unk> to when, as children, <unk> <unk>.
As I was <unk> as <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, actually to think and <unk> problems.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> to the way that most of the world around us.
So, as a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> <unk> with objects, together to my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I started <unk>, I started <unk>, and I started <unk>, "And if we use a computer, instead of having the <unk> <unk> <unk> as a digital <unk> that moves on a <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk>,
and <unk> to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that I thought about <unk>, building the <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> <unk> as a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> <unk> as a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with your hand, "<unk>" <unk> "between them," <unk> "between them," and they have a radio <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, like <unk>, you can just <unk>.
<unk> are the example of a new tools to <unk> the digital information to <unk> digital information.
And as they become <unk>, <unk> of their movement, other people, and they're <unk>, and as they get <unk>, of their own movement, other, of how we <unk> them, <unk> <unk>.
We're going to start with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show about video: if you put it in a direction, the video so, it's going to be able to see it in a direction, it's going to be <unk> back.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk>.
If you <unk> them, you're <unk> what's going around them.
If they're <unk>, they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
If they're <unk>, they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We have then realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> <unk> was that we could use common <unk> on data, for example, "<unk>" a color like a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> the color in the central, where they <unk>.
and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color in central <unk>, where they <unk>.
If we're too too much, we can <unk> it a little bit.
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk>, like <unk>, <unk> and <unk> where people can <unk> things, and <unk> where people can <unk> things, and <unk> the results immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a <unk> game <unk>.
<unk>, at every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, and as I was <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Then, about 30 seconds, you get <unk>, and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Here we go to the <unk> <unk> <unk>, I did the <unk> <unk>, and I <unk> a video.
They're very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things about this <unk> is that you don't have to give people many <unk>.
They just say, "<unk> of words," and they know exactly what to do.
Here we go.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, right there.
It actually wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
We wanted to build a tool for the <unk> of the <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
Here, it's <unk> out the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now he's brought a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work! Yeah!
So, <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk> <unk>, and it can decide how they <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk> <unk>, and it can decide how they <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> away, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, made of <unk>, to <unk> and <unk> music.
is a <unk>, made of recently <unk>, to <unk> and music.
The <unk> here are <unk> by <unk> as basic, low and <unk>.
<unk> of these have four different <unk>, and you can choose which we use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> sequence.
And we just <unk> a <unk> <unk> a sound and a sequence. "
These are the effects that you can control of alive, like <unk> and <unk>.
It <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk>.
And then there are the <unk> effects of as time and <unk>, who are <unk> to the entire sequence.
<unk> like it works.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "."
Now I'm going to take a <unk> line.
<unk>: <unk>: Now I'm going to <unk> <unk> --
<unk>: <unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk>, so I can control the effect of alive.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> the entire sequence <unk> <unk> the time on one hand or on the other.
<unk>: <unk>: And now we're going to <unk> the bottom for <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> the <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>."
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk> it, I can <unk> it, <unk> more <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the whole sequence of the left <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work.
And today, I've had time to show you one of this <unk>, and also some possibilities that we're trying to bring out of the lab.
And the concept that I want to <unk> is that it's going to take this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with the media media, which we want to do this information in our world in the way we want to.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time I'm going to talk to all of you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more than that, of course.
It's also the love and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't look like it can change.
But, I said, something particular happened in my life and my career, who brought me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that it <unk> now, people <unk> me as if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to go back to me and say, "You're not afraid to be able to do better than?
You're not afraid to write all of life without having to be able to create a book that could <unk> to someone? "
What can it do? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could be worse, except for me that over 20 years ago, when I was talking to people -- I was a <unk> -- that I wanted to be a <unk>.
I'm going to come back to the same <unk> <unk> by fear.
And people say, "<unk>'t you want to be able to be successful?
You're not afraid that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>?
You're not afraid to make this <unk> for all life without <unk> that nothing out and dying on a <unk> of <unk> <unk>? "
So, you know.
The <unk> answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid of all those things.
I've always had fear.
And I also fear of many other things that people couldn't <unk>.
As <unk> and other things <unk>.
But, as far as I was writing what I thought and <unk> <unk> is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel used to be <unk> for doing.
But what's so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don't do?
How about my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember one time in his <unk> years of <unk> activity where asked if they were afraid to be <unk>?
There was ever ever -- that <unk> of <unk> John, how does it go?
<unk>'t it like that, <unk>?
<unk>, engineers as <unk> have no <unk>, in <unk>, in <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not only <unk> but <unk> of all of these kinds, we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
And they're not going to go to the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, <unk> young people and often for their hand.
And even the ones that they're not <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before they died, in the last <unk> said, "My book <unk> me a little bit more." A <unk> <unk> about the work of their life.
But we don't want to know when we're talking about this because we've heard these things so long that somehow we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some ways that <unk> and the art, at the end, <unk> always <unk>.
And the question I want to ask all of this here is: are you agree with this idea?
It's OK, you're going to be very <unk> by a <unk> distance to me.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk>, and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better to <unk> our big <unk> <unk> to live.
And of course, I know that, in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> towards that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> that I'm in my career.
<unk> -- <unk> look at this, I'm pretty young, I've got 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything will happen in now, it's going to be <unk> by the world like the work that after the <unk> success of my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all about <unk> friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>!
You know, this is the kind of thought that brings a person to start <unk> at nine to the nine morning and I don't want to do it.
I want to keep doing this work that I love.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so I think, after many <unk>, that the way to work to keep writing is to create a <unk> <unk>, right?
I have to have to come up with a distance of security, which I'm <unk>, and my natural <unk> to what <unk> wrote about getting <unk>. And while I was going on on the last year models of how to do it <unk> to look through time, looking for other societies to see if you could have the best ideas and <unk>.
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
It's because it <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that creativity <unk> from men, OK?
It turns out that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men in some <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> reasons <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of <unk> creativity of <unk>.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, we decided to have a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> were the same idea, but they <unk> the <unk> of the spirit without a <unk>.
That's <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really understand that a <unk> was somebody particularly.
And I thought that a <unk> was this sort of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally in the <unk> of a <unk> artist, a little bit like the <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> out to <unk> the artist's work, and <unk> the <unk> of that work.
<unk> <unk>, here is the distance I'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> that you're <unk> from the results of your work.
And everybody thought that was so that I was <unk>, right?
So, <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like the too <unk>, right?
If your work was <unk>, you wouldn't have to <unk> all the <unk>, everybody <unk> that was <unk> by this <unk> <unk>.
If your <unk> work, it wasn't all your <unk>, right?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything <unk>, and we're going to <unk> this big idea; we put the human center over the universe, all the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and not leave space to the <unk>.
This was the <unk> principle and people who are starting to think that creativity was <unk> from <unk>.
And for the first time in history, <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> to a rather than a person with the <unk>.
And I have to say, I think it was a big <unk>.
I think that somebody, a simple person to believe that they're like a <unk> like a source, the <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, a <unk>, <unk> and <unk>,
It's like you ask someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years.
And, if that is true, and I think it's the question, the question is, and now?
Can we <unk> it?
We want to go back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking about <unk> <unk> in a <unk> talk in a 18 minutes.
And there are probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, you know that <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects.
You probably don't <unk> about this thing.
But the question I'd like to ask you about is -- why not?
Why don't we <unk> this way?
Because it's more sense of anything that I've ever heard to explain the <unk> of the <unk> process.
A process that, as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so, so, basically, everybody here -- knows, you don't have <unk> <unk>.
And in fact, it can sometimes look completely <unk>.
I did this meeting <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years, but that was a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> <unk>, he was <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>.
He said, it was like a <unk> <unk> of air.
And that <unk> <unk> towards her from the <unk>.
I was going to <unk> it, because he was <unk> the earth.
We had one thing to do to do to that point and was of his words, "<unk> as a <unk>."
And so he went back to the house and he was <unk> by this <unk>, and it wouldn't have to take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough quickly as the <unk>, <unk> and <unk> on the page.
<unk> times not <unk> to be <unk>, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to come to the house and the <unk> <unk> through the <unk>, and she would <unk> the <unk> through the <unk>, looking, looking, like, "she said," another <unk>. "
And then there were those times -- this <unk>, never <unk> it -- there were moments that it was almost <unk>, right?
So, he was coming back home and was looking for paper and <unk> the <unk> through, and he had a <unk> right in the while he was <unk>, and he said, he was like he was <unk>, and he was looking at the other hand and <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would have been <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> but <unk>, the last word to the first word to the first word to the first.
So when I <unk> it -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not a <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my <unk> way is <unk>; I'm going to <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and <unk> on top of it.
But even me, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I'm also <unk> a lot of you that <unk> the <unk>.
You know, even if the work and ideas I'm going to be <unk> by a <unk> I couldn't <unk> <unk>.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it so that it doesn't <unk> your head, but rather, that <unk> us <unk>?
As I'm about, the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I've been <unk> different years ago for a <unk>.
I was talking about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk>, looking for control, <unk>, <unk> these species of <unk> totally <unk>.
But then <unk>, he was <unk>, and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk>, he was <unk> all for him.
<unk> <unk>, and everything of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk>, who comes into his head as a <unk> does the <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and wants, you know, it's wonderful, and the <unk>, but he doesn't know how to <unk>.
It's not a paper, it's not a <unk>, it's not a <unk>.
So it starts to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> <unk> in him, "I'm going to lose, and I'm going to <unk> from this <unk> song.
I'm not enough <unk>, and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of going to <unk>, they <unk>.
<unk> the whole <unk> process and made something completely new.
He just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>, you see I'm <unk>?"
"It seems to you that it looks like a song now?"
If you really want to <unk>, you'll be more <unk> when I can take care of you.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> else today.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And the process of his <unk> process after that.
Not the work, was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that outside him, <unk> that he <unk> <unk> that there was <unk> that it didn't have to be a <unk> thing and <unk>.
but it was <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that <unk> and <unk> thing that it was not <unk>.
So, how I <unk> that story is going to change a little bit of the way I <unk> and already <unk>.
This idea, I was <unk> when I was <unk> "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and I was <unk> in one of the <unk> that I was <unk> when we're all working on something and you can start thinking it's going to be a <unk>, that's going to be the <unk>, that's going to be the <unk>, who will ever do.
Not just <unk>, just <unk> book.
And I started thinking about this project.
But then I <unk> to <unk> that I <unk> to the air and <unk>.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of the room.
And I said high <unk>, "<unk>, what, we know, we know that if this book is not going to be <unk>, not going to be <unk>, right?
Because as you see, I'm <unk> everything I have, I don't have any more of that.
So if you want it better, you have to <unk> and do your part.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what, I'm going to <unk> anything.
I started writing the same because it's my job.
And I would like to say that I'm <unk> to do today, I was <unk> to do my part "because -- at the end is like that, OK -- <unk>, so that's in the end of the moon, <unk> and <unk>, music that <unk> hours to the <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every once a while, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know what I'm talking about, because I know you have seen it, you know, a <unk> like this.
It was as if time <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it wasn't different than the <unk> <unk>, like the <unk> <unk> before, but it <unk>.
And suddenly we don't just <unk> as a human.
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the fire of the <unk>.
And when this <unk>, at the time, people <unk> what was, he <unk> him.
<unk> hands and <unk> <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "God," God, "God."
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, you see this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> from "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>," which you can still hear in <unk> or <unk>.
In <unk>, when an artist did something from impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's <unk> because we need it.
But the problem comes the next day, for the <unk> same, when they <unk> and <unk> who are 11 <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of God <unk> is no more.
It's just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and maybe never <unk> to <unk> that <unk>.
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still <unk>, and what he's so he must do with, and what does it have to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you can't believe, <unk>, that the most <unk> of your being come from you.
But you're just <unk> that data from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to <unk> from this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> somebody else when you're finished.
And, you know, if we think about this way everything changes.
And so I started to <unk>, and it's certainly how I've <unk> it for several months during the book <unk> that I was soon going to be <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> of my success.
And what I need to keep <unk> when I feel like this is, I'm not afraid.
You don't <unk>. You just <unk> your job.
<unk> to <unk> for your side, any of any <unk> can be.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, you'll be <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for one moment through your <unk>, then through your <unk>, "<unk>!"
<unk>, you do the same your <unk>.
And "<unk>!" <unk>! "You're <unk>.
I think it's <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>"
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
You know, as you know, I've been talking about some of these projects about the human genome, what it can <unk> and <unk> of new genes.
Now we're going to <unk> a new path: we started <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code, we're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and life.
We always tried to <unk> big questions.
"What is life?" is something that many <unk>, I think have <unk> to understand at different levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> terms.
We're <unk> for about 20 years.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology to the digital computer in the digital world.
Now we're going to ask, how can we <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> one even smaller.
We can <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> of about 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 that are here.
But when we look at his <unk> map, it's simple than our own.
<unk>, that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at a time, it's very <unk> that can bring a <unk> cell.
So we thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of the "We can <unk> a <unk>?"
Can the chemistry <unk> of making these big molecules that we've never been able to create before?
And, in case we can make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material.
The speed with which we're able to <unk> life is <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
Our ability to write the code, instead, <unk> slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> results that <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
We've <unk> over 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before they <unk> the first experiments.
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA, of the <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and it's a <unk> process. The <unk> is a long <unk>, the <unk> is long.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, starting from information digital information of the genome of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a little virus that <unk> bacteria.
We designed the <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> about <unk> <unk>.
And the interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material <unk> and we <unk> it in the bacteria, the <unk> have <unk> to read this code and <unk> the <unk> particles.
<unk> particles have been <unk> by cells, are <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I've been talking recently with <unk> members of the <unk> industry that they've certainly <unk> this model.
They have <unk> more than you.
We think that this is a situation where the software can actually build the same <unk> into a <unk> system.
But we could do the biggest things in a big.
We had to build the whole <unk> of the <unk>.
They are more than <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> code.
So we thought about the <unk> of the <unk> of the virus, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell.
<unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> information with information <unk> into a computer, they have to be very <unk>.
When we first got this genome for the first time in <unk> the standard <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We've found, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If we were used that original sequence never <unk> that original <unk> <unk> that original <unk> will never be able to do it work.
One part of the process is design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> that <unk> together.
And I had to <unk> elements here.
You've probably read that <unk> us from the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: We have a <unk> <unk> code: A, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> together about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order for every <unk>.
So we can use the code for writing words, <unk>, <unk>.
What we've done at the beginning was <unk>.
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started to <unk> <unk> parts, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
At every step, we have produced these <unk> in <unk> so that we're trying to create a very <unk> <unk> because you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this looks like the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
When I started these very <unk> <unk>, over 100 <unk> <unk>, they don't get any longer <unk> directly in the <unk> <unk>.
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> biology.
So we've <unk> some other <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA that <unk> the <unk>.
Here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk>.
<unk> 12 hours -- <unk> hours, <unk> is <unk> exactly as it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can <unk> completely.
We could live under <unk>.
I'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and you're <unk> to find new <unk> of water <unk>.
Actually, NASA showed that this happens.
This is a picture of the <unk> that we've built using these <unk>, just using the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's such a <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are taken taken <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we've done a little time ago.
They are more than <unk> <unk> of <unk> code.
It's the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by man.
It's got a <unk> weight at 300 million.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10, you'll have to <unk> pages to <unk> this code.
Now, how do we make it work? How can we <unk>?
<unk>, of course, is a kids game.
It's a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria.
It's easier when it comes to the <unk> cells like our: you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is almost the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> is <unk> inside the cell, but we have <unk> <unk> that we are able to make a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> from a <unk> to another cell and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a species.
<unk> are different as men from the <unk>.
We <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a way that you can decide which you can decide what to do for this <unk>.
He <unk> it with <unk> so that they <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell.
And we had to <unk> that we can't go beyond, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution.
We've found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who thinks about evolution as a <unk> <unk> at the time that <unk> has no <unk> part of biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that was in the cell, we didn't have one.
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> as a <unk> material, has <unk> it, and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk>.
It's become blue because of the genes we've <unk>.
And in a short time <unk>, all of a <unk> species are <unk>, and it <unk> of the whole new software that we <unk> into the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, the <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the <unk> code exactly what we've <unk>.
Now, this may seem <unk> <unk>, but we <unk> the software, we can change things quite <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that we're not talking about <unk> -- but of progress starting three and a half million years of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> that we're <unk> to <unk> new species on this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's quite <unk> when we think about our <unk>.
We're going to spend six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example: I was born in <unk>.
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk>; in 40 years, there are four.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, water and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> for six billion and a half billion people.
We're even more <unk> to do it for nine billion.
<unk> over five billion <unk>, over 30 billion <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it's going to be a huge challenge.
We have to realize that all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere.
At the day, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are <unk> <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry is just about a <unk> of <unk>, and think about how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from the reality of the <unk> and our imagination.
We have <unk>, now we have <unk>, <unk> to these <unk> <unk> <unk>, able to create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We can build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think of these 20 million different <unk> or <unk> to try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, can change, with a small team and to create <unk> biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard <unk>.
We can choose to <unk> <unk>, <unk> chemistry or <unk>, production of <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some software that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how they will they be.
We know exactly how their code is.
We're going to <unk> on the <unk> generation.
You've seen from the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We have <unk> <unk> <unk> as soon as we <unk> as soon as it <unk> as <unk> as the <unk> or <unk> kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter before, so we're working on to design cells that can achieve that purpose, and we think we can get the first <unk> generation in about 18 months.
<unk> light <unk> CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> of <unk> around the world, we've found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we've <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the ocean, about <unk> meters of water at about <unk> feet deep at the temperature of water.
<unk> <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as much energy.
We're trying to understand whether we can <unk> CO2, which can easily be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So, a short, we think that we might be able to <unk> what the basic question, "which is" <unk>. We, we <unk> the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole <unk> industry.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where do you?
We're going to have a <unk> of energy.
<unk>, we're working for the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we're always back a year and with a dollar in less when it's about finding the <unk> right.
I think what you can change is building <unk> in <unk>.
Here's how the future could start to look <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the tree with bacteria, <unk>, <unk> cells.
We are so much better than people.
Our purpose is to make it <unk> to make it <unk>. Thank you very much.
So, I'm going to show you, the <unk> as quickly as possible, some fundamental work of the new technology that we brought to the <unk> <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago. This is <unk>.
It's a environment where you can <unk> both on the local level that you can <unk> a huge amount of data.
Here we are seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> photos with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a fast <unk>, <unk> the images as we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big these data <unk> are, or data <unk>.
Most of them are <unk> photographs, but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, like, data, <unk> data,
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> is a <unk>.
And to make sure that it's <unk> and not images, we can do something like that, to actually see that it's a real <unk> of the text, not a picture.
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a book.
I'm not going to <unk> it.
This is a <unk> example. This is a number of <unk>.
Every big picture is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the <unk> and the beautiful experience of the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk> <unk>.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the <unk>.
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much than that you use in a normal <unk>, and we've <unk> you of the <unk> content.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or even the <unk> <unk>.
And that really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
We think that this <unk> <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> similar, not to be <unk>.
Of course, <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say we have <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> over a NASA <unk>.
So now we're going to go to something else.
This is actually live on the web; you can see it.
It's a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> computer research very interesting computer computer computer computer <unk> of Washington, with the help of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. A <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive on the web, <unk> by <unk>.
You can see when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from a picture and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually actually have a meaning.
<unk> <unk> of <unk> computers have <unk> these images together, so that they <unk> to the <unk> <unk> that <unk> all near the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk>. Here you see some <unk> of a <unk> or <unk> <unk>, and these things have been all <unk> on the <unk>.
I don't know if I've got time to show you some other environment.
There are much more <unk>.
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> data <unk>, and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we've done for the first time, I <unk> to show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology, the <unk>. And it's not <unk> as <unk> looking at the <unk> that we've <unk> in the website.
We had to <unk> some <unk> <unk> and so on.
This is a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> images. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> and so on. <unk> of these <unk> <unk>, and so on. <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture.
So, they're all <unk> images and have been all <unk> on the <unk> level in this way.
And it's possible to <unk> this <unk> way.
You know, I would never have thought of <unk> to work to <unk>.
It's very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of <unk>: from those cell phones, a <unk> number, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can, I can, I'm going to go and look at those <unk>.
Many are <unk> by <unk>, etc.
And somewhere here is a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> to the <unk> view of this environment.
The <unk> point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now <unk> data from <unk> from the whole memory of how to <unk> the earth, from the <unk> of <unk> view and <unk> all that data together.
All of those pictures become <unk> together, greater than the <unk> of the parts.
You have a <unk> model of the entire <unk>.
Think about this as the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth.
It's something that <unk> <unk> <unk> as people <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> for those who are <unk> <unk> with the use.
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name, my picture, my picture of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of that data, and I can use as <unk> <unk> to space, in that <unk>, using the photos of anyone else, and having a social experience of <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of this is <unk> <unk> extremely <unk> of every part of the earth, <unk> not only from <unk> <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> and similar, but from the <unk> <unk>.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I got it right? What your software <unk> us to do is that at some point, in the next years, all of the photographs that's going to be <unk> together?
<unk>: Yeah. What's doing is basically <unk>.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's doing it in the content of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information that a lot of these images <unk>.
As you do a <unk> of images on the web, you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the page has a lot of information about the images.
Now, what happens if that picture <unk> all of your pictures?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous. It's a <unk> effect of the network.
CA: <unk>, it's really incredible.
<unk>: I'm going to tell you a lot.
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that we can live in who has no <unk> <unk> <unk>, among who <unk> the past in the wind, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> of plants.
You might think that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> beyond the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> of <unk>, or <unk>, the <unk> <unk> still the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, to remember the central <unk> of the <unk>, and that the idea that the world in which we live in there is no <unk>, but it's a <unk> of the <unk>,
the <unk> of a particular particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done, good or bad, a lot of <unk>.
And, of course, everybody's <unk> <unk>.
Everybody <unk>. <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
We have to deal with the death of death, so we don't <unk> it and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What I'm going to see is the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter whether the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk>.
He was my <unk> of a <unk> journey in <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, on the <unk>, the <unk> mother's <unk>.
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of to think, other ways of to move in the world.
And, if you <unk> a minute, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and is important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk>.
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk>, the <unk> of all of the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> in being from the human imagination of consciousness.
<unk> is the fantastic <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as <unk> species.
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk>, because it's <unk>, or on the <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> diversity -- and you don't even <unk> to the <unk> <unk> -- that of the <unk> diversity.
The <unk> of that is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A language is not only <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules.
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the middle of which the <unk> of every culture comes in in the material world.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, while we're here sitting here at least, half doesn't <unk> more <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They're no longer <unk> to children, which means that they're not going to <unk> something, which are already death.
What's more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk>, to be the last to talk about a language, of not having a <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the children?
This <unk> <unk> was a few weeks of the world every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks, a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know that somebody of you say, "<unk>'t that better?
The world wouldn't be a better place if we could all the same language? "<unk>, then we're talking to all <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> of a <unk> thing means that it doesn't talk about their language.
Today I'd like to make you a journey through the <unk> --
a little <unk> journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us will say that when I say, "I mean," I mean, "I really mean different ways of <unk>.
So, for example, this <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, who <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that's not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the <unk> time is <unk> in the forest, where the <unk> is <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule, <unk> <unk>. "<unk> <unk>": you have to <unk> a person talking different language.
All of this is <unk> in the past, the <unk> is that in these families that they're talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> no <unk>.
You start listening and then I'm going to talk about it.
And I had one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived with, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
They've <unk> from the top photographs that <unk> them in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest had never seen anything that <unk> forest.
They <unk> the pictures from the ground, they <unk> to find a <unk> or a <unk> and, and they didn't <unk>, they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But the <unk> don't only <unk> the <unk>.
They <unk> to each other.
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by their own.
We went to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> of death and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that he died <unk>, and then they <unk> it.
<unk> could recognize the animal <unk> 40 <unk> and <unk> the species.
In the early '<unk>, it was <unk> to me a very interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I was <unk> to <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> between <unk> society at the base of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to do <unk>.
To give a sense of <unk>, I should have understand the <unk> culture, and that the <unk> isn't <unk> <unk>.
It's quite a <unk> view of the world.
Very interesting.
If you're going to <unk> the big <unk> of the world <unk>, what would you like me?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent is always <unk> out, thinking that Africa doesn't have <unk> <unk>. And instead, it's not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes interesting is the <unk> relationship between life and death.
So <unk> are <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the live in such a <unk> that for a short moment the <unk> becomes the <unk>.
That's why the <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk> <unk> go to speak about God.
We <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> God. "
And since you're <unk>, is the spirit that <unk> you, how can you get <unk>?
So, you're going to <unk> these incredible events: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of the mind when it's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> all the <unk> that I lived with the <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of the <unk> civilization that once <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a blood continent, this <unk> never had been <unk> by <unk>.
And today I'm <unk> by a <unk>, but their education is extraordinary.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> from <unk> to four years, and they live <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> for 18 years of <unk> <unk> for 18 years.
Two <unk> of nine years <unk> about to <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
For that time, they're <unk> to the values of their society, values that they <unk> that their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
At the end of this incredible <unk>, they're <unk> out and for the first time, in their age of 18, see a <unk>. And in that moment of <unk> first, when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk>, everything that they've learned in a theory of the first <unk>, everything they've learned in a theory of his <unk>. The <unk> does a <unk> <unk> <unk>, and he says. The <unk> does a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>? <unk> like I said.
It's <unk>. Now it's going to be <unk>. "
They are <unk>, they call <unk> <unk>, and they say that we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world.
This is extremely important.
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment, and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> <unk> to the Earth of us.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk> by the <unk>.
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> of <unk>, but because of time and <unk>, created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk> not on the concept of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, but a <unk> <unk> <unk> -- the concept that the Earth can live only only because it's <unk> by human consciousness.
What does that mean?
Let me say that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> different and will have a very different relationship, and will have a very different relationship of the mountain or that <unk> <unk> <unk> that a mountain is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
<unk> is a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
That made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk>.
If we can <unk> that these <unk> can create reality, they can start to understand some of their <unk> <unk>. They can <unk> this <unk>.
I've <unk> this picture in the <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the <unk> potential of the <unk> of <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On one hand, this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk>'s family of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you're going to see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk>, the <unk> that's <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. It doesn't make a <unk> of reality; it creates the <unk> of reality.
I often <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with its discovery of <unk> <unk> in the '<unk>.
And my <unk> is not <unk> these <unk> as a <unk>, because if you're done you can't tell anybody to be <unk>. <unk>, but they can't be <unk> because they're <unk> by a <unk> that's of course in <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> only <unk> if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk>.
Now the <unk> is the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk>, the same <unk> <unk> to <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>: the <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>: in a <unk> of plants, how these <unk> <unk> <unk>, how do these <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk> not similar, but that if you <unk> in this way, they create a <unk> <unk> that's <unk> to the <unk> of the parts?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if we were to <unk>, we <unk> "The plants talk about it."
What does that mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>, who <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes will <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes will be in the same species.
If you <unk> their <unk> <unk>, they <unk> us, "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>." No. "
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> in a night of the moon and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk>.
And you don't <unk> to <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk> <unk>.
Now, the problem is that the ones that have <unk> the <unk> <unk> are <unk>, but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of the history of respect to our real world, and it's going to go through.
In fact, the <unk> century, 300 years, <unk> <unk>, not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk>, but rather as the <unk> of the <unk> of the diversity and <unk> and <unk> the mass of the diversity and <unk> <unk> of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> as much as the <unk> have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And if you look at the world, you'll see that these are not <unk> <unk>.
They are <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> from the existence of <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has been <unk> free in the forest until a generation ago, and now we're going to <unk> to the <unk> <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, where you can see the <unk> from the <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>,
We started to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in the case of <unk>, are disease disease that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk>.
If we're going to go on the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> of politics.
As a <unk>, the <unk> physics of a <unk>, is <unk> at the <unk> level, but the <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> life of a <unk>, not only is is not <unk>, but <unk> <unk> in some <unk>, because it's part of the development.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you go part of the beginning.
I've <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in the Western China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only got to <unk>. I realized what's behind the <unk> I was talking about.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people are <unk> by the <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
which means that it was <unk> at the <unk> of Chinese times.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that he brought the <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was being <unk>.
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at age two <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn't have to live without him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> and, for this <unk>, was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> for seven years.
The pain of <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> is from present.
And it was <unk> to a choice.
<unk> we live in the <unk> world of <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> of diversity?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk>, before they died said that his greatest fear was that it was that, in our going to go to this <unk> view of the world, not only <unk> the entire <unk> of the human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of thinking, but a day we're going to come from a <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, who has <unk> us to agriculture, which has <unk> us to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years.
That <unk> story, I didn't know that we have the answers to all the challenges that we could be able to be able to <unk> in the <unk> to come.
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human, <unk> with <unk> <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are: a <unk> species, which has to make all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there are great moments of <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the north of <unk> island, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and this man, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The government <unk> wasn't always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and the '<unk> to <unk> our <unk>, and we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man is <unk> of <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, and all of his <unk>.
You want to know that <unk> don't <unk> the cold, we <unk> it.
The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> fish.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> from night or <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> away, it <unk> the <unk> in the skin of <unk> and <unk> into your hand. When I did it <unk>, they <unk> it <unk> it into a <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, he <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, and he created a <unk>, <unk> <unk> a <unk>, <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> talk about <unk>? [<unk>] [<unk>] and that, in different ways, [<unk>] is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world.]
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the total of an area of <unk> larger <unk> of California and <unk> together.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. It's got all the resources.
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, finally, I think, is rather <unk> at least at least at the <unk> areas of the planet, <unk> that they are not at all.
For somebody is home.
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that we <unk> to the <unk> of the time. And for all of us, the dreams of these children, as the dreams of our children, they become part of the <unk> of hope.
And finally, we are <unk> that <unk> are <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything.
I'm going to say that the <unk> --
<unk> <unk> are not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our website <unk> <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public in <unk> to bring our public in places to <unk> <unk> from which they <unk> from <unk> how they saw and, <unk>, <unk> for <unk>, <unk>, in order to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> world of <unk> in diversity, and we have to find a <unk> life in the <unk> world.
that the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book, I hope that you've heard and you've heard of and <unk> some <unk> <unk>, in case, I don't <unk> them.
I'd like to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk>."
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> society. The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens" The way to do it is <unk> freedom <unk>. "
The reason is, on the side, in fact that freedom is itself a value, is <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for humans.
On the other one is that if we are <unk>, each of us can act to <unk> to do everything that we <unk> our <unk>, without any <unk> in name on our.
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> the choice.
More choices people have, more <unk> are <unk>, and more they are <unk>, more their <unk>.
This is, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> in the society that nobody <unk> to <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, without <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> that you can buy a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody of the <unk> <unk> is to your <unk>.
Here's what <unk> is.
Then you go to the <unk> store for buy a <unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> store, there's a big number of <unk> <unk>.
We can make six million and a half of different <unk> <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a <unk>.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice.
<unk> fields: the world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a child, you could get all the <unk> <unk> services, who were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
You're <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
One <unk> of that, by the way, was that the phone was never <unk>.
These days they went.
We have a <unk> almost <unk> <unk> <unk>, especially between cell phones.
Here are the cell phones from the future.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk>.
If you don't have seen it in the store under your house, you're <unk> <unk> that soon you're going to be <unk>.
And what happens is that people <unk> into the <unk> and it does this question. And you know, what's the answer is, "No."
You can't buy a cell phone that doesn't make things.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than the <unk>, they're <unk> the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: not happens in the United States you're going to go from the <unk> and the <unk> you're going to do.
Instead, you're going to go from the <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, you could do A, or <unk>," A, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>." "" <unk>, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>." What do you want to do? "
You asked them, "<unk>, what do you want to do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you said, "<unk> if you were me, what would you say?"
And the <unk> said, "But I'm not her."
The <unk> we call it "<unk> <unk>", "<unk>", "<unk>", "<unk> that makes it look like a nice thing.
But it's not that a <unk> the weight and the responsibility and the <unk> of the decisions from someone who knows something, <unk> the <unk>, to <unk> somebody who doesn't know about -- and it's certainly not <unk> -- and so that it's not in the <unk> to make the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk> products, <unk> to people like me and you, that if you think about it doesn't make sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why are we going to <unk> them?
The answer is that they want you to call the <unk> to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> of so fundamental as our <unk> is now a matter of choice, how you can see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> kids. We don't want to <unk> the kids. <unk>," <unk> <unk>. "<unk> <unk> a <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
which means that every <unk>, you have to decide what kind of person you want to be.
<unk> to the family and <unk>, a <unk> time perspective, <unk> perspective, <unk> almost anyone who was that <unk> us as soon as possible, and they <unk> to make their children as soon as possible.
The only real choice was with the people, not when, and even what to do after.
<unk>, everything is really to play.
They're going to be very smart, and they <unk> 20 percent less work respect to a time.
And not because they're <unk>, not because they're <unk>.
But why are they <unk>, they're <unk> to say, "<unk> <unk> or not?"
"<unk> <unk>. <unk> later? I have to think about it before the kids or <unk>?"
I'm <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this <unk> doesn't <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a nice <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, because technology <unk> us to work every minute, every day, every day, from every day of the planet, <unk> that from the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I won't say that nobody, where the <unk> works.
I'm not saying that, because I want to use it.
What does, this incredible freedom of choice of choice that we have about the work? Is we have to decide, <unk> at every moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go and see our child playing <unk>, with the cell phone in a <unk>, the <unk> in the other, and the <unk>, <unk>.
And even if I'm all <unk>, every minute we see our son, <unk> the <unk>, we're also <unk>, "<unk> to this call?"
"<unk> <unk> this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter? I <unk> it up?"
And even when the answer is "no," that makes this a <unk> experience of your son very different than what it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of us, we look at all, little objects and <unk> materials, life is a matter of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibilities, but it wasn't a <unk> issue.
The world today's <unk> to this: <unk> is a <unk> thing, "Is it <unk>, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
<unk> <unk> we all know, we know, so I'm going to talk about <unk>.
We're going to have this choice <unk> two effects of people.
The first one, <unk>, is that it <unk> instead.
With many <unk> between which <unk>, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I'll give you an example of a <unk> <unk>: a study <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of my <unk> has had access data of <unk>, the <unk> <unk> society, with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> companies.
What she found out is that every 10 <unk> that are <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> two percent.
<unk> 50 <unk>, there is 10 percent less than <unk> than when they are available. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> between which <unk>, is it <unk> difficult to decide, and choice is <unk> to <unk>.
And <unk>, and again, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course <unk>, <unk> never comes.
<unk> that doesn't mean just that these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don't have enough money, it means that the decision is so <unk> that you also <unk> the decision <unk> of work.
They're not going to be <unk> to <unk> <unk> for year from work, which would be well <unk> to <unk>.
So <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices.
And I think it's going to be the world.
"And finally, to end, to <unk>: <unk> or <unk>?"
You're going to have to make the right decision, if it's for <unk>, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong <unk>, and you <unk> the wrong <unk>.
So that's the first effect. The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice, at the end, we're less <unk> by the end of how they <unk> have been <unk> with <unk>.
And that's why I think about a number of reasons.
One of them is that with many <unk> <unk> between which you choose, if you take one and it's not perfect, is easy to imagine that you could make a different choice. And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> of the choice, and the <unk> <unk> by the <unk> decision,
even when it was a <unk> decision.
More choices there are more easy to <unk> than any <unk> <unk> that is <unk> of choice.
<unk>, there is what <unk> call.
<unk> has <unk> very well <unk> as the value that we give things to things that we <unk> with.
<unk> everything, when you have a lot of <unk> possible, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> is choice.
Here's an example. I'm <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York.
But that's what you probably <unk>.
There's this <unk> to the <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all about them.
I don't know. But what he thinks is, "Well, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are away."
"<unk> <unk> right in front of the house."
And it goes two weeks, we're going to have two weeks that it's going to be <unk> where it wants.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when the choice was <unk>.
And the more of the <unk> that we have from <unk>, the <unk> <unk> us <unk> against how <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about living the moment, and maybe it's going to be slowly.
But the most important thing is that anything you want, you're going to <unk> not to do other.
The things that don't have many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I tried it on my skin a new couple of <unk>.
It's almost always <unk>.
Once the <unk> were just a guy, <unk> them and <unk> <unk>, they were <unk>, only after <unk> <unk> a life <unk> a lot of times, and they started going well.
So, I went to <unk> a couple of <unk> when the <unk> <unk> went, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
And the <unk> said, "You want to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
You want them to <unk> or <unk>? "<unk>" or "<unk>"?
"<unk> <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk>? <unk> <unk>..." <unk> <unk>. "
I was <unk>, and after a little bit of <unk>, and I got the guy who was the only guy. "He didn't know what it was, so I was <unk> <unk>, and then <unk> from the <unk>, <unk>, and then <unk> from the <unk>, <unk>, and then <unk> from the <unk>, <unk>, and <unk>, and I had ever had.
It was <unk>. With all that <unk> choice.
But it <unk> me.
Why? I wrote a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't <unk> anything about <unk> when I had one guy, it was going to be <unk>, but when I had 100 different, it had to be perfect.
What I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After I <unk> that I was <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in life doesn't make people <unk> that they're <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> themselves.
And that's less <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Because if I <unk>, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more to that.
"He was better when he was worse." The reason he was better when he was worse, he was that when he was worse was possible to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world we live in -- <unk>, <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk>.
You never have to <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>" Yes, "you want it."
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- that I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I couldn't <unk>.
But <unk> don't always have a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk> of the buy a couple of <unk> <unk> when there is just that when you're not <unk>, and I'm going to tell you, "Why?"
"Who is <unk>?" <unk> is <unk>.
The world is <unk>. What could I do?
When you have hundreds of <unk>, and you'll have one <unk>, and you'll have one <unk>, and you'll know who's the <unk>, it's clear that the <unk> are you.
You could have done better.
With hundreds of <unk> <unk>, there are no <unk> for <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even if the result is <unk>, they <unk> <unk> and give them the <unk> to their own own.
In the last years, the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have experiences because the standard are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think that they're in their own.
So the final result is that we're better, <unk>, but we get worse.
Let me show you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we're going to take for it and it's completely <unk>.
There is no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all, but it doesn't make much better than that a little bit better than that.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm quite sure we've been <unk> by a piece of the level where the choices are <unk> our life.
Now, from the <unk>'s point of view -- I almost finished -- from the <unk>'s point of view, the <unk> is the <unk>.
What it allows all this choice in society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you know, <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice.
The problem is they have too much <unk>.
So the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And what <unk> does and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> talked to you yesterday about how much those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean, these choices, <unk> and <unk>, is not that just <unk>.
I'm <unk> <unk>.
They make us worse.
If a little bit of what we could do is in our society that <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people are too few possibilities, it wouldn't just their life, but our.
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of income is good at all -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us.
And to end, "<unk>, you can become everything you want."
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>: "What's going to do that fish?"
"It's <unk> that you can't make anything in a glass <unk>."
"A <unk> imagination, a <unk> view of the world --"
and I <unk> it like this, at the beginning.
But then, I'm <unk>, I realized that the long knows that the fish knows.
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk>, so that "everything is possible," you can't <unk> the freedom. You <unk> the <unk>.
If you <unk> the <unk> so that it could <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
Everybody needs a <unk>.
This is almost certainly certainly too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and, <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you very much.
