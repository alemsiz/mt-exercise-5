The last year I showed these slide to show that the glacial calculation that for almost three million years has had the size of 48 million years has been the sized 48 percent of the United States of 48 percent of the 40 percent of the United States of 40 percent of the United States of 48 percent of the 48 percent of the United States of the 48 percent of the
However, this subsilacium, because it doesn't show the ice of ice because it doesn't show the ice of ice ice because it doesn't show the ice of ice because it doesn't show the ice of ice because it doesn't show the ice of ice because it doesn't show the ice of ice because it doesn't show the ice of ice because it doesn't show the ice of ice because it doesn't show the ice of ice ice ice ice because it doesn't show the ice of ice ice as the ice as the glacium.
The art glacial clean art is, in a sense, the clear clean of the global climate system.
It turns out the winter, and you get right.
The next slides will be a quick recently revenues of the last 25 years.
The glacack lost are drawed in red it.
As you see, you expand the blue scream.
That's the ice in the winter in the winter winter of the sumer record.
You can see that the glacious ice glacious glacious glacious -- it's like the blood of the body.
In 25 years was going to be like that, in the case.
This is a problem because the interesting land the art of the ice around the ocean artic where there are huge quantities of carbon of congelate that shared carbon that mycept that they come from microbies.
Redspain the totality of the pollution of global warming, that quantity could radicate that pollution would be doubling this point of doesn't return out this point of not return.
In some of the lake of a deep-deep, in Alaska the metang is already reboiling from water.
The professor. Katey Walter of the University of Alaska has rected team a team, a based team of last deliver.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: Wow! She's good. The question is if we well.
A reason this is that this termic surrise on the Greenland of the north.
This is a river.
The taken never reached levels.
This is the Kangerlusaq, in the south-west Greenland of the Greenland
If you want to know how the ski level of the gather, the slide of level of the level of the level of the sea sket.
These rents are increasing rapidly.
From the other part of the planet: Antarcts, the biggest block of the planet.
The scientists have declared the balance of ice is in neglacior is in negative and that the Antarcts, which is particularly rapid in some islands, is particularly rapid in the shared shelter.
And the queen of water levels of water, like in Greenland --
The Himalaya, the third largest block of ice block glays, which few years again -- they were ice.
The 40 percent of the world received population from the pollage of the pollage from the slides.
Sulles Ande: this glacier is the source of this city.
The taken is increased.
But when you diminished, the same acks to poctable.
In California the neve Sierra Nevada is decrectly four percent
The ydriers are in crisis.
The predictions, like you have red, are grave.
The growing growth in the world door a remarkable increases in the world is increasing the world
The environmental disasters are increasing to a recording out of the normal and precedent.
Four times more number in the last 30 years of the last 30 years of previous to previous 75.
This is a whole thing of insustainable to it.
If you look at the context of the history if you can see the consequence.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the point of the oriental Pacific East America, from the obvious observices of the subbent of the continent, where there's a radical impositional of oxygen in the oceans.
The major of global warming, together with deforestation, together which is the 20 percent, is the use of fuel of fossil.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries to China.
And it was proposed to build a lot of other carbon disease.
But we're assisting to a change of direction.
These are annononothing in the last few years and some of the veries of veryal alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative projects and some of the alternative alternative projects and some of the alternative alternative projects and some of the alternative alternative alternative projects in the
At the way, there's a political lotate in our country.
The carbon and of oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote clear carbon that clean oxymore.
The image reminded me reminded me to do something --
Natal, in the Tennesse, where there was a 3.8 billion ger less, where there was a 3.8 billion gers.
Maybe you saw it about the news of the news.
This is the second biggest scores in America.
It's happened around Natmains around Natmain.
The natalizing of one of the carbon industry was this:
Video: Man: Frosty carbon is a type and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it grow our economy.
Frosty the carbonaio is increasingly clean more and more clean more clean more clean is increasingly clean.
It's precise to the precise and workers keep the stick.
Al Gore: Gore: Gor: Go a lot of West Virginia.
The largest society on the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his amministrator.
Video: Don Blankhenship: I will be clear, Nancy Peloce, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Proteon the Clima has launched two campaign.
This is one of it.
Video: Attor: All right: All rights, we see the climate change as a mination to our business.
And so our priority is investing a great amount of money in a public effort to make the remarkable of the carbon and confused the truth on carbon.
In fact, the carbon is not spore.
We think it's pulet -- it has a good profum.
So not preocourage of climate change.
Let me do you now.
Video: All right: Carbone -- you heard about a lot of the time.
So let's take a game structure at a framework for how it is about the carbon of the clean to clean to the carbon disease.
Straordinary cars are a little while, but this is the sound of the technology of carbon technology.
The carbon is between the main the main causes of global warming, but the remarkable technology of carbon that you see changes everything.
You look at the ey: this is the hodiernal technology of carbon technology.
Al Gore: Finally, the positive alternative positive to the economic issue and the national security.
Video: Comment: The America is in crisi; the economy, national security climatic.
The film that the colleges all of the ones that are the recordner of fossil fuel and the oil is the carbon and the oil is important.
Now, there's a new audance to usution for using circle.
Repower America, 100th percent of clean energy in decade years.
They plan to put the America, to make the work, to make sure and help them stopping the global warming.
Finally, a solution that you have to solve our problems.
Repower America. You buy more.
Al Gore: This is the ultim.
Video: Comment: Have you to America.
One of the fast fast enough ways to get dependence from the combustible combustid our planet.
Sowever, the future is here. I sole, one new energy network.
She shot number 2: Noves investment investment for places to work well.
M: Repower America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old African old proverbable African proverble-fast African one.
If you want to go away to the away together."
We have to go away quickly.
Thank you very much.
The year last year at TED fect on LHC.
And I promise to go back to how the machine.
So here I got it. And for those ones that the other time there is no her, LHC is the biggest scientific experiment of the scientific miles of circumstom.
His to reach the conditions that were present less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe, at 600 million times a second.
And that's all of this is just environment.
This is the underneath Geneva.
We photographers of these mini-Big Bievators.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's a 44 feet and has a 22 feet of feet of 22 feet --
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
The 10 seeptember last year we have access the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immenses festablished in the control.
It's a picture of the first particles that had done all the game of the LHC, entering collision, and spread to a part of the LHC, and spread particles inside the LHC, and spread particles inside the relief of the first of the LHC, and spread particles in the LHC, and spread particlevator.
In other words, when we see that picture the 10 of the 10th-ember machine, we understand that the machine working, which is a great liftyle
I don't know if it was to do it more or more or this is going to Google and saw that the beginning was this one.
That means we had a cultural impact of the scientific impact to that scientific impact.
And it was a week later, there was a problem with the machine, he had to these files -- these sleeps -- these movies -- these movies -- these sleeps of the sleep.
These files bring 13,000 prints when the machine works at the massive power.
Now, the technical of you look at the movies and say, "It's not true. I'm files too under thyli."
And they can do it because when they're very cold is become the superconvicts.
So, at least 271 degrees, to a nurse temperature of the space, these files can bring that corrup.
In one of the most of the top of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the files were surrise to the read of the movies of 13,000 ample ample meeting a resistence of electric resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive than 20 tons are about about 30 tons -- and that was moved about 30 centimeters.
They have about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to you, what we did we do it.
We have pristined and add them and adjusted.
They're now now now they're returning to the ground.
And the end of the marg LHC is going to be new integrated integrated integry.
We're going to accenate it, and we expect of the data or slue, and keep our wind or slumn, and so our adventure to discover what the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain fourth of the science and engineering the science and engineering to the science and engineering. It's eeasy to confuture.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to beyond the limits, I think it's the value of things like LHC.
I want to end with the words of a scientist Ingless, Humphrey Davy, what, in defense of inuseful experiments of his pull, his pullo was Michael Faray, he said, "No much dangerous is so dangerous to progressss' ideas that are definitive in nature, and the ideas that are definitive as that are definitive in nature, and the money of the square are completing money in nature, and the World Worless,
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to think about that, by children, to play here, by children, played with matter matter to the holding morning.
And while you realize them and reach them and reach them and realized them and moving them to think and resolve them to think and solve problems and manipulating relationships.
The reason is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us.
So, as informed informed by using the usual usual objects, together to my consults, and my collaboratory and my collaborator Jeevan Kalaniths, I started to ask myself to have the computer, instead of the mouse as well-hydgital with entertaining a mouse as a pastres of information with both entering entrameworks,
and we can put it on our please?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided to explore the answer to the answer to the answer to the answer to the answer to the answer to the answer to the answer to the answer to the answer to the answer to the answer to exploring the answer to the answer is that we decided to exploring the answers, building the Siftable.
In pounds, a Siftable Siftable computer is a very big discover.
In pounds, a Siftable Siftable computer is a very big discover.
You can move with the hand, they can see ""We're the movement of them, and they have a wireless.
But most of the point, they are physics, like matter matter to be just to reach them go.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information.
And as they become more physics, and as a motion, and as they get more physics, and as they become more physics, and as they become more physics, and others, like that, we can exploring new and functions of interaction.
I'm going to start with some example.
This Siftable is configured to show the video -- if you including it in a direction, the video will go back to the other side back.
These interactive riticians are aware of the others.
If they are in the case of what they are going to be around it.
If they come circumstom, and they can agitate a little bit.
If they come circumstom, and they can agitate a little bit.
They also have their movement and incline.
We realized that one of the implications of the interaction was the power to use gestures of the data, to example "See a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated secs and I can use them to go to the colors in the central mix.
and I can use them to use them to the color, where they mix of the central where they mix they mix of the color.
If we were too much of it, we can put it on the him.
There's also beautiful chance of learning, like math and games of logical logical and games where people can try the things quickly, and see the immediately.
I'm going to be --
This is a Fibonacus that I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a game of words that is half between Scarabeo and Boggle.
First, in the top of the turns out to every Siftable, Pratically, to every turn Siftable, and then you get a letter on every Siftable, and as you try to get words on a dictionarie.
Then, about 30 seconds remissing and you have a new set of letting and new chance of lectly and new possibility to try to it.
Thank you.
Here's the children came to the Media Lab, I did it such them and I went to a video.
They are loved a lot of them are please.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of education --
You just say, "The Compons of words, and they know exactly what to do.
Here's some other people who tried it.
This is our most giving younger beta younger head of the right right there.
It just wanted to be actually actually clumps them.
They just were bricks, for him.
Now, this is a interactive application of a interactive application of it.
We wanted to build a tool of the appreciation of the Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, relieving the Siftable to their own associats.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, relieving the Siftable to their own associats.
So, it's doing the sun.
Video: The sole is gen.
David Merrill: She's taken a treat in the scen.
Video: The treat one.
Good work. Yes!
So schooling Siftable and put them together can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
and inventing their story.
Video: Cao!
DM: It's a story with the open-open and it can decide him.
DM: It's a story with the open-open and it can decide him.
Video: Vole, you know, the take.
DM: The last example I have the time to show you is a tool, recently recently to pample, to pample, and to be music.
it's a tool, recently recently for recently and exective music.
The Siftable here are playing sound like based and bacteria.
Each one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what it is.
You can insect these sound sound to be able to your sequence to your floor.
And it just making it a sound just to touch a sound."
These are effects that you can control from living, like reverber, like reverber, and the filter.
The attacks to a particular south, and then including it to add it.
And then there are the general effects like and volume, which is applicate to the entire sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to start with a base in two Sift" sequence, we get to the extensive to the extensive the half of the base.
Now I put a baside.
Video: DM: Oh, I'll add the ussion of ussion,
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control effect from live.
Video: DM: I can fast the entire sequence inclinking the time from one side or the other.
Video: DM: And I'll add the movie to the base to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombining the sequence of the volution of the vol."
So I don't have to planning it before, but I can improvise, making it more longer or more stronge.
And finally, I can actually get the whole sequence including the entire sequence inclinking on the left Siftable "volumme."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new interface to build new interface that our brain and more more like our brain and body.
And I have time to show you one of the results of the results of this lot, and some of the opporting of this lock out of the lab.
The concept that I want to transmit you to this new generation of objects to interact with digital media design of information in our world that will let information in our world that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the hour of hour to talk to you about all of you.
I'm a writing of it.
She writing books is my professional except is more of that, obviously.
It's also the love and the faset of my life.
And I don't expect that can change
But I said, something of particular was recently in my life and my life and my career and my career recently recalibrate with this work.
The particular thing is that I recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Ama" -- the different thing from my previous previewing out of the world and become a big sensational.
And the result is that everywhere you go to now, people are treating me as if I were convicted to me.
It true -- convicted convict!
They come from me and they all worried and say, "You don't have to be afraid more to do it?
You don't fear to keep writing to write all of life without any life that can create a book that can be able to create a book that importing to someone?"
which can matter someone?"
It's reassure -- you know.
But it could go worse, I think about 20 years ago, I remember over 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was an adolescent -- I wanted to be a write of the trice.
I was going to meet the same reaction from the fear.
And people told me, "Don't be succeed?
Don't you fear that the humbiting you kill?
You don't fear of doing this mester mestures all the life without any life that comes out and die on a heart of sken heart of sken with the mouth of sweet, with the mouth of fall?"
So you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is, "Sy."
I fear of all of these things.
I always had to be fear.
And I also fear of many other things that people might not have to meet it.
As a and other scary.
But as I can be about the writing the what I thought and I wonderful is why is:
Is it ration?
It's logical that anyone who have to be scared by a work that you feel feel that you feel feel that you feel out of the work that you feel to do
But what is that we can particular in the impresses cret to make us to the mental health of the mental health career in a way that other career doesn't do?
How my father, for example, he was a chemistry and I don't remember, and I don't remember in his 40 years of activity where he was closed if he was going to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be able to be engineer to be able to be able to be able to get capit?
There was never -- that the engineer Johnn, like that?
Do it works?
Onestly, chemical engineers don't have certainly in the centuries, the reputation of being alcohythmics of being alcoholed maniacs.
We writers, we have enough this reputation, and not just the writers but creative of all kinds of things we have this reputation of being enormously instable.
And it's not rest that look at the contact of the magnant of the magnant deaths that only in the 2th century, they have young people and often for them to mand often for them to them.
And the ones that don't have suicidated to be really disspread to their womans.
Norman Mailer, before she dies, the last interview said, "Or my book is killed me killed a little bit more about your life of life.
But we don't have to be able when we heard these things so long as we heard about this is so much that somehow we were totally interior, and the notion that creativity and the nice are somehow to recognition and that art the range and art the art anguy in the angoodse.
And the question I want to ask all of the today is, are you agree with this ideas?
It goes you have this -- because I also look at it from a centimeter of me distance to me -- it doesn't good for anything this suppose.
I think it's hodious.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see perpetuate in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great minds.
And I sure in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to be able to become out of my broad, the circumstances where I have in my career.
And it's just -- I look at it, I am rather young people -- I have about 40 years.
I have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely anything to write about what I will write to be judged by the world like that work that was going to be right after the scared of my last book.
I'm going to be skity, because we are all more or less friends here -- it's likely to my greatest successful is to my shouldn't be in my shoulders.
Oh, Gesus, that think!
You know this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to begin to begin to nine mornning, and I don't want to do it.
I would keep doing this work that we love.
So, the question becomes from?
And so I seems to me, after many reflections, which the way to work to keep to do is to create a psychological costruck structural cook?
I have to find a distance of security between me, which I am writing to me, and my natural anks on which is going to be able to get E, while I was trying to get out of the way to do it in the time to look through the time to be begin to look through the time to see if they could have some other societies to see if they could have more health ideas that they could have more health and health health and
how to help creative people to manage to manage emotional inerents of creativity.
And that research took me to the ancient Grecia and ancient Romma.
You seguitems because I turn to go back and then comes back and then comes back back back and come back and come back and come back and then comes back to some of the sket.
In the ancient Grecia and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity came from men from men from men OK?
And it was thinking that creativity was this is about the divine and that came to men from some surface, for some surface, for some surface, for the distant distant distant distant and unknown out.
The greety is these spirits of the demons."
Socrate, wonderful, he believed to have a demon that elargiving wisdom.
The Romans were the same idea, but they called the kind of spirit without body.
The thing is great because the Romans didn't think that a geniy of a geniy was someone particularly smart genius was someone particularly smart geniy was somebody particularly smart geniy was someone particularly smart geniy that a geniy is a kind of a particularly smart geniy that is a kind of smart.
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that you believed in the walls of the study of a artist, a little bit like the elpho Dobby, and that came out of the artist, and that was out of the artist of the job and model, and model, the result of that work.
Eccectional -- that's the distance of which is the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construction that you protect you from your work.
And everyone knew that was so that it was so that worked, right?
So the antic artists were protected to certain things, like for example, right?
If your work was exceptional work was exceptional to the market, everybody knew that was helped by this incorporate genius.
If your work failure, it wasn't all of your fail, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inability to be a inability.
And so people han conceived the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then the Rinascise came and all changed and it changed, and the nacive this idea; we put the human being; we put the human beings and without more leaving and without more leaving and without more and no longer and without the divinity.
This was the principle of the rational of human across the rest of human and people began to think that creativity from the ispspspace.
And for the first time in history, he began to referring or that artist as a kind of genius like a fairly that a person with genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think that allowing someone -- a simple person to believe being like a foundation, and the source, and the sisters of all the mysteries and the amount of inconnectivity, unknowable, inconnectivity, and unknowing the human fragile to human fragile fragile of human beings.
It's like to ask someone of the ingoid to the sun the sun.
Deform and completely the ego and creates all these ingestiable expectations on performance.
And I think it was this pressure to destroyed the artists in the past.
And if this is true, and I think the question becomes and now?
Can we do it different?
And you look at a more ancient understanding of the relationship between human and creative and mystery creative.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't cell about 500 years of ractional thinking in a 18 minutes.
And there are probably people in the audience that would be relief to the scientific nesses on the notion of the notion of people are going to be able to fabulated successful their projects.
I probably don't think I will start all of this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why I know.
Why don't you think it in this way?
Because it has more sense of all the other thing that has ever heard to explain the exasperant process.
A process that as anyone who ever ever tried to do something -- so basically, all of here -- yes you don't behave.
And in fact, it can sometimes like a completely paranormal paranormal
I made this meeting recently with the amazing poeter Ruth Stone, who has now 90 years, but it was a poet, and he told me that during his infection in the rural Virginia, worked out in the reality, and I was working out in the glands of the landscape.
He told me that it was like a tremendous tren.
And that was coming up to her landscape of the landscape.
It was to get to the below his face taken under his feet.
He knew to have one thing to do to the point and it was to say, "to run how a morn."
And so he was going to be moving to the house and was followed by this poem and he wouldn't make other piece of paper and a quickly enough in a quickly quite quite quite a fast slide and to reach it on the page.
Other people could come up enough to be quick, so corrective, and it was running and the recorded and poem to get to the rolled rolled through and she would keep rolled through and she would keep rolled through the lands and she would keep rolling through the landscape and the rest of the other hetry and the rest of the other poetry."
And then there were those times -- this piece of piece of the time I will never forget -- there were the moments that the nearly lose --
So, he was running at home and he was trying to card and the poem was going to go through and go through the one and was a matter, and then he said, that was like it was going to be away with the other hand and the gaxis and the gaxis and the off.
And he was the poem from the coda and the reputs and the recognized the page.
And in these cases, the poem would be presented on the perfect and intact to the first -- the last word to the first before.
So when I heard -- it's crazy, it's exactly the same way to my creative process.
Not all my creative process -- I am not a convict!
I'm a mule, and my work to work and I can see it up, and I can see me at the same day, and south and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on on the good.
But even io, in my head, I went to my knew, I went to the thing, sometimes.
And I guess that even many of you have the han didd.
You know, even if the work and ideas I came to give me a certain sources I could not honestly know.
What is this thing?
And how can we relate to the same way that we don't have the head, rather than head, rather than sanis?
And as I really, the best example I have is the Tom Musician musician I have a Tom Waits, which I interview for a day.
We were talking about that, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the major life was the incarnation of the contemporary artist of the contemporary artist of creative impulses these impulses of ems creative impulses of creative impulses of creative life of the emporary artist of life is the incarnation of the life has been the incarnation of the life was the incarnation of the life has been the incarnation of the contemporary artist, and
But then he was a little bit of it, and a day while he was driving on a hope-up and he changed all of him.
It was going to be quickly and a track of this little fragmental fragment, which comes into his head as inspiration, and elusive and allecty, and the want, you know, it's wonderful, and the desige, you know, and the desire, but it doesn't know how to take it.
It has no piece of paper, it doesn't have a matter, it doesn't have a matter.
So it begins to feel this kind of old old old old is growing in him and I will be able to lose and I'll be obsessed by this song lost of this song lost of it.
I'm not enough enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to stop in the panic choice.
And he went to the whole mental process and he did something completely new one.
And he looked at the sky and said, "Scuse, you can't see I driving I do?"
"To seems that can write a song now?
If you really want to exist, you go back to a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
Other address, you go to to someone else today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process changed after that.
Not the work, the work was still dark as the seed.
But the process, and the anxiety was released when the genius was released when the genius that was that the genius that problems and libered it out, and realizing it was going to come back to where he was was a interior.
but well, this is a great conversation of the raising bizarre conversation a conversation of Tom and this strange thing that was not Tom.
So I heard that that began to change a little bit of the way I worked and I was already to me a time.
This idea, I was going to write "Mangia, Prega, Ama," and I fall, and I falling in one of those dispersing of the disperation where we are working on something and we can't get to be a disaster, which is going to be a book, which is going to be a disaster, which is the worst of the dispersent book.
Not just bruty, the worst written written --
And I started to think about designing this project.
But then I remind the Tom that I talked to the air and tried.
So I went to my face on the handle of my hands and I would say my comments to a listance of the room.
And I said to you, "Yes, both both both thing, both both that if this book is not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliold, right?
Because as I see I am going to put all of what I have, I don't have more about that.
So if you want it to be better and make your party.
Okay. But if you don't do anything, I don't know anything.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to do that I have been recorded to today I have presented to my part, I think it's like that, I was actually -- sitting in the deserts of the North people drunning to the moon and the top of the moon, and the sacred and sacred sacking for the hours and to the today that they were going to hours and the hours and to the high hours and the hours to the high and the hour, and the high to the high of the hour, and the hours of the sacros
And they were always magnific because the ballery ballery were professional and they were fantastic.
But every one time, rarely, and one of these artists became to be actually translent artists in reality.
And I know what I know about it, because I know that you have all seen everybody, to a point, a performance like that.
It was like the time stop, and the ballery walking and walking a kind of loud and was not doing nothing different from from the soliter, like 1,000 night -- but all of all the way that was all of the half of it was in the half of the hundred things.
And suddenly in the suddenly as a human human human being.
But you access, and under and under the diline of the divinity of divinity.
And when this happened, the time was the time, people knew what was called her name, they were called his name.
They were coming the hands and they started singing, "Ah, God God, God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know.
And he note name -- when the Morors invaded the south of the Spain, and they were going to take this habited in the centuries of the centuries of the centuries of "Ah, Allah, who's still or in the corriddling or in the corrids, or in the corrids or floating in the corner of the corridds,
In Spain, when an artist has made something impossible and magic -- and magic -- "Oh, magic painting, and I mean -- a shot of God.
And it's great because we need it.
But the problem comes the down, the door of the ballery is when you wake up and discovers that are the 11 a.m. And the last last few of Martedday and the last of God don't have more.
It's just a death, with the news of the knee, and maybe it will never be able to achieve that height.
And maybe no one dog will be the name of God while it's going to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life
But maybe it doesn't have to be so anguy that you can not believe that it doesn't believe -- that the most amazing expects of your being come from from you from you to yourself to be there.
But believe it is just that they come from a intive instead of this squisite of your life that squisite part of your life that you have to get to someone else when you find.
And you know, if we think of it changes.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's certainly as I thought for several months during the work of the book that I will be prest, the dangerous chas, hopefully followed my great success.
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electric electric is not path.
Don't further the pay of your work.
It takes you to be able to you, whatever you can be.
If your work is ball, ball, ball, ball.
If the divine, you know, I measure to leave some kind of wonderful to leave some kind of wonderful time through your effort, and just "Ole!"
Other of triments, you do the same tub.
And "Ole!" to yourself the same.
I think I think I have to teach it.
"Ole!" to yoursel, just for yourself to love and test talks to the square of the talks to do you always always always seeing.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've been talking about some of these projects on human genome on the human genome of gene to the set of genes.
We're now beginning a new path of it, we started to digitalize biology and now from that code to digital code of biology, and designing life and synthetic synthetic and synthetic synthetic and synthetic life.
We always tried to take a big questions.
"What is life is a lot of biological biological biological biological to understand various levels.
We tried to be approach, reducing it to the minimum minimates.
We're digitalizing from almost 20 years hour.
When we sequenced the human genome of the human genome of the biology of the biology of the biology world.
Now we ask us, we can regenerate the life, or create new life from this digital?
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the smallest genome of those that can authoreplicate in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create the genome to create a little bit more smaller.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of the around 500 genes of genes are here.
But when we look at his metabolic map of metabolic map of the now.
And so that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminat, one to the time, it's very imlikely that this can bring to a live.
So we decided the only view to progress is synthesizing this chromosomes so that we could modifit to get some of these questions.
And so we started the wind of "Can we synthetic chromoso?"
Can the chemistry of producing these big molecules that we never could create before?
And in the case of gras, we can make a chromoso-?
A chromosome, is just a piece of chemical material.
The speed with which we are able to digitalize life is growing up to exponential exponential resource.
Our ability to write the genetic code, rather progress rather slowly lessly, but it's better dealing.
And our most recently recently the door recently recently the door to the exponential curve.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has requires a lot of passing with a biothic review review of the first experiments.
But we discovered that synthesize DNA is very difficult to be very difficult.
There are thousands of machines of machines in the world that small segments of DNA, of 30 to 50 to 50 length of length of 30 to 50 length is longer than the segment is longer laps, the longer laps are there.
So we had to develop a new methodd to assemble these fragments and correct the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of these fragments and correct the middle of these fragments and correct the middle of the midddle and correct the middle of the mid
And this was our first attempt to be a digital information of the genome of Phi X 174.
It's a little viruses that killed batterys.
We designed the fragments, effect the correction of the errors and got a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 letters.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inert material and we put it in the bacterial battery and they started reading this genetic code and producing this genetic code of virals.
The particles are then released by cells, they went back to cells, and they have been back and destroyed the E.
I talked about recently with recently oil industry saying, they certainly understanding this model.
They have more than you are.
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build his hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things in big things.
We wanted to build the entire chromosome.
I'm over 580 miles of the genetic code of genetic code of genetic code.
So we thought we built it in the size of viruses of viruses, so that we could change cassets to understand what the components are a living cell.
The project is crucial information is crucial, and we start with digital information in a computer, these are must be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate to digital information in a computer, these are dealthic information in a computer, these are must be very accurate to digital information is very accurat
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accuratezed was a mibasic error, was of a 10,000 mibasis.
We discovered, resequencing it, 30 errors. If we had used that original sequence we never were able to do it work.
A part of the process is to design segments that are overwhelming with all the other segments of 50 letters of 50 letters of labor to build underneath tiny together.
We do objective elements here.
You probably read that we read the phylie.
Think about that we have a based genetic code genetic code on four letters: A, C, GGGs and T.
Three of those letters together codifying about 20 loves, and there's a specific order to lettle for every load.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, thoughts.
What we did we do in the beginning was audience.
Some of the fact that it was not poem to be poeking.
We designed these segments to be able to just uniquely uniquely with it.
There are gain that they repair them and put them asyet.
And we started assembling the particular of the parts, starting with five to seven milles, undrifts to fort 24 miles of lectly led to them to get to 72 miletter to 72 miletter to 72 millletter to segments to get to 72 miletter to get to 72 miles the letter to get to 72 mi
We have produced these segments in above abundance to sequence them so that we are trying to make a very robbust of create a tremely robbust -- as you see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems the tabellon a basket.
When we get to these very longments, more than 100 miles and more than 100 mibasis are going to grow more directly in E. coline in E. colabs.
It comes to the limited tools of the modern biology of the molecular biology.
So we considered other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called recombination of homology to repair the biology of using DNA in the biology of the segments.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radio durans, it can absorb three million rad rad of ran rad of ran than three million ran rad rad of radication.
You can see in the high school, like his chromosomes are destroyed.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reased exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can be completely.
They can live under empty.
I'm absolutely sure that life exists in space, and you moving to find new environments of water.
In the fact, NASA showed that this availing this starting.
This is a picture of the molecular that we built using these process, just by using these process, by by the design appropriate appropriate to the design appropriate segments.
The lievidence of the automatically.
This is not been taken with a microscope with a electronic microscope rule.
It's a molecular molecule, so we can see it with a microscope of the law.
These are pictures that covery a period of about six seconds.
This is the advertising we did a little time ago.
I'm over 58,000 lectly genetic code of genetic code
It's the biggest of a structure that has ever created by man.
It has a weight molecular high schools.
If we spend it with a 10 carattle of a ten 10 pages, there would just be 142 pages to turn this genetic code this genetic code.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we active?
Of course, you can track a viruses is a girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use the batteries.
It's also more simply when it's treatment cells as our eucarios as our res: you can just extract the nucleus and insert another one of the clonation.
In the bacterial archaea is instead of integrated into the cells, but we recently demonstrated that we are able to do a complete transplant from a complete cromosome, and to another and active it from a cell and activate it.
We purifted a microbial chromosome.
The two are different as men as the men from the topis.
We add some genes in more way that we could decide what choosing to this chromosom for this chromosom --
The one one has the gap with the gases to killing all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cells of the cells was wonderful -- and you just appreciate our softwo-sticato-cell phone.
And we started thinking we couldn't go beyond that, but we tried to be more in the ways.
This is one of the most mechanisms of evolution.
We discovered that many species have added a second or a second or a third of some partners, to add a second or a thousands of new tracks of new tracts to that species.
So who thinks about evolution as just a gene to evolution as a gene of modifies of the biology.
There is gerisms called restriction of restrial restriction is that fit DNA.
The chromosome, it was in the cells that was in the cell.
The cellphon-crum, the cromosome, we have inser-ha.
And it turns out and recognized the other chromosome, and it has masticked it and we recovered with only the cells and the new chromoso.
it's became blue blue because of the genes we have insert.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of one species are gaded, and it turned out to the new species, the new species, the new species, the new species, which we put in the cell.
All the protein are changed, and membranes are changed, and when we read the genetic code of exactly what we transfer to what we transfer to you.
Now, this may look at genetic alchemy genetic altering DNA we can change the things in enough enough of this is sustaining things enough sustic.
Now, I have already explained that you don't talk about genesis -- but of evolution, and I told that maybe we are to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's enough obvious when we think about our necessarily to our essential knowledge.
We're going to go from six billion and half a billion in the next 40 years.
I was born to give an example, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946, in 1946, in 40 years, there are going to be four.
We're doing this problems now to find food problems and clean fresh and clean and clean inal billion people.
It will be harder to do it for nine billion.
We are more than five billion carbon dibon dibon disease.
That means a million barbarels a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process, or any kind of process to replace them, it will be a huge challenge of it.
And we have to keep in the hemission of all of CO2 emission of these materials that end up in the atmosphere.
At the day, thank you to scientific discoveries all over the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are designed for the future.
The electric industry has only only one dozen about components, and think about how many different things came out of it.
Our limits here are data from reality and our imagination.
We now have the techniques, thank you to these quick methody methody in creating what we call genomics.
We are able to build a big robot that can produce a million hundred chromosomes to the day.
Think about processing these 20 million different genes or to try to get the processes to produce the processes to produce or drugs, and we can change a little thelam, and and create biology and create biology and create biology now that in the last 20 years.
And it's just a standard.
We can choose to survive, for the chemistry of survival, chemistry or carbon and of vaccines --
This is an instantanee of some software programmed to be able to seat us and designing species to be able to sit and designing species to the computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they will be it.
We know exactly how their genetic code.
We're now focusing on the carbon of quarter-generation.
You also saw you to extract etanoling it was a matter experiment of the finish.
We have a second carbon and third generation that will come pretty soon as well as the top, as the higher as the eight of skills like the eight types of butans.
But the only way biology can have a great impact without major major major the food of the food and limited the diseases of food would be transforming CO2 in the matter of the primate that we can reach this discovery, and we think we could have the primate about 18 months.
The solar light with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries all the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean deep, about 2500 feet of deeping of the water.
It made from CO2 using hydrogen using molecular as source source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can be able to figure CO2, which can easily be transported to be transported to be transported to drive this process.
So we think that short we might be able to increase what base base the basic question of "What is life, truly is Now, versus -- we have the obillion to repiring the oil industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do?
It would become a main of energy.
And yet, we're working for using the same methods to create vaccinistant vaccines.
You saw this year with the influence, we are always backyard, and a dollar, and a dollar, in under when it's treating the right vaccine to find the right vaccine to be flu.
I think that that that it can change building vaccinable vaccinable in ancient ancially.
Here's how the future could begin to change it, the evolution, the evolution, the evolution, accelerating the evolution, and indeed, and infinally cells.
We are so so much to improve people.
Our purpose is to live enough to try to make it to make it checke. Thank you very much.
Before all I will show you the most rapidly possible to be able to do the Microsoft in the Microsoft in followed to Microsoft in the follow. This is Seadragon.
It's a environment where you can interact is a local level, which remote with a huge amount of data visual data --
We're seeing a lot of gabytes of photo-gabyt-gabyt-fast bread, to be a quick slights, to be able to image as we want to him.
And it doesn't matter how great information of information that we see -- how big these data data or images.
Most of them are digital photographs, but this for example is a slide from Bilibrary from the Bilibrary of Congresss' gamm of 300 megapixel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of place in your screen in any time. It's also an architecture in any time. It's also an architecture of architecture flexel of it.
This is a book inter, example, of the data of images.
This is the She's Casa desolater of Dickens. Every cool represents a capitly.
And so that it's just text to tell you that it's text to do one thing like that, to make a realal representation of the text reality, not a picture.
It could be a little way to read a little bit of electric book a book.
You don't look at it.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian example of The Guardian example of The Guardian.
Every image is the beginning of a section.
And it will really give you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of a view or a newspaper or a newspaper or a quotidian of a matter like a lot of half a very thely.
We also did something with the number of this number of the Guardian angle of the Guardian angle of the Guardian angle of this number of of the Guardian.
We created a high ad, high-resolution -- much higher than what you use in a normal advertising -- and we put in the normal of the content -- and we put extra.
If you want to see the characteristics of this cartoons, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the techniques.
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of spaces on the screen of the screen on the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the scue of space.
We hope this means to put pop pop on and other side and other porkers, not to be necessarily to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time if you don't say that we have contributes to give it in this camp.
These are all the way in the U.S. obliged image of NASA.
So we now now now now we go to something else.
This is actually from the websquare actually on the web; you can see it to see.
It's a project called Photosynth, which combine two different technology.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research of the Washington, a student of the University of Washington, with the aid of Washington, with the Hee Steve Seitz of Microsoft Resch. She was Microsoft Resch. She is a collaboration.
And it's from the web, I managed by Seadragononon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen that we can go from one picture to the other and have this kind of experience to the other one of multiple.
But the collocation of the images here has actually actually actually an significant significant to
The computer visualization of the computer visualization of the computer has recording to these images together, so that the images -- all the neighborhood on the Montaguhs on the Montags of the Grashs on the MontagRoccies -- have been taken out of a slide-show show. And these things are are all college in the space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There's some of the more space.
I want to go directly to one of the original data from the original data from a previous prototynth that we did work for the first time you have done for the first time you have done the last last last time -- to show you what I think is really the key to the same technology, Photosynth. And it's not necessarily to look at the environment. And it's not necessarily to the web.
We had to worry about legal aspects and saying.
This is a reconstruction of the Notare Dune Dame is Flickr. Basta digitary of Notare Dame in Flickr. and you get images of these types in the shirt of the camp, and so on the other major view of the image that is discovering a picture that is discovered to this model.
So they are all pictures from Flickr and have been all colleged to the spacal level.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never think I would never think of it to work for Microsoft.
It's very free to receive this kind of accool here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of focused of focused from those photos to the professional SLR, a significant number of of of messing in this environment.
And if you can try to look at those strange strange.
Many are blocked by fact, etc.
Somewhere you have a series of photographs -- etcol.
This is a Notare Dame Dame recortly Dame recortly.
We can go from the place, in the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is taking from all of the game memory of how it appearing the land from all of those data together.
All of those pictures become line, more of the same.
You have a model of the land that emerge.
Think about this as a motion of Stephen Lawler on Earth of virtual Earth
It's something that is that grows in complexity as people using us. And the people that usual use.
Their pictures are marcked with other people.
If someone is the idea of contransforming all these sang on the name of Notre Dame suddenly Dame suddenly Damimvised and recognized the set, and I can use how point of engine, in that universe, in that we use the space, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, using the other kind of rection.
Of course, a consequence of all this is a consequence of all the interesting of every interesting part of the earth, and so on.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood OK? What your software will will be able to do is that at some point, in the next years, all the photographs of them shared in the world will will be practically colleged together?
BA: Yeah. What is doing is basically discover.
It's creating hyperlinks, if you want to be like --
And it's doing it based on the bottom of the imagery of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think of the recise of information that many of these images can experience that many of these images can hed?
As when you make a research of images on the web and the head of the web is about the web has a lot of information about the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the web on the web is a lot of information about the web is a lot of information about the web is a lot of information about the web is about the pictures of information of information about the web is about the web of information of information of information of information of information of information of information of information of information of information of information of information of the web, and
Now, what happens if that picture is the picture of your pictures are that?
So the amount of interconnection, and the amount of reck and the amount of retable. It's a classic effect of the network.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible. See liments.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the main when you travel and one of the research of the research is the power to live between who has no anti-traditions, between who has no anti-tradition-driving and the finger-to-driving plant in the wind of the plants.
You know, further the sciamans Jaguars are still beyond the Milky Way, or that the ancient of the ancient funny meant or that in Himalaya, budholding the respier of the anthropologist, to remember, and the idea that we live not exists in the sense of the anthropoloy that we don't exists in the absolute, but it's only a reality, but it's just a model reality,
the consequence of a particular choices that our stirps of adaptations that our stirps have done or myself generations ago.
And of course, we all sharing the essential trately.
We all come in.
We are subjected to the beginning of the initiation.
We have to deal the inexorse death, so we don't surprising us and balliam, and whales --
We all have a weak art.
What it is the particular of the song, the ritof the song of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Borneo, or the Borneo, or the Haiti, or the Worriers of the desert Kaise in Kaise Sahara.
He was my journey of journey in desert a month ago, or a month ago, or a yak in the valley in the world.
All of these populations teach us that there are other ways to think, other ways to think, other ways to think, other ways to think of other ways to moving in the world.
And if you can give you a second, it's a concept that can give you hope.
And so that we can have the reaches of the world create a ragnatela of life and cultural life and cultural to the planet and is important for the well-being of the planet so the ragnatezing of the planet so the raise of the planet as biosphering biophers.
And you can think of this rather cultural ragnatheless as an ethnose and you can define the ethnose the ethnose of all the conceptions, ideas, myths, ideas, myths, ideas, intuitions of intuitions from the half of consciousness of consciousa.
The ethnose ethnose is the amazing of human manity.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in as inquisite inthitive species.
And because the biosphere was free to the biosphere is happened to ethnose and purfortunately, much more quickly.
No biology, for example, it would say 50 percent of all the species was or the extinction of the extinction of the apocality, or -- in the most of the hypothesis -- in the most of the biological diversity -- and not near ar to be more optimic -- that of the cultural diversity.
The indication of all of that is the nongue language.
When you're born there were 6,000 language on this planet.
A language is not just by a vocabulary or from a series of rules.
One language is the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spiri.
It's the middle with which animation of every culture is in the material.
Every language is a forest of the ment, a thinking, a thinking, a thinking, a thinking, an ecosystem of spiritual system.
And those 6,000 languages when we are sitting here in Monterey, at least half the half is not suspected in the ears of children.
They don't be teached to children, which means, unless you know, unless not cambel, which are already to die.
What is more tristers of being fly out of the silence, to be the last tongue to talk a language of transmitting the wisdom of the children's basive to the promise of the children?
This is a fashion is somewhere in some part of the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks a folds and leads with sweeks and with sweekls of a anguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguy.
And I know that someone will tell "Isn't it better than that?
The world would not be a better place if we all talk the same langu?" Bensynthis?" Bensynthish -- we talk to clear.
We talk to kogist.
You will find out a track what it means you can't talk to your language language.
I would like to do you have a journey through the ethnose --
a little journey in ethnose to give you a little journey of what we're loging.
Many of us forget that when I say "different different ways of existing existing really different ways of existing existing ways of existing existing in the ways.
We take for example, this bimbo Barasaasa, in Amazon the sken of the anaconda, which creates to the midle of providing of the best skest in the skest skets of the skest sacris.
It's a popular population that it's not able to distinguisn't in the blue of the green because the hundred is identified in the time of the forest, which is the popular popular of the popular popular color.
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule, "Elinguisticy," you know, you have a person that speak of a different language.
And all of this has radicated in the past, the young of the hundred is that in these families are talking about six or seven language because of the mystics of mystics are a linguish of a linguish of a linguish of a language that are side of the mysts of the mystics that are six or seven of the mystitology matrimons that are because of the mysticks of a langu
They listening to listen to and then start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived in the Waorans of Ecuador Ecuador who had the first contact of the first contact in 1958.
In 1957 mission of misionary mission has tried a commitment contact of a fact that
They made up from the top of photographs that were retending them in a few of the place that this population of the plug of the plug of the plug of the plug of the plug forest of the rainforest of the ran forest of the raising forest to the size.
They made the photographs from the ground, they have been researching of a shape or a figura -- they have concluding that was the dirty of the dirty with the five missionaries of the mission with the lands.
But the Waorans didn't kill the strangers.
They killed in them.
The 50 percent of mortality was caused by them of themselves.
We are risalitites at eight generations and we found two of natural death cases and when we insisted for knowledged that one of them was so that they died to be aging that was so they killed it was that him. And then they killed it was a knowledge of the forest forest him.
The hunters were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the first 1980s, I was assigned a very interesting tremendous tape when my Harvard professor to go to Harvard to intruilate between the secret of the power of Duvalier and Tonton and Mr. and Tonton Macoutes, and impossessary-like cho-the-wild-cleft to do zombies.
To give a sense of miracle I would have to understand the Vodouble, and that the Vodoun culture is not nera.
It's just a complete metaphysics of a complex metaphysics.
Very interesting.
If you ask to tell me the great religions, what would would say,
Cristianesim, Islam, Buddismo, Buddhism, etc.
A continent is always left out of the sub-Saharan Africa, thinking that sub-Saharan Africa, and the Voodoo doo is not that the distilled of these religious conceptions of non-See religious that are religious to the tragics of the slavery of the slavery of the slavery of the slavery of the slavery of the slavery is not that religious religious sls.
What makes you interesting your voodor is the intense of life and death.
So you can live the spirits of the spirits.
You can be invocked by the Great Aqua, they answer the dance of the dance and they replace to the dance of the dance and they replace to the view the house of the follow.
And so you can tell you about God.

In a blood level, this popular continent has never been conquered by the spagnos.
And yet today I have governed from a classic cline, but their formation is really amazing it.
The young people have taken from the families to three or four years and they live in a world made of good and shadow in a world of good and basis in the glaciers for 18 years.
Two nine years of choices to produce the nine months of the gestation of the gestation of the mother, now are metaphorically in the utery of Great Mad.

And I think of my testhesis you can't classified these triptams like hallucinogens because if you're not going to tell anybody of being abucked up.
It's possible to assummers just if they asked other chemicals that moneys who are money.
Now it's the beautiful beta-carbon that is in this lian of the MAO, of the same kind of necessary to the triamptam. The question of the sources of the sources of plants, like these are going to find two death, like these are going to find two deaths of these particular populations, but if you combined in this way, create a biochemical version of the particular factory that is remarkable to the beings?
We use the great euphemism of proof, and the error, which can be infrupting.
But if we ask Indians, they will tell us "The plants of talking about.

This tribe, the Cofan, has 17 variety of ayaxas, which are born in the forest, and that the eyes would come in the same species.
If you ask them how they are the stablishes to them, "I thought I was a plant, I understand plant, the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of plant, "I thought I was not all of the rest of the rest of plant, I said, "I think I don't know all of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of plant, I don't knowlandarmurgerg.
The solution is taking 17 variety in a night and each night in a night and each other.
And this is not degree to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to contain the skys.
Now, the problem is that also the problem is that the ones of us who have heart the popules of the indigens are butters of the history of the history of our real world.
In fact the 20th century, in 300 years, not going to remember, in fact that we were in the technological innovations that we were in the where we were stopped and we embrbrace and we habared active accepted the masses of the planet. Now the problem is not change. Now the problem is not change.
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new life.
And the problem is not technology.
The Sioux Indians don't stopped to be Sioux when they put them from a part of the Americans have no stopped to be Americans when they put them from a part of the horor.

The Revolution of Neolitical volution that has given us to the seeds of the seeds, to replace the poem with the slide of the cline, creating the gerarchia of the specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrialized world has 300 years.
That slide story doesn't suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to address to come to the millennia.
When these myridge of cultures of the world is asking what you want to be human to be human with 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all answer the chance of being what we are doing, a consciousness of being what we have to do is that all the popules and all the gardens can true. And there are great moments of optimism.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope to call other than you heard and proverting to the other collegments, in the case doesn't have the notaste.
I want to start with what I call "the offical."
The offical dogm of what?
The dogma dog, the officer industrial societies "The recity of the west, "If we want to massive the well-being of our citizen citiza's freedom."
The reason that is from a side of the liberty is in the same a value, is preciout, essential for human beings.
On the other is that if we are liber, each of us can act to do everything massive to do anything that massive our well-being, without any one that decide in our name of our own own nobody.
The way to massive liberty is to massive liberty is to male choice.
More choices people hanno, the more is free, and greater is their freedom, and greater is their being.
This is so deeply, it's so deeply radicated in society that nobody would be able to put it in the two-fashion.
And it's also deeply radicated in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible possible to be able to show you a few examples of what progress.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly large.
I put it on a simple named on the indows for injery.
In my supermarket there are 175 conments, without contact the 10 variety of oils oilive oils and 12 acets of oils that you can buy to do a huge number of conditions, and the 12 acets in the circumstances in the circumstances in your circumstances is your degree of your degree.

And then you go to the electronic snegotic negotiat, the CD, please, plasteronishing --
And in this single negotial of electronic electronic snegotic of electrons.
We can make six million different different combination of different combinations using the components that there are in a negotie.
You have to admit that there's a lot of choice.
Other camp: the world of communications.
Occlear, when I was a child, you could get all the service telephones that were wish, pack-bag telephones were mamma Bell.
He read the phone; you didn't buy it out.
A consequence of that, in the other one was that the telephone doesn't break out.
These days.
We have a variety of telephones almost lies between cells.
Here's the future.
My favorite is the middle of the MP3, cut, and form in the holding of the hidden for the crash myself bule.
If you have no you seen in the horse store in the horse of the horse of it will be pretty much to preon it.
And what happens is that people come into the snegozos and it ask this question. And you know what the answer?
It's not possible to buy a cellphone; it's not too many things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the same explosion of choice.
Assistance of health sanitari: not the more in the United States and the doctor of what you have to do.
And he said, "Well, you go to doctor, and the doctor saying, "Well, we might do A, we could do A, or B" and these risks." What do you want to do?"
You say, "Dr, what should I do?"
And the doctor says, "All these are the benefit and these answers and these risk."
"What do you want to do?"
And you rebat?"
And the doctor: "But I am I not here."
The result of the result of the malato," expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not that one of the weight and responsibility of taking decisions someone who knows about someone else that it doesn't know -- and almost certainly is not -- and so it's not sick -- and so not in the ideal conditional conditional decisions the patient to make the patient decisions that is the doctor, and so it doesn't have the ideal conditional decisions that doesn't know --
There's a big marketing products drugs of drugs, direct people like me and you, whether you think it has no sense of it, that if you think has no sense that we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy them, why are you going to advertis?
The answer is that they want dom, we call the doctor to change the recipe of changing the recipe of change.
And so fundamental of how our identity is a question of choice, as you see in this view in this view of the inner and "We don't want to force, we will be able to get their sex sex their sex sex to the right now, we have to invent the right now.
And we can reinvention us how many times we again how many times we again it.
The means that every morning, to the answer -- you have to decide that kind of person wants to be there.
And he respect to the family and matrimon, a common perspective of the perspective of it, it was that you could be the predictable, and he started the pretty possible.
The only one one real choice was with choice -- not here, and even what to do later.
Or day, everything is really to play.
I teach them very smart students and I think about 20 percent of work at less than a time.
And because they are less brilliant not because they are less diligents.
but why are they impensiers, I intentents to ask you, I said, "I should do it now?"
"Do I have to get to yourself late? I think before I kids or career?"
They're interrogatives of loglant.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implement doesn't completely get the compitites and not to get a drink your exam.
And they really have to ask it. They're important.
Now, the work: we are lucky, like Carl arl technology is because technology allows us to work every day, every day, from every day, from every day, from every day, from the planet, trane from Hotel Randolph.
Timetet, there's a corner, and I'll tell anybody whom the WiFi works.
I don't say that I want to use it.
What does that mean, this incredible liberty liberty that we have to work on the work? What is we have to decide, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our broad hot and play hot in a tas, the Blackberry in the other, and the nice none; and the nice none;
And even though they're all screen every minutes that we see our boy to roll the game parent, we also ask them, "I have to answer this called the a?"
"I have to answer this email? I have to ableth?"
And even when the answer is "us," all this makes the experience of your best boy from what it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part we look at it, small things and big things, and big objects and big objects and life is a question of choice.
Once the world was this: Ove, there were some choice, but it was a question of choice.
The world today is like this: The dilemma is, "Is it is a positive thing to the negative or negative negative no?"
The answer is Shim.
The positive side of the positive sides of the negative negative people.
This is all the choice two negative effects on the people.
The first one, heavy is that produces instead of free paralysis instead of freedom.
And so many options of the options of the choice, it becomes very hard to do it.
I want to give you an example of the result of the plans of thinking about plans.
A my college has access to the data of Vancers, the gant of the source of thought, with about a million clients of folded in 2,000 different companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered to be offered in the moral less of adescenes 22 percent of the 22 percent of the experience.
With 50 sources there is 10 percent of less than the 10th of until less than 5. Why?
Because with 50 foundation of the founds, it's maledetail, and choice is remained to the indemate to the inquestion of the questions.
And the question is, and still asks, and of course, questions, and of course questions, and of course won't made.
You know, that doesn't just mean that these workers will be able to food for cancers because they don't have enough money, it also means that the decision is so ostics that are so ostics that they lose the foundations of work.
They don't participand they're losing to 50,000 dollars for the data from work, which would be become to versus to the them.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choice.
And I think it makes the world like that.
"And finally, for the ethnesis: ketchup, or maione?"
You would just take the right decision is that if it's for ethness, right?
You don't want to choose the bad of the wrong and the wrong condition
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we could avoid the paralysis and make a choice, we are less to be satisfacts of how we were going to be with less options that we were with less to the fer of the choice.
And this for several reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions, which is that you would choose and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you would have been better to be better choice. And what happens is that the alternative imagined us in the alternative imagined in the choice, and the rescue of choice, and the recognize the sodden sodden the recorded of the choice, and the fashion decision of the press,
even when it was a very good decision.
More choices us are easy to be holding any details that it's insodsatisfied to choice.
And yet, there's what economists are called cost-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asks, like the value of the value of the value things that we are dependent to depend on what we confrontive to it.
And the rest of the options of it, it's easy to represent the alternative characteristics of alternative scared and being less less to be satisfied of the option.
Here's an example. I sware with all of the New York Cit."
But it's what you probably think you probably thinking.
There's this couum to Hamptons.
A place of lum.
It falls beautiful sket. It's all about them.
Nothing to do is nothing. But what he thinks is "Well, males" is Augosto."
"Everybody all my neighbors in Manhattan are vie."
"I could talk to the front of home."
And it turns to the idea that it's losing -- every day, which is losing -- every day, the chance of parking where it wants to get to the point where it wants.
The expensive opportunity decrease the soddisftion for what we have, even when the choice was excellent.
And the more are the options we have to consider the more characteristics will come back to how expensive expensive expensive to the way against how expensive expensive to the rest of the characteristics that we have to be able to return us out to be the way against how expensive expensive to the rest of the opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
And we talk about the live moment, and maybe the live slow.
But the most important point is that anything you choice, you choices you choice don't do the other.
The things that we don't choose, have a lot of factive that can make less attement to what we do.
Ter: The point: growing up of the expectations.
I tried to my skin my skin buy a new jeans.
I have almost jeans.
Once the jeans were just a type, buy and cloth, they were best, only after they best, only after they best, they were just brought to a life and a lot of times, they began to go well.
So, I went to buy a couple of new when the old ones were going, and I said, "I need to me a couple of jeans, this is my cute."
The brought me to me, "Li wants slim fit, relaxed phite?"
Well it in the cirnies or with the bottons? "Stonebelts." "The Stone" or ""Cles?
"Would you like the road you do?"
"Sottype or stretty? Bla bla -- the blade." It was elenses to elense
I was supposed to say, and after a little bit I could say, "I want the only guy -- that was the only typoth." It wasn't a only one idea that I was a little bit of a jeans, and then I tried to all the diseases of jeans, and then I was the best I was the best jeans that I had ever happened.
It was the mas. And the whole thing I had the best best.
But I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worse for the worst of my aspects, my aspectations were very high yield -- the jeans had to be perfects.
I had expectations. I didn't expect anything that I was just a type of exception, when you see 100 different kind of things, at least a guy had to be perfect.
What I had water was good -- but not perfect.
After I was going to talk about the choice with what I was trying to meet in confront of the waiting.
The add of options in life of people don't get the expectations that these have spect to expect excellence.
And this will produce less sodden unfairly when the results are good people.
None in the world of marketing in the world of marketing
Because if you know that I would know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
"You was better when it was wors." The reason it was better when it was wors." The reason was that when it was worsse.
Or day, in the world we live -- opulently opulently to the city of perfection -- the massive that we can hope is that we can hope is that things are like to at the height.
You never have before you have never pretty surprising because your expectations, my expectative, you have injuries.
The secret of happiness -- what's here -- is he said, "Yes, "Yes, "Yes, I want."
I mean, small moment self-authobiographic moment, and my wife is really amazing to my wife is really amazing.
I wouldn't do better, I don't have any open.
But you know it's not always a brad thing.
And finally, a consequence of buy jeans comfortable jeans when you are only the jeans is that when you don't satisfact, and you wonderful "Why?"
"Who is responsible?" "What's clear?
The world is responsible. What could I do we do?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insumption, and you ask you who is responsible to you who is responsible that you are there.
You might have to do better.
With hundreds of variety of variety of the insuccessful insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even if the result is valid, they feel insatisfied and they make the colpe and they give them the same.
In the last few depression is exploded in the industrialized world in the industrialized world.
I think a significant factor -- not the unique, but important -- of this depression is that people have experiences of depression is that people have experiences because the standards, are too high deludns are too high.
And when they have to explain this situation thinking that the colpe is them.
So the final result is that we are better, objectively, but we feel worse.
Let me remind you you this:
This is the office, what we all take for the good and it's completely fail.
There's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I haven't really going to be a lot better choice is better than a little bit of a little bit.
There's a critical value, I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have superced by a piece of the level where the improvement of our life.
Now, from the political point of view -- I almost finished the point of view, the crowing is the follow.
What it allows you to all this choice in industrial society is the material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about it, and you know how much the problem is not that have too much choice.
The problem is that they have too pocades.
So the fact that I'm talking about is a malesclusive to modern from Westerns,
And what makes and arrableing is this: Steve Levitt talked about iers and how you expensive the hoseat and seat and seat sat and basic seat and basic spread.
I mean, these choices, complicated and dispendepending, it's not that they just useful to be inuseful.
They're the deleters.
They make it worse.
If a little bit of what in our societies allows us to be reversed in those where people have too poor people have too much choice was going to be better for their life improvement but also the now.
This is what economists are call a better paretian.
A red-red-red-red-red-a-red-do--- not just to poor poor people in this except that it comes back to us.
And to concluding it to the "You can become all you want, "
You know, people of culture, you think, "What do is the weight?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a mouse of the veter."
"As an imagination, a constant, a limited viewer."
and I anked it to the point to the beginning.
But then, I think, I realized that that fish the fish, I realized that that fish is a long time.
Because the reality of the facts is that if you manage in frankly, and you don't get the freedomous, you don't get the freedom. You get the paralysis.
If you break the mouse of the way that all become possible to decreate the sodden deft.
You hear the parals, and you reduce the well.
They all need a sphere.
This is almost certainly too strected, maybe even for us.
But the abce of some symbolic symbolic symbolic and temple, for the roll of the roll of the roll of the road.
Thank you very much.
