And the year I showed these slides to show that the calculations that the calculates of the size of the 48 million years has had the sizes of 48 States of 48 percent.
This is the gravity of the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show it to the same.
The calculate glacial climb is in a sense, the climate climate the climate climate system.
You can expands and wind and wind and wind the wind of the winds.
The next next device, it will be a rapid rapid the rest of the last 25 years.
The gyacross the enough are draw in red red red red it.
And you see it turns out to the blue blue well as you see the blue well as you see the blue blue well as you see the blue blue to the blue blue wrong to the blue blue well.
That's the ice in invert, which is the winver, which is the windner to the winds.
You can see that the cosid-hype of five years or five years or more, five years or more, which is like the sandwell.
In 25 years is spent from this, I was going to go to this.
This is a problem because the wind interested in the early beard to the ocean to the ocean to the ocean to the realm of carbon congeled that we want to get to put them into the metaphands of the microbs.
Rished to the totality of the atmospference of global warming to global crazy would be a spot of not right.
In some of the bottom of the bottom in Alaska he's rebolling water.
The professor, Katey Walter of the University of Alaska team is rected with a theam that we rected the scorin.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: Loo's question. The questions is if we will be now.
A motive, this environment is that this environment to the Greenland the Greenland from the north of the north.
This is a glacial record.
And he had never reached it had never reached similevels.
This is the Kangerlusual Kangerlusual Greensough of the Greenland

The environmental disaster is increasing out of the normal and without precedent.
Four volved more numbers in the last 30 years respect to the previous previous fly ly in the last 30 years.
This is a wrong of instenible instenought.
If you look at the context of the story if you can see the consequence.
In the last five years we add 70 million tons of CO2 hours every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day.
Look at the area of oriently the area of orient, done to the America, drive to the west, where there is a very poverimpovery-radical of the other side of the oxygene of the oceans.
Most of global warming global deforestation, which is the 20th percent, which is 20th 20, is the usually use to combinable to them.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is perhaps lost of the worst of the worst of it.
The United States are one of the most emissions, together, together, together.
And it turns out of building a lot of other central carbon on the carbon on the bon.
But we're assisting to a direction.
These are the projects of annothing in the last years, and some propositions.
Actually, there's a lot of politics in our Paese.
The carbon and the oil industry have been exploiting 250 million dollars in the last year to promove the carbon the carbon dio.
This picture I remembers to something,
Nath Nat, in Tenness, where you live a person of 3.8 billion history of charge charge of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of the side of the midddle of the six.
Maybe you saw it sounds to you.
This is the second biggest fle-scores in America.
It's happened in Natal.
The published natalia of the carbon of the carbon was this thing.
Man: Frosty ♫ ♫ Frosty is a kind of a balle, and happy and happy and happy and happy to it.
It's a lot of here in America, and it makes our economy.
Froy the carbon is always more freedom is always more freedom.
It's a good burnable and the workers and the workers are keep the style and the style stick and the workers are going to be the recip.
Al Gore: Does here is a part of the West Virginia.
The biggest society about the world's ministrator, it's Massey Coal. This is his friend.
Video: Don Blankenship: Sarchiaro -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelolos, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clim of Clim and Scipation of the Clim has to walk two non-non-walks.
This is a begin, a lot of the ske.
Video: Acras: Actually, we see the climate changes like a minid of the climate to our business.
And this is our priority is invest a great amount of money in a public heappears to make the truth, and confuses the truth.
In fact, the carbon is not spor.
We think it's a good -- it has a good profum.
So not precupated of climate changing climate change.
Let me do now.
Video: Aclean: Carbon -- you have to heard a lot of it.
So we do a girl in a structure of the framework to how it is about the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon to the carbon the carbon to the carbon the carbon the carbon the fold.
Some of the machines are a little broken dead, but this is the sound of the carbon technology of carbon the technology of carbon the technology of carbon technology of carbon technology of carbon the technology of carbon technology
The consumer of carbon is between the main the main the main of global carbon the technology of the carbon the carbon that you can see change.
You have a eye of the game technology of carbon technology of carbon the carbon digite.
Al Gore: Infinally, the slide is the positive connect to the economic issue and the national.
Video: Man: The America, is in crisi; the economy, the surecrisis, the crisis.
The film that college all of the team of the combons were combinable to the carbon and the oil and oil and oil and oil and oil the important.
Now, there's a new solution to usual solution to use to us.
America, 100-power energy to the energy energy, in diease.
They like to do the America, to work in the work, more sure you can help us to remove the global scale of global warming.
Finally, a solution that you have to solve our problems.
America. Scover America. Scover of it.
Al Gore: This is the ultim.
Video: You know, I think about to redate energy to America.
One of the faster of the faster of the dependence from the combinable to the didence of the biggest dependence on our planet.
I says, "The future is here. I sole, solid new energy.
She was 2: Novi investment to the well of the well-well-well-well.
Man: Reasy of being realists.
Al Gore: A old old old you you you says, "If you want to go to the sun, you go to the sun.
If you want to go to go away, you go together."
We have to go to away, quickly fast.
Thank you very much.
The year to TED fect a introduction on the LHC.
And I promise to go to add to add you to work the machine.
So I realize it down, the other time there is no scientific experiment -- 27 kilometers or ever a little bit of conference.
Her compiece is to recovering the conditions that were less than a billion second of a second to 600 million times to 600 million times a second.
All is simply simply environment.
This is the Gineva.
We have these mini-Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Big Big Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Bang Big Big Big Big Bang Big Big Big Big Big Bang Bang Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Banger.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is a 44 feet and has a diameter diameter of 2-metris.
This is a picture of ATLAS in ATLAS in building so you can notice the proportion of the proportion of the proportion of the ATLAS in the proportion of ATLAS in the production.
The 10 settember 10 year, we have accesor the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immense festimmensed in the control.
It's a picture of the first phascial particles that had everything that he did all the girling in collision, deliberately with a side of the LHC, and difficult particles.
In other words, when we see that image the picture 10 settember, we realize that the machine works, which is a great liftoria.
I don't know if it was to do it is to do more opening to the Google and vidence it was going to be this to Google was this thing.
What means we had a cultural impact of scientific impact to what scientific scientific impact.
About a week of later, there was a problem with the machine, I had to have to these files here -- these files -- these files -- these files -- these files -- these files -- these files --
These foot 13,000 ample of the bad of the massive powerful machine of power.
Now, technical technics between you look at the files and say, "It's not true.
And instead can do it because they are very freedoms become the surcondent of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of become to the surface of the surface of become up with the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surfaces.
So, at less 271 degradi, to a temperature of the space, these files can bring that corrup.
In one of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the LHC, there was a fable.
So the files are surprising to read read and 13,000 ample ample of the improvisly meet a electric.
This was the resulted.
Now, this is more impressioning if you think that these magnets fish fish the fish of 20 to the sken of about 30 centimeters.
These are damage about 50 magnets.
We had to take you to want to do it.
We repristined and add justed.
They're now now now are all the way to the ground.
I was going to be the left of the LHC will be to new integrate integrate again.
We're going to get to expect the data of the data to the data or him, and you keep it to find out what our wind to find the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain the way, these drive pattern, these drive on the value of science and eeria and eeria and efy to confiddent to confuture.
I think the fact that it's so difficult to go to the byle of the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the words of scientist, Humphrey Davy, Humph, which is a fen't experiments of the inus, and his fen't be a little pill, his fen't be Michael Farael Faray, said, "No is so dangerous to the progress of human minds of human mind of the human minds. They are in nature of the world's science of the grounds, which is that we are going to be able to be completely new of the square of the square of the square of our tripurpoctingingered to be in the square of our own own own own own own own own own own own own ons of the square of our minuttermous mindledededededededles."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about how to go to the kids, you know, kids, you play the battle with the battle buts.
And as you realize them as well and I realized them and realized them and realive, learn to think and solve problems and solve problems and eating the relationships and relationships and relationships.
The reason is propertive space, it turns out of the world around us.
So, by informatics of our interaction with the electures, and I was a physics, and my consulting and my collaborator Jeevan Kalthanith, I started to ask to ask with a computer, I started to ask with the bad of the care of the mouse of the path of the bad of a hands that are a hand-hand-hand-de-house with a hand-hand-hand-fly a souse with a sandlandscape of the drying with a computational information with the information of the information of the information of information with the information with a ction,
and we start our pleasing pleasing our pleasing plat?
And the question was so interesting that I decided to exploring the answers, building Siftable.
In fact, a Siftable computer is a whole computer interactive as a big birth of a birth of a birth of a birth of a bikdds.
In fact, a Siftable computer is a whole computer interactive as a big birth of a birth of a birth of a birth of a bikdds.
You can move with the hand, they can see with them, "You feel the right movement and have a skerging wireless.
But now, it's objects are objects like the mattones, you can move simply to be able to reols.
The Siftable example of a new ecool of a new ecoating information.
And as they become more physics, consciouss, consciouss, and the mostly motion, and the mand they get more physics, consciouss, consciouss, like the motion, of how we can move new stily to the new stily new different stily and different type of interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show the video -- if you including the video it will be in a direction, if you including the other side of the other side of the back.
These are interactive in the other other of the others.
If they are going to be able to what they mean they intor.
If they go to the food, and they can agitate a little bit of it.
If they go to the food, and they can agitate a little bit of it.
They also also also their movement, and including movement.
And then we realize that one of the interesting of the interaction was the power power to use the data, a clear example, "versation are" like it was a liquires like it was a liquired.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as sects, and I can use them to the color, where you can use them in the central central to the color.
and I can use them to be able to clear them in the central central central of the color.
If we can do too much of it, we can put a little place.
These are also beautiful chance to learn how the language, the mathematics where people can try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to make things quickly, and seeing the results of the results.
I'm -- I'm -- I'm --
This is a Fibonaction of Fibonaction that I do with a program of equations.
And we have a game of words that is metal-half between Scarabeum and Boggle.
Pratically, every turn to every turn out to every Siftable, Pratically, Praticically, to every turn to every turn to every side every turns out of every Siftable, and as you can go to a dition.
And then after about 30 second remiles and you have a new set of the side of the sket, and new possible to try to get to to try to get to to try to be able to try to get to to be able to go to to to it.
Thank you.
And this is here in the children came to the Middle Lab, I did it a video.
They are pleasures of it.
And one of the interesting things of this gence is that you don't have to give you a lot of education.
I just say to the word of words, and they will hear to exactly what to do.
And this is what they tried to do it down.
This is our header head, there is the most of young head.
It actually wanted to be implant.
They just brought the five to him.
Now, this is a purpose of a interactive cards.
We wanted to build a tool of the English language of the English is Felix.
And he can inserve new person, you have to get the Siftable to get Siftable to their associated ates.
And he can inserve new person, you have to get the Siftable to get Siftable to their associated ates.
And it's doing it using the sun.
Video: The sole is surprising and it's surgence.
David Merrill: Or it taken a treat the scen.
Video: The treat the ancient them.
Bel work! Si!
So I can get the Siftable and you put the neighbors can interact the person,
Video: Bau!
-- and to inventing their story.
Video: Ca!
DM: It's a story with enough and it can decide how you see.
DM: It's a story with enough and it can decide how you see.
Video: Vole, you know, I live it down.
DM: The last example I showed you is a tool, I recently recently, to five and example, to exeguing and exeguess music.
is a tool, realized tool, to field and exeguing music.
The Sefly here is based by the bottom of the basic and the bacteria.
Every one of these four different variation, and you can choose what you use to use to use to use to use to use to use it.
And then you can incool these sounds in a comport of comport to the food pleasures to the food of the food.
And it just to make it simply a sound "sounds and a "sequence."
These are effects that you can control from the view and the film.
And what you get to a particular sounds to add it.
And then there are the general effects like time and the um, which is apply to intersequence.
Look at how it work.
Video: DM: We'll start to start in two Siftable Siftable Siftable sequence, the system in a serious series, we add to the other base.
Now a bassroom.
Video: DM: Or unger of the side of the side --
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the effect of the live to the live to the live to the fact of the live to the bacteria, so I can put the bacteria, so I can put the bacteria, so I can put the bacteria, so I can
Video: DM: I know to fast the intersequencing the whole sequence, in the side of the side or from the side of the south of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the squence.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the filter to give the most expression.
DM: DM: I can can recombinate the sequence.
So I don't have to planning the first of the primal to make it more longer or more longer or more crash.
And now, finally, I can can sequence the whole sequence, inclining to the left the left Siftable to the left the Sift-flight to "
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is build new man-machines and more more more like our brains works, how our brains works.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this results that we can bring out of the lab.
The conct I want to get this new generation of objects to the new generation of objects to interacting with the media digital media digital decade in our world that we want to do.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the hour to talk to everybody with you.
These are a screen.
Scrisis is my profession, but it's more than that, obviously of course.
It's also the love and the fashcine my life.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But I said, something that is going to be successful happened in my life and in my life and in my career and I realized to realibring the whole thing with this work.
And the particular thing I recently recently this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prula, Prula, Prula, and a cedenters, to some cedention, for some custion, and it became a great sensational.
And the result is that everywhere you were to come up to the people who are treatment as if they were condent it.
Davail, condenced away.
They go to me all of me and says, "You don't have to be able to pay the more to be able to do me?
I don't have to keep somebody to keep all the life without more power to create a book that can make a book that can you make somebody to make somebody to be able to anyone to anything to you can get somebody to get somebody to be able to do anymore.
that can important someone to anyone else you can have somebody else to anybody el?"
It's rassicurant, you know.
But it could go to the worse I remembering me that I remember, when I was a adolescent -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a write.
I meet it against the same based by the country.
And people says, "I don't have to have success?
Do you have to paury billion of the refied billion kill?
You have to do this mestishing to do this mestian to come out out out of the horized to a horizing to a clear heart with the caving cenergy to lots of the care of the cenergy of flight?
So, you know.
The answer -- the short is all these questions is: "Si."
I think I was country.
I always had the country.
And I also have a lot of other things that people could not have to mean to it.
As and other things often and other things often it.
But it is how to write it looks at what I thought I was asked me to be ultimely because it is?
Is it it it is.
And it's logical that anyone debate to expect that you have to be slowed to do.
But what is so particular to make it creative to make it to make it to realive to the mind of the reality to the mind not fan?
How my father, for example, he was a engineer and I don't rememberistry and I don't get to the suntil the activity that was asked to be able to be able to be engineer to be able to be able to be able to engineer to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get to the engineer to be able to be able to be able to get to be able
It was never -- that block of the engineer John, how you well you well as well as well as well as well as well.
It didn't work?
Onestly, the engineers like group like group, they don't have certainly, in the several selizen to be alcolized to be treatment of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of being able to the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of course, in the several sectly secketing the reputation of the reputation of course,
We have enough this reputation, and we have this reputation, and not just writers but creative to be enormously enormously instable to be enormously instable to instable to instable.
And it's not rest to look at the tristand of the death of the died creative creative creative that only in the wind of the ground and often to the young and often to them.
And the people who don't have to be really, they seemed to be really, they saw their woms.
Norman Mailer, the first of the orim, in the last interview of my book to me a little bit of a little broken a little broad, and remarkable to the work of the work of the work of the work of their lives.
But we don't have the best when we heard these things that we heard these things that we completely completely interiorized and accepted the notion and the creativity and soffer and the creativity and the art of the art and the art of the art and it will always be a scia.
And the question I want to ask all of today is that is going to be able to the ide?
It goes on this -- because you can look at the basic centimeter of distance to me nothing to nothing to nothing this supposed to anything this --
I think it's good.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see the next several secolor in the next several century.
I think it's better to be better incord our great minds creative creative creative creative to vivere.
And I safe that in my home -- in my home -- it would be very dangle to be very dangle to the rest of supposed to be able to realize the circumstances in the careers.
Obbasic -- involved -- I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade of working in me.
And it's very likely what I will writing it will be going to be going to be the judicated by the world as the work that I often it was going to be happened to my book.
I'm going to ske, because we are all more friends here -- it's probably the most success is to the move to the middle and the sweep.
Oh, Ges: Oh, you think of her!
You know this is the gence of thinking that you bring a person to start to begin to begin to the nine and I don't want to do it.
I would keep it to do this work that we love this work that we lot.
So, the question become to become to commonish?
And so so that after a lot of refless, which the way to work to keep is to keep a psychological costructures, right?
I had to find a distance of safety found out of me, which I'm writing to the reaction of what I reaction is to reaction is going to get E, trying to get E, trying to get to the next year I started to look through the time to look through the time to look through the time to look through the time to look through the time to the most of the best societies and more sang and more sancient and the most sancient of the best ides and the most of the best ideas
how to help people creative to do people to do the inergence emotions.
And that research me to the ancient and Roma.
Seguity, because I went to certain and then it comes back.
In the ancient and Rome and Rome -- people don't seem to believe that creativity came to the creativity came to the many, OK?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit of the diving and sevened to a few surprising and several to be able to reach and several source, to reach and severe.
The gregreater of the spirits of the creativity of creativity "demoni."
Socratic beautiful demon that I have a demon else to sweep.
The Romans were of the same idea, but they were called the kind of spirit without a genie.
The great is great diose, because the Romans didn't think that a genie was someone particularly smart.
They have to be a genie of the kind of divine that you believe that you believe in the walls of a little bit like elf, a little like elfe, a little like elf, and you come out to the work of the around, and you know, the work of the result of the result of the result of the result of the work.
Excycle -- this is the distance of what -- that costruct -- that costruct psychological that you can protect the results of your work.
And they all knew that was so that it working, right?
So the artists were protyped by certain the too example, like to example, right?
If your work was exceptional working was exceptional market, everything else to be helped by this incorpore."
If your work falities was not all of your falities -- right?
All of everyone who was your genius.
And so people have concept the creativity in Occdent to a very long time.
And then Rinascient Rinascient and change it and we can put this great idea, we put the human human being; we put the human beings and without the creatures and without the creatures and without the creatures that they writing from the divinity.
This was the rational of human eximent and people started thinking about the creativity came to think, that creativity came to the creativity came to the creativity came to thinking that creativity to come completely from the ration.
And for the first time in history, you get to this or that artist to this or that artist is like a genie with genie with genie.
And I have to tell you that it was a big error.
I think you love someone to be a simple person to believe as a recipe of being a recipe and the surprising and the founds, creativity and the ethern and the ethern of the ethern of the fragile and the efy of human fragile to the psystem to the psympty and the fragile of human beings that human.
It's like to ask someone of enginoid the sun.
Deform and destores of completely the ego and creates all these ingestible expectations on the performance.
And I think it's been this pression to aver the arsts in the past 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think it became to the question, and or?
We can do it different?
Magaary to a more antics of the world's relationships between human relationship.
Or notice --
Maybe we can't cancer, 500 years of though years of rational thinking about 18 minutes.
And probably people have the public public that solled to the non-scientific notion to the notion of the notion of the diged to the next further succeed to succeful succeful to succeful their projects.
I will probably not convinced you all about this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why you know?
Why don't I think it in this way?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that I ever heard to explain the process of creativity of creativity.
A process that whatever you have ever ever you have ever done to do something -- so fundamentally, everybody here -- you know, you don't get to rectionally.
And, in fact, it can seems completely paranormal seeming paranormal seeming to be completely paranorm.
I did this meet recently with the recently Ruth Ston, who now was 90 years, but that was a little bit of the life and I said that during his infected to the walking on his infected and said, I was working out in the field and I was working out in the field -- and I would have the walked out of the country.
I said it was like a fragorom of air.
And that was coming to the lei of the line of the line of the country.
I hear it goes to get the earth and he could make the earth under the tremendous suntil the building.
It was to have a solve thing to do to that point and it was did, to spot how a matta."
And so it goes to come home and it turns out of this poethesia, and it should be a piece of carry and a well bad and a wrong piece of paper and I faster to the page on the pay and I flock the pay on the pay on the pay of the page on the pay and I found it to the paper.
Other you could couldn't be able to be quickly enough and it goes to get to the recorree and it wouldn't get to the rocket and the walked through and well the rote and it would have to roll the ploy."
And then they were the volved -- this piece of -- and I will never tell you -- there were no perdent the moments that was almost losing to almost los?
So, he was cording to the house and he was trying to get through the walking and the poeth, and then he was going to go to the walking up with the other hand then he said, that it was like you and then said, that it was the other hand the off.
And he was poeded the poem and the realm and read in his body and read to the pay on the pay of the pay and the wine.
And in these foods, the exipage would be presented on the perfect and I meet it to the first to the first to the first word to the first word to the first slip to the first word to the first word to the first side of the perfect page and I intact it would be presented on the last page of the perfect and I meet it it would be presented on the last word to the first ske.
So when I think the thought, it's exactly exactly efy to my creativity to my creativity.
I don't have a creative -- I'm not a condent -- I'm not a condent condent to it.
I'm a muly, and my way to work is to work out of them is to set me to the same day, and go to the hours and go to the holdly and go to the windly furn us to go to the right hand.
But I guy in my head and I was scientist, I was scientist, I realized it to you.
And I image many of you have a han han fact.
You know, if the work and ideas and ideas I wouldn't extly be a certain the foundly to be able to extly huntil it.
And what is this thing?
And how we can relationship to do not to lose the head of the head, which you know, you do to reman?
And as I realized the best example, I have the musicians Tom Waits, which I interview that I interview for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the major the major the nation of the around, to try to control these species of check, to try to control, and you can creatives you these species of creatives to creatives ves you a whole whole person is interiorized.
But then I walk, and a day day and a day day while he was driver, and a day, and he was drive.
He was going to go and fast, and it all of this little framment of melodia, which is going to be in his head, elusive and the wind and you want to get to him, you know, it's wonderful, you know, it's wonderful, but you want to take them.
It has no piece of cards, not a matter, he didn't have a mathematic.
So I started to feel this kind of wells is growing in the him, "I'm going to be able to perder, and he remarry.
I'm not enough enough and I can't do it."
And instead of go to the panic panic panic stopping to the panic putting the panic put.
I'm going to go to the whole process and he did something completely new completely new completely new thing.
And he just says, "Scus, and he said, "Scus, I don't see that I'm dy?"
"To seems that can writing a canzone dog?
If you really want to get to the most opportunity when I can take me to you care of you.
Other you have to important someone else today.
I went to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process working on this one.
Not work, the work was still recognize as a seedle.
But the process, and fish the fish was that attempt to releave when the genie the genie that they come out of the problems and freedom to the back, and it turns out where they had no thing to be a whole thing to be a whole thing to be a whole thing to be a whole thing and they had to be a whole thing of the mind.
I know this work, wonderful as a wonderful conversation of the Tom and this conversation between Tom and this thing that I hopening and extremendous was Tom.
So as the story of the story that I was working on a little way I was working and I was working on a time.
This idea, I wrote I was writing "Mangia, Prula, Prula, and he die the cutting of the disperation that we were working on something and we were working on something and we would start thinking about something and I couldn't think that it will be the working on something and you will be the worse to be book.
Not just good good book, just book,
And I started thinking about this project.
But then I remembers to the aircrafy and try to get to the air.
So I gave my face and I written and I would say my bedan to a tangle top,
And I said, "You know, I mean, "You know, I mean, what this book is not going to be brilliant to be brilliant not be brilliant to be brilliant to myself to myself in my books, right?
Because as I see that I'm going to put it all to do anymore.
So if you want to get you to show you you and you to get your parts.
Okay, if you don't know what I know about anything.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would want to do that that I was recorded to me that I today I today I today I was -- in the end of the She's Okay, and the record in the deserts of the dances and the light of the dances and move to the live and the musics and move to the be.
And they were always magnific because the ballers, and they were fantastic.
But every tant, it was something happened to it, and one of these arsts became to realize it.
And I know what I know about it, because I know the view all of you have all the point, a performance performance like this.
It was as the time you stopping and the ballery walking through a house of the door a house of different from the sun, like the 1,000 sun, like the 1,000 night before, but everything you get to ineat.
And in suddenly not just as a human human being.
But you get to the dident and under the didled in the divinity.
And when this happen, I knew that I knew what I knew that they were called it with his name with his name with his name with his name me.
They were behind the hands and they started cant, "Ah.D, Dod Dod God."
That's God, you know.
And I was a nice -- when the Mororor, the Spage of the Spage of Spay this habites with their unitity, and he can change in the secool, "Ah" to "Oole, "Oole, you can feel in the fle-corries in the flock of the corride or in the flock or in the flock of the lock of the friend.
In Spay -- when a artist has made something impossible and magic -- "Ah, oh, opefully, bravoiific -- a book; a little score.
And it's great gotten because we need.
But the problem is the day for the baller's walling stand and you find the wall, and you find 11 of the Martedge, and I wouldn't be the Dod and you get it up.
It's just a death, with the origina, and maybe it will never be able to be able to be able to make that allower to that allower to the efy.
And maybe no one will be the name of Dod still as you go and so you need to do with the rest of his live?
It's difficult to it.
This is one of the most of the most dolorous d-living life.
But maybe not to be so angoing to be so done if you can do not believe that the most extraordinary to be coming from you to be come from you to yourself from you you saying.
But I just believe that they are data in prested by a inimagine that you have to be a squisite of your life that you have to go to someone else when you do anything else when you do it.
And, you know, if we think of this whole whole thing change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought of it for different months in the works, the working on the book that public book, the dangerous floced of my great deal with my big device.
And what I have to keep it to tell me when I feel electrack from this is, I wouldn't have path.
I don't have to be around. I don't have to work on.
He represents to represent it to the you, whatever can be it.
If your work is ball, ball, ball.
If you dive, you know, I mean an an assigned decide to leave some kind of wonderful to be a wonderful moment to a moment to the slights, then "Ole!"
Other than you do it in your dance.
And "Ole!" to you do it down.
I think and I think and I think you debrows.
"Ole!" to you know, I also have to love the human beings and head, and head, and you can make you keep keep it to you get to represent you to represent you to represent you get to represent it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
And as I know I talked about some of these projects on human genome of human genome of the genome of new set of genomes.
We're starting a new fashion the digitalizing biology and now to the biology and now to go to a new fashim of the biology, and providing a new fashigh, producing and seven living and seven living and seckyzing and sect a new fashion the biology of the biology, and then we started to digitalizing
We always tried to make great questions.
"What is the living is something that many biologists have to understand how to figure out to figure out the levels.
We tried to be different approach, I reduce the minimes.
We're digitalizing from almost 20 years ago.
When we sequenced the genome of the human genome of the biology of the biology of the biology of the computer.
Now we asked us to regenerate the living life, or to create new digital?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genome of um, which is the smaller from the genome of the genome that can autorefy in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more smaller to create a little bit more smaller than that.
We're able to eliminate a centina's gene of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the walking to his map metabolic maps to the now.
I think of them, this is simple it.
But when we look at all the genes that we can see a time, is very improbably improbably to bring a viventure cell.
So we decided that the only views to progression to progressive this cromodes to be able to make a little bit of the fundamental questions.
And so we started the wind of the "Post we can set a cromost?"
And he can make the chemistry of produce these great molecules that we never have to create before we have ever ever to create before we have to create before we have to create the big molecules that we haven't to make this big molecules of produce molecules that we can make before.
And, in case of them, we can make a cromostly cromost?
A cromosometime is simply a chemistry of the inertomor.
The speed with that we are able to degitalize the life is growing to exponential exponential exponential to exponential exponential degitalize the degitalize of the digitalize
Our capacity of writing the genetic code of the genetic code of it, but it's better hourselves --
And our more recently results the door ctors on a exponential curvent to the exponential curve.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has requires requires of the put, and we started the first experiments.
But we found that set to the DNA is very difficult to be very difficult.
There are decade of thousands of the world that produce of DNA, the world's bad of the DNA, of 30 to 50 lect leck and is a degenerative process is longer to us and it is longer to us and there are longer to us to get us to the world and it's a long long time to the world's best of the world's best of the worl
So we had to develop a new metol to assembling these framments and correctable to the errors.
And this was our first tentative in, particular information of the digital genome of Phi 174.
It's a little viruses that killed food.
We designed the framments, effects of the errors and you get a molecular of DNA molecule.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of material of the material and we insert in the bacterial batters begs began to read this genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic materials.
The particles are all the cell as you get to the cells, are coming back and have dropped the Ecools.
I recognize with members of oil industry was saying that they certainly comprecise this model.
They have realive.
We think this is a situation in which the software can actually build his hardwin a biological system in a biological system in a biological system in a biological system in the situation system that is a biological system that software can actually build the situation.
But we wanted to do things more in great things in great things in great it.
We wanted to build the whole cromosometimes of the bacteria.
These are more than 580 miles of code code of code of code in the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of code of code of code of code of the genetic.
So we thought of building it in the cassets of virus, so that we could change the cassets to understand what the cassets are components of a cell cells of a vivent.
The projecation is crucial crucial information in a computer, these are decade in a computer, these have to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate with digital information is crucial des.
When we sequence, we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accurateurate for every 10 miles to every 10 miles for every 10 mibasis.
We found it resequence, 30 errors. If we were used to use that sequency to make it work.
A part of the process is designing the long time to go to 50 leck that you slip to the other segments of 50 lects of 50 lects to build under to build under to make the little works.
We are element to only have a little bit of here.
You probably have you read the bodie of the great bodie.
Think of course we have a genetic genetic genetic code on four liter: A, C, and T.
Tree those lects together, and it was about 20 minamminious about 20 minamminious to the rest of the leck to every miniving to every minight.
So we can use the genetic code for writing part, fraise -- frather than that.
What we did we have been autography was autographers.
Some are states from the fact that was not exive.
We designed these segments for simply to simply them to be a huge with the entire of the same thing.
There are improving them and they put them out and put them out and put them out out there.
And we started to assembling the particular of the particular five to seven the leck of the six, the leck of 24 milddle to their until to their until to get to 72 mildd-to get to 72 miles the literally ly.
And every steps we produced these segments in the enough to make a little bit of power to create a procediment to create a resible-ft-screening to a minute.
We're trying to automatizing the process.
So, this seems to be the tabellon a basket.
When we go to these segments very long long as a long long time of 100 miles -- they will grow more directly in Ecools.
You get to the limate tools of the tools of the biology of molecular biology.
So we consider other monthy.
We knew about another mechanism called recombination called recombination that in biology, which in biology to repear DNA degree of the universe of the unique segments.
Here is a example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiodrinotic to three million radiation.
You can see in the requarter as his cromosometimes come to distruct.
In 12 hours -- 24 hours is the first time.
They were thousands of organisms that are in the organisms of organisms.
These organisms can set completely ely completely ely recover.
They can live under to be a very good new.
These are absolutely certain the space, and you set to find new environments of water to find new environments of water.
In the true, NASA showed that this aven.
This is a picture of the molecular image that we built these process, just using this process, and just using the liview with the segments of the segments of the segments of the molecule.
The evilive to the auomatically.
This picture was not scacked with a microscope electronic, but with a microscope of rular broscope --
It's a molecular molecular that we can see the little microscope with a microscope of the lawer.
These are pictures that they covered a period of about six seconds.
This is the published that we did a long time.
These are more than 58,000 letting code of genetic code of genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic.
It's a molecular of a structure that I was created by the man.
It has a lot of them in a lot of them in 300 million hons.
If we go through a career with a 10 without of the ness of the nice to be 42 pages to be going to be this code to be this code to be this code of it.
Now, how do we work? How can we activate it work?
Of course, we travel a girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when you use the bacteria.
It's just the simple cells of the euclear cells like our re: you can simply extremely hunserve and inserve the nucleo and you can be practically the process of clonation.
In the bacteria araaea is instead is instead is integrated in the cell phone of the cell as we can make a complex cromosometime of a cell cell as a cell cell phone and activate it.
We can do a cromosometimes a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a bycle cromosome.
The two different are different as men as men of the topis.
We add some gene gene some of the way we could decide what you can choice to this cromost.
And then science with the indeal with the indevices in the way to killer all the proteins.
And when we put in the cell is stuff, and you get to the graph, you get our graphics of the cromosometime is go to the cell phones is go to the cell phone.
And we started thinking we couldn't go to the test in the slightly to the more of the sweeper in the side of them.
This is one of the most extremendous adisms of evolution.
We found that very much of these species have add a second or a third or a third of the early new track of new tracks in a thousands of new track of new tracks.
So whatever I think about evolution as a gene gene of the biology is a lot of the biology.
They were the restrial rections called the restrial rection, is that they addictartice DNA.
The cromosometimes that was in the cell as well as it woul.
The cell phon--cromosometimes that we inserito-------ha.
It's expressed and recognized the other cromostly like material material like material materials. And we are writing with only cell cromost.
became blue of the genes that we insert.
And in a short left of the time all the carries of a species are going to be a species, and you turned out of the new species, and it turns out of the new software in the cell phone of the cell phone.
All the proteins are changed, members are changed, and when we go to the genetic code of equid exactly what you have to transfer you transfer it.
Now, this could seemy treat, but altering the software to the software to be able to change things in hand.
Now, I explained that here is not parts -- but I progress -- but I realized to three million years and a new evolution, and I said that we have to create a new version of the explosions of the realitial species in the new species of new species of new species of the game of the gital process.
Why do that?
I think it's enough obvious when we think about our necessity.
We're going to go to six billion and a million people to the next 40 billion in the next 40 years.
I am to give a example, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for took a country in 1946, in 1940 years, they will be quite quite quite four to be quated.
We're going to find food, and you find food, water and brought and brought and bad to six billion people.
It will be more to do it for us billion billion billion billion billion.
We use more than five billion carbon of carbon of carbon of bars.
What means a million barils of a million barbils to the day.
When we try to find biological process, or any kind of process to remove to remove to the boyside of the enormous physical fish and a physical fish and I try to find biologically,
In the most of the CO2 from the CO2 from these materials that finished by these materials that finished in the mosphere.
Al day, today, thank you to the scientific scientific databases with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that they are components to think that are components to design the future.
The electronics only a dozen dozen of components, and you think about how many different things are seven coming out.
Our boboard here are data from the reality and our imagination.
We have techniques, thank you to these metohyd-rapid of synthesization, to create what we call genomic genomic genomic combinatoria.
We're able to build a big robots that can produce a million crows to a million cromosts to the day.
Think of the 20 million genes of different genes of different genes of these 20 million genes to produce the processing to produce the drugs, new vaccines, we can change it, and create more biology thelects, and create biology of the year science.
And it's just a sele-sele-section sele-section.
We can chemistry to survival to survival of survive, production or of the vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of the vacception.
This is a few software of some software programmed on that we're working to be able to set us to make a computer.
Well, we don't know we need to be like this.
We know exactly coming out of their genetic code of it.
We're concentrate on the carbon of the art of the generation.
You also saw you who experiment you hear the floced was a windows.
We have carburant of second and generation that will use to be recovered enough to be a carburant carbon the buttor different kinds of butts.
But the only way the biology can have a great impact without a great impact of foot foot and limiting the foot of foot would be going to be able to reach CO2 in materials that we're working for the cell to design that can be working out this pursummmer that they could could be able to the first of the first of a devictims.
The light solar combined with CO2 is a metodoc, we found in the world, we found different metodi.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
She lives in the ocean of about 200 feet of ebolliance to the ebolliance of the water of water of water water.
It relies from CO2 using hydrogene molecular as a little bong.
We're trying to figure out if we can incanaling CO2, which can be transported to be transported to be transported to drive this process.
So that short we could be able to increase what the questions of the question of the basic is Now, week is Now, weether, we have the model, we have the whole industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry of oil industry is oil to the whole industry industry of the whole of the whole of the whole thing of the whole of the recycle industry is the entire of the whole whole of the whole of of the whole thing of the remout.
And if you can't do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it to this?
It would be a main of energy.
Inot, we're working for using the same metaphot to create vaccines of vaccines --
You saw this year with influence, we are always behind a year and a year and a year and you get the wind the wind the just.
I think that what you can change building vaccinable to change in ant.
And this is how the future could start seeming to seeming the evolution, the tree of evolution, and involution with the bacteria and infinally inflic, and infinally inally, and infinally involved the eucar bird eucar eucar with the eucar eucar birth of evolution, and the evolution,
We're going to be so from the best people.
Our discovered is to live to live to try to make it a long to try to make it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
First of you will see the most rapidly possible, some working able, some of the new technology that we bring to Microsoft in the Microsoft in the midle of a year ago.
It's a enormous environmental that you can interact with a local level with an enormous amount of data viside.
We're seeing a lot of the gabyte pictures with a kind of zoom with a kind of zoom and keep it to a quickly fly like we want to him.
And it doesn't matter how big information that we see that we see how much we die of these data or the data or the images.
Most is communicated photograph of digital digital is a scansion from the Bibrary of the Congres-old scancial of the Congres-bad of 300 megapixel.
Not a difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is a number of a system in any time.
This is a book of inter, example, example, or example.
This is Casa desolated of Dickens. Ogni colons a capitol.
And I showed you that it's just to head and not image, we can do a thing of the general representation of the representation of a representation of the head, not a food; not a phote.
It could be a little bunch for read a little book to read electronic.
Not to be considered it.
This is a more realistic. It's a more realistic.
Every picture is the beginning of a section.
And you will actually give you the beautiful and the beautiful re-read read the version of a view or a molecules or a molecules.
We also did something with the corner of this number of this number of the Guardian.
We created a published ade to other, much more solution -- much more more than that you use in a published in a published publish. And we had to insert the contain.
If you want to see the carries of this authomobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or perhaps the specific specific models,
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limites of space,
We hope that means to be able to put it in the pops and other port birth of sillion -- not to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications of technologies.
And I don't want to lose you to lose that we have contributes to give you to get to to the walking in this field.
These are all the roads in the U.S. SSA.
So now we go to something else else.
This is effectively from the webs; you can go to see.
It's a project called Photynth, which combine technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research in the computer very interesting to the University of the University of the University of the U.S. Selish Selish Microsoft and Rick Szelish Microsoft Relish Microsoft Resear.
And it's from the web, gestures from Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screpattern, where we can go to the other image of the sket.
But the collose of space, the pictures here has effectively a meaning meaning.
And the algorithms of visualization of the computer have recording to the recorrespond to the light tools that I image -- all the pictures -- all the neighborhoods. And the Montags -- have been taken Rocciped to the record of a lide-eyes of a lide-sh-showed them a slide-like spite sharing with the level of the space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
And there are some more space.
I want to go to the walking of the name of the name of Noah-- and this is a precedent protynth of Photynth of Photynth -- to show you what we did to do to show you what we did to do this technology is really the ask of technology -- to show you what we have to do this technology is actually to the environment. And it's not necessarily to the environment.
We had to worry about the legal and says and says I saw it.
This is a rebuilding in the catter of Notage Dame pictures of the Sef, Basta digitate Dame in Flickly. And you get images of the field of the field of the fields and says that you have to do this is discovering a picture that is discovering a picture that is discovered this model.
So I'm all the pictures and they were all college and they were all college in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple way to navigate in this simple way to navigate in this simple way to navigate in this simple way
You know, I would never think I would have to work to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratifiction to recognize this kind of accool here.
I think you can see that you think it's a lot of different kinds of different kinds of fots of these photos to those cellular cellular to the SLR, a number of meaning a number of meaning in this environment.
And if you can try to try to try to try to try to try to do the strange.
Many are blocks, excts, excts.
And in the part of here is a series of photographs -- execke.
This is a placer of Notage Deame Deame of course
We can go from the places of the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environmental -- and it's taking data from all the way to collective the Earth from the point of viside -- and college all of those data together.
All of those pictures become together, most of the particular of the particular of the particular picture.
You have a model of the Earth and emerge.
Think about this as the long of Stephen Lawler on the Earth of the Stephen Lawler on the virtual Earth
It's something that grows in complexity to be able to use the people to use it to the people who use it to the us.
Their pictures are married by other people.
If someone is the idea of constructing all these slows the name of the name of the cattement Departy Dame Devis; I can use to rechieve all of those data, and I can use to the point of the data, and I can use to make the crazy in the universe of the cross-to-s-mote cross the s-mote cross-modes from the cross-mote cross-s-s-mom of the susers.
Of course, a consequence of this is the virtual virtual models of the Earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the images and the sization and six, and million, and six, the memory of the collective cities and sive the memory of the test virtual virtual and side the collective virtual ces.
Thank you very much.
Worson: I realize what your software well? What your software to be a certain the next one of the next one of the next one of the photographs -- all the photographs are going to be able to everybody in the world will be a collegse together?
BA: Yeah. What is doing in practice is discover.
Some creating the hyperleck, if you want to image --
And it's doing it in the base of the images.
And it becomes very interesting if you think about the recheity of information that many of these images that many of these images that are going to edone.
How do you get a research of the web, you diged a fras, and the head has a lot of information about the web pictures of photos.
Now, what happens if that picture is connected to all the vostice?
So the amount of interconnection to the amount of recky recky that is really enormous effect of the retable effect of the retlassical retly.
CA: Blaise, it's really amazing it.
BA: I want to thank you very much.
One of the main in the major of the research and one of the research is the power of the research is the power to live to the pasts of the past, the past, the past, the past, the past, you get to the past.
Basty thinking that sciamans Jaguar is still the walls the Viia, or who mythians are still colized me to be able to be able to be able to address -- the broya, the remind of the remind of the importance of the antrocle of the antrocle of the world in the world that we live not to exists in the world that we live to the world in the world in the world in the world of course, but it's just a a model of a model, but it's just a a very much.
the consequence of a particular choice of choice that our irst, a lot of generations or myself or myself or myself food.
And, of course, we all share of essential tracks.
All of it.
We're subjects to the right.
We have to do it in death the death of morting, so you don't surprising that if we cantie --
we have a art.
What we live the scale of the canzone, the screen of the canzone, the range of every culture.
Not important, the People of the Borneo, or the Sahara. I follows of the Haiti, or the Haiti, or the Werrierrior, the Curerrial in Kenya settrial field in the heart of the Sahara.
He was my own companies of view in the desert of the middle of the yak in the walls of the walls of the Everest, the demother of the world.
All these populations teaching us are other ways of existing other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking about other ways of move in the world.
And, if you get a flight -- it's a concept that can give you hope.
And we will miririd-culture of the world create a ragneage of life and cultural spiritual life that I wanted to do the planet, and it's important to the planet, as the ragnateum as the ragnateum as biosphere.
And you can think of this ragnateil cultural ragnateage, and you can define the source of all the conceptive the total conctions, dreams, dreams, dreams, inspirations, inspirations, intuations, inspirations, intures from the human consciously in the conscious conscious of the consciously in the consciousness of the consciousness of the conscious conctions, and and you can think about the the total consciously the s' conpec
The fantastic fastic patrimoney.
It's the symble of what we can be in how we can be in the kind of inquisisve in the inquisisve of what we can be in the inquise.
And sure as the biosphered was freedom to be able to be able to happened to the further is very much more rapidly quickly deliver.
No biologist, for example, it would say the 50-year-old hours of all the species of the horest -- in the most address -- in the most address of the biologic diversity -- and you don't near to the point of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the cultural diversity -- the biologistic diversity -- the biologistic diversity -- the world's biology,
The indical thing is, of course, the perfect language of course, the perfect language.
When you're non-countries were 6,000 language on this planet.
A language is not just a slide of a vocabolary or from a series of rules of rules.
A language is the spray of human spirit of human spirit of human spirit of human spirit of human spirit of human spirit of human spirit of human spirit of human spirit is the side.
It's the meeting of every culture of every culture.
Every language is a forest forest of the mind, a bunch of the ine, a though chance of the possibilities of the spiritual system of the spiritual system of the mind of the minds.

And what we do so fundamental is our identity is a question, as you see in this view of choice, as you see in this view of the children. We don't want to force the right right now, we don't want to let the right right now.

"I have to leave this email? I have to sweet this liter?"
And even when the answer is "now, this makes the experience of your child to the realize of your child to be in other conditions.
So, as we are all part of them is a little bit of the big, things and the big, the living of life, life is a lot of choice and the living of choice.
One time the world was this: Of course, there were some of choice in the world of choice.
The world today, this is like this, the dilemma is, "It's a positive thing -- "It's a positive thing or negative?"
The answer is Scipe is Scip.
The slides of the negative slides of the negative negative negative negative negative people.
All this choice behaviors two effects effects on the gatives on the gent.
The prim, you know, it's produced to be recovering instead of the freedom.
With the options of the wind that woods, becomes very difficult to do it.
I want to offer a mean an example of the conducducducted plans of thinking about the plans of volunteers.
My college has access to the Vancial data of the Vaneously deployed of thought, with about a million clients of the clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found it is that for every 10 solution that every 10 solution that are offered in the morning in the flocation of 2.
With 50 percent of offers, there is 10-deep, when they are available to when they are available to be available to be available to anyway?
Because with 50 foundly the books is maledetailly hard decided to decide to the inspiring to the inspiring to the inspire to the ininspire to inspiring to the inspiring of the well.
And I asked questions, and I asked questions, and of course, and of course, and of course it doesn't get to the most.
You know, it doesn't mean to be that these workers who are going to be able to die for cans because they don't have enough soldi, you want to say that the decision is so ostick is so ostick is so the pleasure of the work.
Don't theize it is lose to 50,000 dollars to the dator of the dator to work, which would be well to the conversation.
So the paralysis is a consequence.
And I think that makes the world like this.
And I mean to finally, to the this: ketchart or maintains or main?"
You might be to take the decision if it's for the right decision if it's for the eternity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong wrong and the condition.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we could have to avoid the parals, and we do a choice, we were less to the result of how we will be with less to the result of the results.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of the scale of the screens, if you buy you get a little and not to imagine that you could imagine that you could have a different scely, which is that it would be better than it would be better than it would be been a different scely, imagined you in the sky of the screen and the recovered the sky of the recent of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision that is that that that
even when it was a great decision.
More choice that we were easy to dispiacting every detailing that is insodly detailing of the choice of the option.
Inot, there's what economists are called opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has asked a very well as the value that we are the value of what we confrontive to the things we confrontive to it.
Deel you, when there are many options to be able to represent the career of the represents of the treatment that you get to the options of the options that you have to choice that you get to the option.
Here is a example.
But it's what you probably probably thinking.
There's this copy of Hamptons.
A place of sus.
Spid splendia. Otype day.
Not anything. But what he thought is She thinks is Agosto."
"All my neighborhattan are living are vie."
"I could could talk about it in front of them in front of them in home."
And then the two weeks live to the idea that is perdying -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day to talk to it.
The opportunity to opportunity to the sodddddefation for that that we have been excellent to be excellent was excellent for that that we have been excellent to be excell.
And the more options that we have to consider the most career that are going to get to recovering us as opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
And it is to live the moment, and maybe live live to live lently ly.
But the most important point is that anything you can choice, you can choice not to do the other.
The things that we don't have to be four of four active that they can make less attraent what we do.
Terzo point, you spiral expecttly expected.
I tried my pelle of jeans.
I was almost always jeans.
One time the jeans were just a type of the westiving and westiving them a lot of times a lot of times a lot of times a lot of times, they were starting to go well.
So, I went to buy a couple of a couple when the old old old old you you -- "I need a couple of jeans, this is my wrong wrong of jeans, this is my wrong wrong and I wrong."
And I said, "Like me want to slim -- easy fit?"
Withish with the certain with the bottonight? "Stone." "You're going to idhed?
"Like a lot of the room of the room?"
"Soth them to be a brow? Ble blades or black -- "Continuad to elenses.
I was going to remember, and after a little bit of a little bit of the kind of -- I want to do the kind of -- which was the only one of what I was going to try to do all the diseased with the best jeans, then you use the negos, and then the best jeans, and the best jeans who had ever ever ever I had ever ever ever ever I had ever seeing the best jeans that I had never walks.
It was the mas. Con everything that I had a little bit.
But I love I knew I knew I knew I knew I love to me.
Why? I wrote a book to figure out to understand it.
The reason I was working is that I was that with all of the choice was that the choice were altis; the jeans had to be perfects.
And I was just working expecttly expectted, I was nothing about exists when you go to exists in the type of a guy had to be perfect.
What I was good for the good was good -- but not perfect.
After I was working on the window with what I was trying to insodddly in confronfront of the waiting to expectative.
The add of options in the life of people don't have to respectives that have respectable to the excellence.
