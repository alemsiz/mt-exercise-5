The last year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years has had the size of the United States <unk>, <unk> <unk> 40 percent.
So, this <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the ice.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> is, in a sense, the heart of the global <unk> system.
It's <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years.
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
As you see, you can see, <unk> to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which is the ice in summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years or more, it's like the blood, which is like the body.
In 25 years, so that, so it's so.
This is a problem because the <unk> are <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are huge <unk> of <unk> <unk> that, <unk> are <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
We're going to <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>, that <unk> <unk>, that's not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, it's already <unk> from water.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: She's good. The question is if you <unk> it.
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk>.
This is a river <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> has never <unk> <unk> <unk> levels.
This is the <unk> river, in the <unk> of the <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> level of the sea level of the <unk> <unk>, here is where <unk> the sea sea.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
<unk> other side of the planet: <unk>, the largest <unk> of ice ice on the planet.
The last month, the last month, <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> level, like <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the third largest <unk> of ice, you know, that a few years ago, that's <unk>.
<unk> 40 percent of the world population <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk>: this <unk> is the source of water <unk> of this city.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when we <unk>, it's the same thing to water.
In California, <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> 40 percent.
The <unk> <unk> are in crisis.
<unk>, as you have read, they're <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk>.
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years of the <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the <unk>.
If you look at the context context, if you can see the <unk>.
In the last five years, we've <unk> <unk> million <unk> of CO2 every 24 million <unk> in the oceans every day.
Look at the <unk> area, from the <unk> <unk>, from <unk>, and on both the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean.
The most <unk> of the global global <unk>, together, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
The oil is a problem, and the <unk> is even even even even.
The United States are one of the two countries with <unk> <unk>, together.
And it's going to build a lot of other <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> of the way.
These are the <unk> projects in the last years and some <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And so, there's a <unk> politics in our country.
The <unk> of the <unk> and oil <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year for <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
<unk> image I'm going to <unk> me something --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where I live live, there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
Maybe you've seen it on the <unk>.
This is the second <unk> <unk> in America.
It's happened around it.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> of <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>, it's a kind of <unk> and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and it's <unk> in America, and it's to grow our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk>.
It's a good price, <unk> and <unk> it.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> here is a lot of <unk> <unk>.
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk>.
This is a one of them, a part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk>, we see the changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business business.
So, this <unk> our <unk> is <unk> a big <unk> of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public public <unk> and <unk> the truth.
In fact, the <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it's also a good <unk>.
So, we don't <unk> change.
We're going to do it.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of.
So, I <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> for how much <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! The machines are a little <unk>, but this is the sound of the technology of the <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> is between the <unk> of the global global global <unk>, but the <unk> technology of <unk> that change.
<unk> a look at this is the <unk> technology.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the national <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: The <unk> is in the crisis, the <unk>, the national crisis.
The <unk> that <unk> all: our <unk> from the <unk> <unk>, like the <unk> <unk> and oil <unk>.
Now, there's a new, <unk> solution to <unk> it.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy, in 10 years.
A <unk> <unk> for <unk> America to work, <unk> more <unk>, and to help <unk> the global <unk>.
<unk>, a solution that we're going to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> of the more.
<unk>: This is the last.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: It's <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk>, to <unk> from the <unk> that we <unk> our planet planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, the sun, a new <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> for <unk> places for work.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: A old old <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go, you go from the <unk>.
If you want to go, you go back, you go back, "If you want to go, you go back,
We need to go back, quickly.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED <unk>, I got a <unk> on the <unk>.
And I'm going to <unk> <unk> to <unk> on how the car works.
So, I'm going to go. And for the other time, there were not, the <unk> is the largest <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is about a <unk> of <unk> the conditions that were less than a <unk> of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second.
All that's just <unk>.
This is the car <unk>.
We're going to be these <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
This is what I work. It's called <unk> -- it's <unk> <unk> feet and has a <unk> <unk> feet.
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk>.
The 10 <unk> of the last year we <unk> the car for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of control.
It's an image of the first <unk> particles that had done all the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles in the <unk>.
In other words, when I <unk> that the <unk> <unk>, <unk> that the car <unk>, which is a big <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to <unk> <unk> or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> <unk> was this.
That means we have a <unk> impact over over the scientific <unk>.
<unk> a week later, there was a problem with the car, it had to be <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of the <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you <unk> the <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true.
And instead can do it because when they're very <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, in <unk> <unk> degrees, to a <unk> temperature at that space between the <unk> of the space of the <unk> of the space of the <unk>.
In one of the <unk> between the most <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, there was a <unk> of <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and that's <unk> about 30 <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We <unk> and <unk>.
Now, we're <unk> all to their <unk>.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be new <unk>.
We <unk> it, and we <unk> to get the data to <unk> or <unk>, and so our <unk> to find out what the <unk> are the <unk> that <unk> the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and <unk> <unk>.
I think that's so hard, the fact that it's so hard, I think it's the value of things like <unk>.
I want to <unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk>, which, <unk>, <unk>, in <unk> <unk> <unk> experiments, he said, "<unk> <unk> <unk>, he said," "<unk> is <unk> to the human mind how to <unk> the <unk> of the human mind how to <unk> <unk>, that the <unk> of science are not <unk>, that we <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>,
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when, children, <unk>, <unk>.
As <unk> as <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>,
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> most of the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> <unk> of our <unk> <unk> with objects, together, together, and to my <unk> <unk> <unk>, and I started <unk> <unk>, I started <unk> to <unk>: "And if you use a computer, instead of a computer, instead of <unk> <unk>, and then, instead of a <unk> <unk>, and then, with my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
and <unk> to <unk>?
The question was so interesting that we <unk> to explore the answer, building the answer, building the answer,
In a few words, a <unk>, a computer <unk> like a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk>, a computer <unk> like a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with the hand, they can <unk> them, and they have a <unk> and a radio <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, like <unk>, you can just <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> is the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> information for <unk>.
And as as the <unk> that they become more <unk>, <unk> of the other, and then <unk> as they're more <unk>, <unk> of the other, of the other, as we can build and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you: if you <unk> it in a way, the video <unk> <unk>, if you <unk> from the other <unk> back.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> of other.
If you <unk>, you know what it's going to be around.
If they're <unk>, you can <unk> it, and they can <unk> it a little bit.
If they're <unk>, you can <unk> it, and they can <unk> it a little bit.
They also also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We've <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of <unk> was the <unk> of <unk> <unk> on data, for example, for example, "<unk> <unk> a color like a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> the color in the <unk> in the <unk>, where you're <unk>.
and I can <unk> for <unk> color in the <unk>, where you <unk>.
If you <unk> too, we can <unk> a little bit about it.
I'm also <unk> to <unk>, as the <unk>, as the <unk>, and games where people can try things things things to try things things, and they're <unk> the results.
Now, I'm --
This is a <unk> <unk> that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a <unk> of words that's <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, to <unk>, every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, <unk>, to every <unk> <unk>, and <unk> a letter, and as <unk> <unk> words, and while you <unk> words, he's <unk> <unk> in a <unk>.
Then, after about 30 seconds, and you have a new <unk> and new possibility to <unk> and new possibility to try.
Thank you.
Here's the children <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>, I did it in the <unk> <unk>, and I <unk> a video.
They are <unk> very much.
And one of the interesting things like this <unk> is that you don't have to be a lot of <unk>.
<unk> only, "<unk> of the words," and they know what to do.
Here's other people who are <unk>.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, there's the most young,, right.
It's actually wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> building a <unk> for the <unk> of <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the <unk>, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the <unk>, <unk> their <unk>.
Here's doing it out the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now, he <unk> a <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work!
So, we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can make the <unk> of the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
-- I'm going to be a story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the final <unk>, and it can decide him as you <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with the final <unk>, and it can decide him as you <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example that I have the time to show you is a <unk>, for <unk> and <unk> music music.
It's a <unk>, for <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> <unk> here from <unk> as a <unk>, and the <unk>.
<unk> of these has four different <unk>, and you can have to <unk>.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's just doing <unk> a <unk> sound, "and a <unk> <unk>."
These are actually that you can control from the live, as the <unk> and the <unk>.
We <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk>.
And then there are the <unk>, as long and <unk>, that's going to <unk> the whole sequence.
<unk> as it works.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk>, "<unk>," <unk> in a series, the other <unk>, <unk>.
Now, you'll go to a <unk> line.
<unk>: Now, <unk> <unk>: Now, <unk> <unk>:
<unk>: <unk>: And now we <unk> the <unk> to <unk>, so I can control the <unk> of the live.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the whole time to the <unk> <unk> the whole time or the other.
<unk>: <unk>: And now we <unk> the <unk> to give more <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the <unk> <unk>. "
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> on the left <unk>. "
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> and more <unk> to how to work work and body body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this, and some possibility that we're going to get out of the lab.
The concept I want to <unk> is that's <unk> this new generation of objects to <unk> with the media <unk>, which <unk> information information in our world world that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time now I'm not going to talk about you.
They're a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk> books, but it's more than this, of course.
It's also love and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't like that it can change.
But, I said this, something particular is happened in my life and in my career, which has <unk> to <unk> the entire <unk> with this work.
The particular thing is that I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that <unk> <unk> now, people <unk> me as if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
<unk> from me now, I say, "You don't know, you know, you don't know that they don't be able to do better?
You don't think that you can be able to write for all the life without more to create a book that can <unk> someone? "
What can you <unk> to someone? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could go, I remember the most of it, I remember, I'm going to say people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> to be <unk> by <unk>.
And the people said, "Don't <unk> to have happened?
You don't think that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>?
You don't think that <unk> to do this <unk> for all the life of the life, and to die on a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>? "
So, you know,
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is: "You know,"
So, I'm afraid of all the things.
I always had <unk>.
And I also think of the other things that people don't have <unk>.
How <unk> and other things <unk>.
But, for how about the <unk> I thought I was and <unk> <unk> is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anybody <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a work that you feel <unk> to do.
But what's so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> about <unk> <unk> about health <unk> in a way that other <unk> don't do it?
How do my father, for example, he was a <unk> and I didn't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of <unk>?
There was never -- that <unk> of the <unk> John, how do it?
<unk>'t you know that, you know, <unk>?
<unk>, the engineers like a group of course, they don't have, in the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not only <unk>, but it's not just <unk>, but it's <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And not <unk> else that look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, <unk> young and often as young.
And also the ones that they don't seem to be <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before they were going to die, in the last <unk> said, "Every book has a little bit more" <unk> about the work of their life.
But it's not <unk> <unk> when we've heard these things so long that we've heard these things so much as we've got a lot of <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some way and that art, to <unk> and that art, to <unk> and <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> to <unk> it to all here today is, you're <unk> with this idea?
You go back this thing -- because it also <unk> by a <unk> distance to me not, it's good for nothing.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better <unk> our big <unk> to live live.
And I know that, in my case -- in my <unk> situation -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which are in my career.
<unk> -- look at <unk>, I'm pretty young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that any <unk> now in the world as the work that I would <unk> from the world as the <unk> <unk> of my last book book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all more and friends here -- is <unk> that my big success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, that thinking!
You know this is the kind of thinking that door a person to <unk> <unk> at the <unk> <unk>, and I don't want to do it.
I'm going to continue to do this work that I love.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so it looks, after many <unk>, that the way to work to write, and I'm going to write it, OK?
I have to have a <unk> distance of <unk> between me, which I'm <unk>, and my natural <unk> on what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the natural <unk> <unk>, and as <unk> to look at the time, to look at the time, to find other society, to find out of the best ideas and <unk> ideas and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> ideas to have better <unk> ideas and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>.
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research has <unk> me to <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk> because it's <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that the creativity of the men, OK?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and that <unk> to the men, and that <unk> to the <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity. "
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> from from <unk>.
The <unk> were the same idea, but <unk> that kind of spirit without a <unk>.
The which is <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really <unk> that a <unk> was a particularly somebody was a <unk>.
<unk> that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of a artist, a little like <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> out of <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the artist and <unk> <unk> the <unk> of that work.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, that's the distance of what I'm going to <unk> you from the results of your work.
And all of <unk> that was so that <unk>, right?
So, artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like example, how example example is too <unk>, no?
If your work was <unk> not <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, all of <unk> that <unk> was <unk> by this <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If your work, it was not all <unk> your work, it's not all <unk>?
All of all the <unk> that's your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a lot of time.
And then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk>, and <unk> this big idea, and we <unk> this big idea, the human <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people to think that the <unk> creativity <unk>.
And for the first time in the story, it's going to <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a rather than a person with the <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think that was a big <unk>.
I think I think that I would have to be like a <unk> like a <unk> like a <unk> like the source, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> a <unk> responsibility a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's like to ask someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> and make all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think it's, and I think it's, and now?
Can we <unk> it?
It will go back to a more <unk> of the relationship between human <unk> and <unk>.
Or maybe it's not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking about <unk> years of <unk>.
And probably there's probably people in the audience that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, <unk>, you know, people <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects.
You probably probably don't know about this thing.
But the question I want to <unk> is -- why don't?
Why don't you <unk> it in this?
Because it's more than any other thing that has ever heard for the <unk> of the <unk> process.
A process that's a process, as everybody ever <unk> to do something -- so, <unk>, all here -- it's not <unk> <unk>.
And, in fact, it can be completely <unk>.
I did this <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> <unk>, which has now 90 years, but that was a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> it, in the <unk>, and then <unk> it, in the <unk> <unk>, and then <unk>, if a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And he said that it was like a <unk> <unk> air.
And that <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk>.
And I <unk> it, because he <unk> the earth under his feet.
<unk> to have one thing to have one thing to do that, and was, words, "<unk> like a <unk>."
And so I was <unk> to home and it was <unk> by this <unk>, and it would have to take a piece of paper and a <unk> <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on the page.
<unk> times, they don't get enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and she would <unk> it and she would <unk> it to <unk> through the <unk> and she would <unk> to <unk> through the <unk>, to be <unk> through the <unk>, and how she said, "another <unk>."
And then there were the time -- this piece never -- there were the moments that was almost <unk>, right?
So, it was <unk> home and was trying to <unk> and the <unk> <unk> through, and <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the while that was <unk>, and he said, and then he was like if you <unk> with the other hand and <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> and <unk>, but at the last word to the first word.
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not all my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; it's <unk> every day and <unk> and <unk> and work and <unk> and work and <unk> on the <unk>.
But even I was, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that what, sometimes.
And I think that many of you the <unk> did.
You know, even if the work and the ideas I <unk> <unk> from a certain source of <unk>. I can't <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> to do it in it way we don't have to <unk>, but rather, that <unk> <unk>?
So how I'm going to be a better example that I have is the <unk> <unk>, which I've <unk> different years ago for a <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, and you know, for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, trying to control, <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then <unk>, <unk>, and a day when she was <unk> on a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> all for him.
<unk> <unk>, and all of a <unk> <unk>, which comes into his head as a <unk> <unk>, which comes in his head as the <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and the <unk>, but it's <unk>, and the <unk>, but it's not how to <unk>.
It's no piece of paper, he didn't have a <unk>, it's not a <unk>.
So, it starts to feel this kind of <unk> <unk> to grow in him, "I'm going to <unk>, and <unk> <unk> from this song.
I'm not enough <unk> and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of go in the <unk>, it's <unk>.
<unk> the entire process <unk> and made something completely new.
<unk> just the sky and said, "<unk>," You know, you know, you see that I'm <unk>? "
"You know, you know, I'm going to write a song now?
If you really want to <unk>, you will <unk> it, you can <unk> care of you.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> <unk> another today.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his process <unk> <unk> after this.
It's not the work, the work was still <unk> as always as it.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that was <unk> when I was <unk> when we <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that's <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> back where it was <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
But I'm going to be <unk> this <unk>, and this <unk> <unk> and this <unk> and <unk> that <unk> and <unk> that it was not <unk>.
So how I <unk> that story to change a little bit as well, I'm going to be a time that I <unk> it.
This idea, I was <unk> when I was <unk>, "<unk>," and <unk>, "and <unk> in a <unk> of those <unk> in which we're working on something and we can start thinking that's a <unk>, and we can think that it will be a <unk>, which is going to be a <unk>, which is going to be a <unk>,
It's not just <unk>, just the <unk> book.
And I'm going to think about <unk> this project.
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> to <unk> air and <unk>.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> and <unk> my <unk> in the room.
And I said to <unk>, "<unk>, what, we know, both, we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> <unk>.
Because as you see I'm <unk> all that I'm <unk>, I don't have more than this.
So if you want it to <unk> and do your part, you have to do it and do your part.
Okay. But if you don't do it, you know what, I don't have anything.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I want to say that was <unk> I'm <unk> that I'm <unk> to do my part of "because -- the end is so, OK, <unk> in the <unk> of Africa, people are <unk> to <unk> to <unk> to <unk> hours to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> hours to <unk> and <unk> hours to <unk> hours to <unk> hours and hours to <unk> hours and hours to <unk> hours hours and <unk> hours.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk>.
But every so, I'm going to <unk>, and one of these artists are actually <unk>.
And I know, I know what I'm going to talk, because I know that you have seen, a <unk> <unk> so.
It was like the time, and the <unk> <unk> through a <unk> of <unk> and it was not <unk> different from the <unk>, and it was not a different <unk>, but it was like <unk>.
And a lot of a <unk> of the human.
But it's <unk> from the <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
And when this <unk>, the time, people <unk> what was, the <unk> with his name.
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God, God, God," God, "God.
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," which you can still hear in the <unk> or <unk>.
In <unk>, when a artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "
And it's <unk> because we need.
But, the problem comes the day after, for the <unk>, when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> and <unk> of God, there's no more.
It's just a <unk> with a lot of <unk> to <unk>, and maybe maybe never <unk> to <unk> that.
And maybe no one <unk> the name of God still, as <unk>, and so it has to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a life life.
But maybe it's not to be so <unk> if you can't believe, <unk>, that the most <unk> of your <unk> being from you.
But I just just <unk> that you're going to <unk> from a <unk> of this <unk> <unk> of your life that you have to go to <unk>.
And, you know, if we think in this way, it's all the way.
And so I started <unk>, and it's like, and it's a different few months during the <unk> of the book that <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>,
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> by this is not <unk>.
<unk>'t <unk>.
You can be <unk> to <unk> for your part, any of it, can be.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, you will <unk> to you <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for a only moment through your <unk> <unk>, then, "<unk>!"
<unk>, you do the same <unk> your <unk>.
And "<unk>!"
I think I think it's <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>!" You go to the same, even for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
As you know, I've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome, and that can <unk> and the discovery of new genes.
Now we're <unk> a new way: we started <unk> biology and now, we start <unk> to the digital <unk> of biology, we're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology.
We've always tried to <unk> big questions.
"<unk> is the life?" It's something that many <unk> I think they have <unk> to understand <unk> <unk>.
We tried to have a different <unk>, <unk> to <unk>.
We're <unk> by almost 20 years.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> <unk> to go from the <unk> of biology in the digital world of the computer.
Now, we <unk> us: we can <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the kind of the <unk> of the <unk> that can <unk> in the lab.
And we tried to <unk> the genome for <unk> a <unk> <unk>, more small.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> genes that are here.
But when we <unk> a look at its <unk> <unk>, it's simple <unk> to our own.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one time, it's very <unk> that can take a <unk> cell cell cell cell <unk>.
So, I <unk> that the only <unk> <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> for some of these questions.
So, we started the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>? "
Can the <unk> <unk> <unk> of these big molecules that we never had been able to create before we have ever been able to create before you?
And, in the case, we can make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of material material <unk> <unk>.
The speed with which we are able to <unk> life life is <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
The ability to write the code, instead, instead, rather <unk>, but it's <unk>.
And our most <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
We've <unk> more than 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> before <unk>,
But we found that <unk> DNA is very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of machines in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA, <unk> <unk>, and it's a <unk> process: the most <unk> is a <unk> <unk>.
So we had to develop a new <unk> for <unk> these <unk> and <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, to <unk>, to start <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a little virus that bacteria.
We have <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> <unk>.
The interesting is when we took this piece of material <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> particles are <unk> by cells, they're <unk> by cells, they're <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I talked about about the <unk> <unk> industry that they have <unk> <unk> this model.
They have more than you.
So, what this is a situation where the software can actually build the software in a <unk> system.
But I'm going to do things in the big.
They were building the entire <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
They are more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought of <unk> in <unk> <unk> size, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell cell cell cell cell cell.
The <unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> information in a computer, these have to be very <unk>.
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We found out, <unk>, 30 <unk>, if you were going to be able to work it.
One of the process is <unk> <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build more small <unk> that <unk> together.
<unk> <unk> <unk> here.
You know, you know, you know, we've got to <unk>.
So, we have a <unk> code on four <unk>: <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and there's a <unk> of <unk> for every <unk>.
So we can use the code for <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did at the beginning was <unk>.
Some of the <unk> were <unk> by the fact that it was not <unk>.
We have <unk> these <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
There are <unk> that we <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them to get to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, we've got a <unk> these <unk> in <unk> so we're <unk> that we're <unk> to create a extremely <unk> <unk> <unk> as you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
When I started to <unk> these <unk>, more than 100 <unk>, not <unk> to <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
It comes to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> biology.
So we've <unk> other <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> <unk> for <unk> DNA.
Here's a example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk>.
In 12 -- 24 hours it's just like it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can <unk> completely <unk>.
We're going to live in <unk>.
They're absolutely absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and you <unk> to find new <unk> of water.
In fact, NASA has shown that this is.
This is an image of the <unk> that we built using these <unk>, just using the <unk> design design of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a time of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we did a long time ago.
They are more <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> code.
It's the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> structure of a <unk> structure.
It has a <unk> <unk> at 300 million.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> <unk>, we <unk> <unk> <unk> pages for this code.
Now, how do we do it? How can we <unk> it?
Of course, by a <unk> virus is a <unk> game.
It's a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria.
It's the <unk> of the <unk> cells as our cells, as we can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is <unk> the process.
In the <unk> <unk> <unk>, it's instead of <unk> in the cell, but we <unk> <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> cell cell in another and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a kind of a <unk> <unk>.
The two different are how the men from the <unk>.
We have <unk> a few <unk> in the more way that we could decide what we want to have to <unk>.
The <unk> has <unk> with the <unk> <unk> in a way to <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the cell.
And <unk> <unk> that we didn't go over, but we tried to <unk> in there.
This is one of the largest <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species, <unk> species, a second or a third <unk> from some, <unk> in a <unk> <unk>, <unk> in a <unk> <unk>,
So who think about evolution as a only <unk> at evolution, as a <unk>, you know, it's not <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> DNA.
The <unk> that was in the cell cell cell didn't have a <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> the <unk> has it.
It's <unk>, and he <unk> the other <unk> like <unk> material, and we've <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk>.
It's become blue to the genes we've <unk>.
And in a short <unk> of time, all the <unk> of a kind of a kind of kind of a new species, <unk> on the new software, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, the <unk> are <unk>, and when we <unk> the <unk> code <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now, this might be <unk> <unk>, but we <unk> the software, we can change things things in a <unk> <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that I'm not going to <unk> -- but of it it's not about <unk> million years and a half million years and the evolution of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of <unk> <unk> new species.
Why do this?
I think that's enough when we think of our <unk>.
We're going to go from six billion and a half a half a few years.
Right to give a example: I was born in <unk>.
Now, there are three people on the planet to <unk>, in 40 years, there's four years, there's four years, there are going to be four.
We're <unk> problems now now, water and <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> for six billion and a half and a half billion people.
<unk> more <unk> to do it for nine billion.
<unk> more than five billion <unk>, more than 30 billion <unk> <unk>.
That means millions of <unk> a day.
When we're going to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process for <unk>, it's a huge challenge.
We have to <unk> that we have to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the material that we <unk> in the atmosphere.
And so, with the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> only a <unk> of <unk>, and think of how many different things are <unk> <unk> out.
Our <unk> are <unk> data from the reality and <unk> and our imagination.
Now, we have <unk>, because of these <unk> <unk> <unk>, to make what we call <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or try to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, <unk>, we can change, with a little team, and make more <unk> biology. And then we can be more <unk> biology.
And it's just a <unk> <unk>.
We can have to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we're working for being able to <unk> and design species to <unk>, and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how to be going to be.
We know exactly how their <unk> code.
Now, we're <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> generation.
You've seen that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We have <unk> <unk> of the second generation that <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> of <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> the food of the food and <unk> would be <unk> the <unk> of food and <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 in the matter of the <unk> that we're working for us that, and we think we can have the first <unk> of <unk> to <unk> generation in 18 months.
The light light <unk> with the CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> in the world, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk> in the ocean, about <unk> feet of <unk> <unk> <unk> of water.
<unk> <unk> by the CO2 using <unk> as the <unk> of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> the CO2, that can be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to <unk> this process.
So, to start a short think we can be able to <unk> what the question of "that the <unk> of" that's life is the whole thing to <unk> the whole whole industry.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where you can't it?
It's a main source of energy.
<unk>, we're working working for the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with the flu, we're always back to a year and with a dollar in the <unk>, and with a dollar in the right right.
I think what you can change building <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
Here's how the future might start <unk>, now, now, the tree evolution, <unk> evolution, <unk> evolution with bacteria, <unk>, <unk> cells.
We are so so much of the people.
Our goal is to do so much as long long to try to try to try to try to try to <unk>.
First of all, I'm going to show you, the most <unk>, the new technology that we've got to <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> a year ago. This is <unk>.
It's a <unk> environment where you can <unk> it's <unk> at local level that <unk> with a huge <unk> of data.
Here we're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a <unk> <unk>, <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big big the information that we see, how big are these <unk> of data or the images.
Most of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, but this example is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
It doesn't do any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any time. It's a very <unk> architecture.
This is a book, example of data, not images.
This is the <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, I think it's just about the <unk> and not images, we can do something like this, to see that it's a real <unk> of the <unk>, not a picture.
It might be a little way to read a <unk> book.
I don't <unk> it.
This is a more example. It's a <unk> number of <unk>.
Every image is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it's really a very <unk> experience, and the beautiful experience of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk> <unk>, which is for nature a half a <unk> <unk>.
We also did something with the <unk> of this number in particular of the <unk>.
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, much more <unk> than that you use in a normal <unk> and we've <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
So, what this <unk> <unk> to put to <unk> and other <unk>, not <unk> to be <unk>.
Of course, the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this is not going to <unk>, if you don't say we have <unk> to <unk> by <unk>.
These are all the streets in the United States, a <unk> image of NASA.
So now, I'm going to go to something else.
This is actually the live live in the Web, you can <unk> it.
It's a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> computer, very interesting <unk> <unk>, a student of the <unk> of Washington, with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's from the <unk>, <unk> from <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from another image and have this kind of experience to <unk> <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here has actually a meaning.
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> computers have <unk> these images together, in the <unk> places that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> all <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk>. Here's <unk>. So, you see the <unk> of a <unk> or <unk> of <unk>, and these things are all <unk>.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a much more <unk>.
I want to go to one of the <unk> data, and this <unk> <unk> <unk> that we've done for the first time, we've done for the first time to show you what it's really the key <unk> to show you what we really <unk> it in the <unk> <unk>, and it's not <unk> to <unk> the <unk> that we have in the website.
We had to have <unk> <unk> <unk> and forth.
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> images. And so on. <unk> <unk> and saying. <unk> of these <unk> <unk>.
So, I'm all <unk> <unk> from <unk> and you're all <unk> at the <unk> level in this way.
And it's possible to <unk> this way.
You know, I would never thought about it to work to work to <unk>.
It's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think that you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of <unk>: from those <unk> <unk> <unk>, a number <unk>, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can, I'm going to try to try to look at those <unk>.
So, a lot of <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> here is a few here is a series of <unk> -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> to physics of this environment.
The <unk> is that we can do things with the environment. This is now <unk> data from the whole <unk> of the whole <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> all of the data, from the <unk> <unk> and <unk> all of the data.
All the pictures are <unk> together, more than the <unk> <unk>.
You have a model of the entire earth that <unk>.
Think about this as a <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth.
It's something that <unk> in the <unk> of the people <unk> the <unk>, and the <unk> for who are <unk> with the use of the use.
They are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If someone is the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of those data, and I can use how to <unk> in that space, in that <unk> space, in that <unk> space, and I can have a social experience.
Of course, a <unk> of all of this is <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk> not only from <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk>.
Chris Anderson: I think that your software <unk> <unk> us to do is that you can be a certain point, in the next years, all the <unk> <unk> from anybody in the world world's <unk> <unk> together?
<unk>: Yeah. What's doing it.
It's creating the <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's doing this in the <unk> of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information that many of these images <unk> <unk>.
As a research of images on the Web, it's <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> page has a lot of information information about the images.
Now, what happens if that picture is going to <unk> all your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> that's a huge <unk>. It's a <unk> effect.
CA: <unk>, it's amazing.
<unk>: You're going to be very much.
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> that we can have the <unk> <unk> <unk>, between the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> in the <unk>, <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the plants.
<unk> thinking that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, or that the <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk>, or that in <unk>, or that in <unk>, for the <unk> <unk>, to remember the <unk> <unk>, and that the idea that the idea that the world we have no sense of the world that we have no <unk>, but only a sense of the world, but only <unk> <unk> <unk>,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of choices that our <unk> has done, or bad, so many <unk> ago.
And, of course, all of course, <unk> <unk>.
All <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
We need to <unk> the <unk> of death, so we don't <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art art.
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song, the <unk> of the <unk> of culture.
It doesn't matter that the <unk> of the <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>.
He was my <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, the <unk> mother's <unk> <unk>, the <unk> mother of the world.
All these <unk> <unk> us that are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of us to move in the world.
And if you <unk> a minute, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of the world <unk> <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the world and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> as the <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk>.
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk>, <unk> ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> in being <unk> by human imagination.
The <unk> is the <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as as as a <unk> <unk>.
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk>, and <unk> much more <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all the species was or the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> -- and it's <unk>, or -- and you can't even <unk> to <unk> <unk> -- and you can't even even even even even even even <unk> in the <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> diversity of the <unk> diversity --
The <unk> of this is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A <unk> language is not just from a <unk> or a series of rules rules.
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the middle with which the <unk> of every culture comes in the world material.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, while we're sitting here to <unk>, at least half the children is not more <unk> in the <unk> of the children.
They're not more <unk> to the children, which means, less than not to <unk> something, which are already death.
What there's more <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk>, of being the last to talk about a language, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the children?
This <unk> <unk> <unk> was a few weeks of every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks, and it <unk> with it <unk> <unk> a <unk> language.
And I know that somebody of you <unk> "is not better?
The world would not be a better place if you <unk> all the same language? "<unk>, then we're going to <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> a <unk> thing that means to be able to talk about their language.
Now, I'd like to make a journey through the <unk> --
a little <unk> journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us <unk> that when I say, "different ways of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> for example, this <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, which <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that's not able to <unk> the blue color of the blue <unk> because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the forest, from the <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule, <unk> "<unk>": "<unk>" <unk> "," You have to <unk> a different language.
All this has <unk> in the past <unk>, but it's that in these families <unk> that they are <unk> or seven <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> one language.
It's going to go to and then <unk> to talk about it.
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> with the which I've been, the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, a incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in the <unk>.
In the <unk> five <unk> have <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
They did <unk> from the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, which this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> had never seen anything.
They <unk> the picture from the land, they <unk> to research a form or a <unk>, and they don't <unk>, they <unk> it, they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> not only <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> between them.
<unk> percent of the <unk> <unk> was <unk> by their own.
We're <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two cases of the natural <unk> and when we've <unk> for it, they <unk> that one of them was so that he's dead, and then they <unk> it.
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal animal from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species.
<unk> years old, I was <unk> a really interesting <unk> when my <unk> of <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to do the <unk>.
So, to give a sense of <unk>, I would have to understand culture and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk>.
It's pretty much a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world.
<unk> interesting.
If you <unk> to <unk> the world, what would you <unk> the world, what would you <unk>?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent is always <unk>, thinking that Africa's <unk> doesn't have <unk> <unk>. And instead and the <unk> is not the other that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
What makes the interesting <unk> is the <unk> <unk> between life and death.
So the <unk> <unk> are <unk>.
The <unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the live in the <unk>.
So, this <unk> <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk> <unk>.
We <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> God. "
And from the moment that you're <unk>, is the spirit that you can be <unk>, how can you have the <unk> of the <unk>?
So, you know, these incredible events: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a pretty <unk> of the power of the power of the power of the mind when it's <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> all the <unk> with the <unk> that I've been <unk> the most <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>.
In a continent of blood <unk>, this <unk> never been <unk> by the <unk>.
And so, I'm <unk> by a <unk>, but they <unk> is amazing.
The young young <unk> are <unk> from the families, and they live in a world world, and they live in a world world of <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> for 18 years.
Two years of nine years <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So this time, they're <unk> to <unk> values, values that they <unk> and only their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of this incredible <unk>, they're <unk> <unk> out and for the first time in their life, at the age of 18 years, see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, all that they have been <unk> in <unk> theory, that they have learned in <unk> theory in <unk> theory, and that's <unk> and <unk>.
"<unk>? <unk> how I said.
It's <unk>. Now, it's going to be <unk>. "
They call <unk> more more and they say that we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world.
This level level is extremely important.
When we think of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the old <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe maybe <unk> <unk> and maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> <unk> to the Earth.
The <unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> or <unk> by the <unk>.
There's no space for these things in the <unk> or in the <unk> <unk>, but for the time and <unk>, they created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk> not on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, but on a <unk> <unk>, but on a <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> of the human <unk>, it can live in the Earth because it's <unk> by the human <unk> of the human <unk>.
What does that mean?
<unk> that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> is a human <unk> and <unk> is a different <unk> and <unk> <unk> a different <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain of <unk> that <unk> that <unk> a mountain of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
That's the <unk> of a <unk>, or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What is interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> between the <unk> and the natural world.
I'm <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
And that has made me a different human friends that they believe that the <unk> are <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you can <unk> that these <unk> can make very different, <unk>, to start trying to understand some of them <unk> <unk>.
I've <unk> this picture at <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes it fascinating <unk> is not the potential of the <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk> by two things.
So, in the side, this <unk> <unk> that <unk> has a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> a little bit of the <unk>, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to <unk>, <unk>.
If you'll see the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk>, that they do from a different <unk> of species, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. <unk>'t make a <unk> of the reality; it's not a <unk> of the reality, the <unk> of the reality,
<unk> often with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, Richard <unk>, the man who <unk> <unk> was <unk>, with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the years of <unk> in the <unk>.
My <unk> is not <unk> these <unk> as <unk> as <unk> because if you're not done, you can't tell any of being <unk>.
It's possible <unk> <unk> only if you can <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
Now, it's the beautiful: the <unk> that are <unk> <unk>, the same kind of <unk>, the same <unk> for <unk>. The question: in a <unk> of <unk> species of <unk> <unk> <unk> -- how these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We use the big <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if you <unk> to <unk>, we <unk> <unk>, "<unk> plants."
What does that mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes <unk> in the same species.
If the <unk> as <unk> their <unk> <unk> us, "<unk> <unk> <unk> of plants, the rest of plants, the rest of the <unk>."
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> in a night of the moon and <unk> with a different <unk>.
With this is not <unk> to <unk>, but it's much more interesting that <unk> <unk>.
Now, <unk> the problem is that also that the ones of us who have to the heart <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> them, but in some way to the <unk> of the story of the history of the history of the history of the story of the story of the story, and <unk>.
In fact, the <unk> century, 300 years, not <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk>, but rather like it was in which we <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the planet. Now the <unk> of the planet, and the planet of the planet. Now the planet is not the change. Now the change. Now the change. Now the <unk> century. Now,
All the <unk> through the <unk> were <unk> in a <unk> for new possibility of life.
And the problem is not the technology is not the technology.
The <unk> <unk> don't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put out and <unk> as the <unk> don't have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's the power of <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And if you look at the world, I'm going to <unk> that these are not <unk> <unk>.
They are <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that are <unk> <unk> that are <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that <unk> <unk>, and now <unk> to a generation, and now <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're going to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in the case of the <unk>, are the <unk> of the <unk>.
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> of politics.
As <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> physics of a <unk>, is <unk> to <unk> level, but the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk>, not just <unk>, it's not <unk>, but <unk> in some <unk>, because it <unk> <unk> in some <unk> of the development.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until the beginning.
I have the <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only it's the <unk> <unk> that I <unk> talk about.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
The father's father was <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
The thing that means that was <unk> to the <unk> of the Chinese <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk>.
It was <unk> to <unk> in <unk> age of two years <unk> <unk>, because he didn't have any of him, because it didn't have any of him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in the field of <unk>.
A day has <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> and, for this <unk>, was <unk> to work for seven years.
The pain of the <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> is from <unk>.
And then, it's all <unk> to a choice.
<unk> <unk> in the world of the <unk> or we want to <unk> the <unk> of the diversity?
The big <unk> <unk> <unk>, before he said that his most great <unk> <unk> <unk> that was that, in our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to this <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the human imagination, not only <unk> the <unk> of human imagination, but a day <unk> <unk> that were <unk> <unk> that we had other <unk>.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>, which has given us, that has done us to <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world <unk> <unk> <unk> has to <unk> 300 years.
That <unk> story, I don't know that we have the answers to all the challenges that we <unk> to go.
When we're going to say, we're asked what we want to be human, <unk> with <unk> <unk> different <unk>.
And that's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are: a <unk> species, that has to be a <unk>, and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there's great moments of <unk>.
I've <unk> this picture on the <unk> of the <unk> island of <unk>, when I went to <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and this man, <unk>, <unk> me the <unk> story of his <unk>.
The government <unk> is not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and the years of the <unk> and the years of 50 to <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> all the <unk>, and all the <unk>.
You know that <unk> doesn't <unk> the cold, it's <unk>.
The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of fish.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> by night or the <unk> <unk> <unk> or the <unk> that <unk>.
It's <unk> on, it's <unk> <unk> and <unk> in their hand. When I <unk> and <unk> in their hand. When I did it, they <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and he <unk> a <unk>.
It <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, he's <unk> a dog.
It <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> <unk>, has <unk> another dog and it's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> <unk> to talk about <unk>? [<unk> <unk>. And this, in different ways, <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> the government <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of a <unk> area of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. <unk> all the resources <unk>.
One example of how a <unk> <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, to end, I think it's pretty much <unk> at least who was in these <unk> areas of the planet, we know that they're not <unk>.
For somebody is home.
<unk> <unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time. And for us, the dreams of these children, become part of the <unk> of hope.
So, we <unk> <unk> <unk>, we have <unk> that <unk> <unk> never <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> --
[<unk> <unk> are not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell stories of the world. Every month our <unk> <unk> <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> from millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience in places of <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk>, and they <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and we have to find a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> diversity, and we have to find a <unk> world and <unk> in a world and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in a world world.
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you've heard and <unk> <unk> some <unk>, in the case, I'm not going to be <unk>.
I want to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk>."
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> society <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens." The way to do it is <unk> <unk>. "
The reason is, from one side, in fact that the freedom is in the same as a value, is <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for human beings.
<unk> is in fact that if we are <unk>, each of us to do that we can <unk> our <unk>, without any one that we <unk> our <unk>, without any one that we're going to be in our own.
The way to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> is <unk>.
The most choices are, more choices are <unk>, and more, and more is their freedom, more choices is their <unk>.
This, <unk>, it's so <unk> in the society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I'm going to <unk> a simple <unk> on the <unk> for <unk>.
In my <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, without <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Here's how the <unk>.
Then you go to the <unk> of <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> <unk>, there's a big number of <unk> <unk>.
We can make six million of different <unk> using the <unk> that there are a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: The world of the <unk> <unk>.
One time, when I was a child, they could get all the services <unk>, to <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
One of what, between the other, was that the phone <unk> never.
These are <unk>.
Now, we have a <unk> <unk> <unk>, especially between the <unk> cell phones.
Here's the <unk> cell phones.
My <unk> is what in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> for the <unk> <unk>.
If you have no <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, you're very <unk> that you're <unk>.
And what is that the end is that people <unk> in the <unk> and it does the answer? And you know, the answer is the answer is, "No."
It's not possible to buy a phone that doesn't <unk> things.
So, in other other <unk> of life that are much more important than the <unk>, the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>, not that's not going to <unk> the United States that you have to do it.
Instead, I'm going to go from the <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, or <unk>, or <unk>" "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> <unk> these <unk> and these <unk>. What do? "
You know, "<unk>, what do do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk> these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> it has these <unk> and these <unk> and these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you say, "<unk> if she was," What would you say? "
And the <unk>: "But I'm not she's she's not her."
The result of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>," <unk> that's a beautiful thing.
But actually, it's not that a <unk> <unk> the <unk> and the responsibility to make decisions from somebody who knows something, <unk> the <unk>, to <unk> the other people who don't know -- and so it's not <unk> -- and so it's not about it, and so in <unk> <unk> to make it.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk> <unk>, <unk> people like me and you, that if you think it's not any sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk> them?
The answer is that they want to <unk> the <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of the fundamental thing as our <unk> is a question of choice, as you see in this <unk>, "We don't want the children. We want to <unk> their <unk>." You don't <unk> a <unk>: we have to <unk>.
And we can <unk> them how many times we <unk>.
The which means that every <unk>, at the <unk>, you have to decide that kind of person.
I'm going to go to the family and the <unk>, <unk> of the <unk>, it was that you <unk> the most soon as possible, and you will <unk> to make children children the <unk> as possible possible.
The only real choice was with who, not, when, and that's not going to do it after.
<unk>, all it's really to play.
They're going to be very smart, and they <unk> their 20 percent in a time.
And because they're not less <unk>, because they're not <unk>.
But why are <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> or not? <unk> or not? "
"<unk> <unk> <unk> later? I have to think before?
They are <unk> <unk>.
And they're trying to answer these questions, even if this <unk> doesn't <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to really have to be important.
Now, the work: we are <unk>, like <unk> <unk>, because technology allows us to work every day, every day, every day, from every day of the planet, <unk> that's <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I'm not going to say, where the <unk> works.
I don't say, because I want to use it, because I want to use it.
What is, this incredible freedom to have about the work? It's that we have to <unk>, <unk> in every moment, if we need to work or not.
We can go to see our son to <unk>, with the phone in the other, and the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, on the <unk>.
And if I'm all <unk>, every minute that we see our son, we're also <unk>, "I'm going to answer this called"? "
"I have to answer this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And when the answer is, "no," ", this makes the experience of your son, very different than what it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part, we look at all, and big material, and <unk>, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibility, but it was a question of choice.
The world of today is, "<unk> is," It's a <unk> thing, or <unk>? "
The answer is <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> them all, so I'm going to talk about the <unk>.
<unk> this choice <unk> <unk> two actually <unk> on people.
The first, <unk>, is that <unk> <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> in which is very hard to do it.
I'll give you a <unk> example: a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> society <unk>, with a million <unk> <unk> <unk>, with a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> in different <unk>.
What she found out is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in the most, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> of the two percent.
With 50 <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent in the less than when they are just <unk> to <unk> them. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> in the <unk> of what you have, and the <unk> choice is <unk> to <unk>.
And in <unk>, and still <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> it never.
<unk> that doesn't mean that these <unk> from <unk> food to <unk> <unk> for <unk> food for <unk>, because they don't have enough money, it's so <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the work.
They're not <unk>, they're <unk> to <unk> <unk> for a year from <unk> <unk>, which would be <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
So the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> choices.
And I think that <unk> the world.
"And to end, for the <unk>: <unk> or <unk>?"
You know, it's going to be going to take the right decision, right?
You don't want to have the wrong wrong, and <unk> the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we can <unk> to <unk> the <unk> and make a choice, the end of how to <unk> <unk>, as <unk> <unk> <unk>, with the <unk> of how to <unk> <unk>.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of <unk> between what, if you have a lot of <unk>, it's easy easy to imagine that they could make a different choice that would be better. And that's that happens is that <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> us to <unk> us to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was also when it was a <unk> decision.
The most choices is, more choices is <unk> to <unk> that's <unk> of the <unk> choice.
<unk>, there's what they call <unk> <unk>.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very good as the value that we <unk> things that we <unk>.
<unk>, when there are many <unk> <unk>, is easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and being less <unk> of the <unk> that's choice.
Here's a example. I'm going to <unk> with all the New York.
But that's what you probably <unk>.
There's this <unk> to the <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all for them.
It's not <unk>. But what he's, "Well, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> to <unk> are <unk>."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> right right in front of the home."
And it's two weeks of the idea that's <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of where you want.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for that we have, when the choice was <unk>.
And the most <unk> that we have <unk>, the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> as <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> <unk> says a lot of things.
We're going to be the time, and maybe the live live <unk>.
But the most important is that any important is that you will <unk>, you're not going to do the other.
The things that are not <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make it less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I tried on my skin <unk> a new <unk>.
<unk> almost always <unk>.
One time the <unk> were just a kind of <unk>, they were <unk> and <unk>, they were <unk>, only after <unk> <unk> a lot of times, and they're going to go good.
So, I went to <unk> a new when the <unk> were <unk>, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
The <unk> said, "<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
<unk> <unk> or <unk>? "<unk> or <unk>?" <unk> "or" <unk> "<unk>" or "<unk>"?
"Do you want to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> --" <unk> <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little bit I was <unk>, "I mean," I want the only "" "<unk> didn't know what it was so for a time. I'm going to <unk> it, and then <unk> by the <unk>, and then <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> that I've ever had.
It was the <unk>. With all that <unk> the <unk>.
But it <unk> me, it's going to be <unk>.
Why? I wrote a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was going to know, it's with all the choice of my <unk> were <unk>, <unk> to be <unk>.
And I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't <unk> me when I was just a kind of like, but when we <unk> only one kind of a perfect <unk>, at least a kind of being perfect.
What I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After <unk> what I was <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in life in the life of people don't know that they have the <unk> of the same <unk>.
And this <unk> less <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of the <unk> <unk> if you get it.
Because if you <unk>, I'm not talking about what I'm talking about it.
The truth is more to this.
"It was better when he was more" The reason that was better when he was better when it was <unk>, it was <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world we live live in the world we live in <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are the things are at the <unk> of the <unk>.
You never <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, because your <unk>, my <unk>, you're <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- that's what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>" Yes, "Yeah," Yeah, you want it. "
I mean, little <unk> moment -- that I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't have to do it, I'm not <unk>.
But it's not a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk>, a couple of <unk> <unk> when there's just that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you will say, "Why?"
"Who is <unk>?"
The world is the <unk>. What I could I do?
When there are hundreds of <unk>, and they <unk> a <unk>, and you'll <unk>, and you'll <unk> you who's the <unk>, it's <unk> that the <unk> are.
<unk> could be better.
With hundreds of <unk> available, we're not <unk> for the <unk>.
So when people are doing decisions, even if the result is <unk>, you know, you know, you know, they <unk> them to them them.
In the last years, the <unk> <unk> in the world.
I think that a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have <unk> <unk> experiences because the <unk> are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation that <unk> is their.
So the final result is that we're in general, we're going to <unk>, but we <unk> it.
I'll say you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we're going to do good and it's completely <unk>.
There's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is not <unk> that much much choice is not <unk> that much choice is not <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit.
There's a <unk> <unk>, <unk>. I don't know what it's.
But I'm sure we've <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our life.
Now, from the <unk> <unk> -- I've almost been <unk> -- from the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> is the <unk>.
What allows all this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you have <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice.
The problem is that they have too <unk>.
So, the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> of <unk>, <unk> society.
And what does <unk> and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> are <unk>.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, it's not that they are just <unk>.
They are <unk> <unk>.
They do it <unk>.
If a little bit of what in our society allows us to be <unk> <unk>.
This is what the <unk> call a <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of the <unk> of the income income, not only to the poor -- because of this choice is <unk> that we <unk> us.
So, to end, "<unk>, you can become all you want --
<unk>, people, <unk>, <unk>: "But what <unk> <unk>?"
"It's <unk> that you can't make anything in a <unk> of the glass."
"A <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk> --
and I <unk> it, I <unk> it so, at the beginning.
But then, <unk>, instead, I <unk> that the fish knows that fish's a long <unk> knows.
Because the reality of the fact of the <unk>, if you <unk> <unk>, it's not possible to <unk> the <unk>.
If you can <unk> the <unk> way that all <unk> possible to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> the <unk>, and <unk> the <unk>.
Everybody need a <unk>.
This is almost almost of course too, maybe even for the fish, and they're <unk> for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and, for the <unk>.
Thank you.
